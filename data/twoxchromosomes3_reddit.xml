Well, things have been hard for me lately... Sometimes he's really attentive and sweet, but other times it's as if I'm not there. 
I've also gained some weight since we've gotten together; maybe about 15-20lbs. So, I know I don't look like I did when we started dating. I get the feeling sometimes that he's not attracted to me anymore. He used to tell me how pretty I was, but now the only thing he says is that I'm hot and that's ONLY during sex. Now, I don't need to be told that I'm pretty all of the time, but when I really try to look good for him, it goes unnoticed. When I confronted him about it, he told me he shouldn't have to validate me. He said I should be able to do that for myself. 
Well, (and I know this is going to make me sound like OAG, but...) I was just looking at his Reddit posts and he has commented on pictures of other guys' girlfriends, telling them how gorgeous (a word he NEVER uses with me) they are and, from the pictures, they are about the same size as me...
I'm sorry for such a long post, but am I just feeling insecure or do I have a legitimate reason for feeling as upset as I do??

Thanks for taking the time to read...  It's hard to say without more details, but it seems like the relationship has lost some of it's spark for him. It could be the weight you gained, or maybe it's just the year and a half itch. What you should do is try to reignite it. If he doesn't respond, however, you may need to face the fact that he doesn't feel like he needs to treat you the way you want to be treated, and that the relationship may need to end if it bothers you that much. 

And while you shouldn't take to heart what he says over Reddit, it does seem a little bit strange that he's commenting on other guy's girlfriends.  How do I reignite it? Do something out of the ordinary, really nice for him. Surprise him with a nice dinner. Randomly give him a massage. Pay close attention to him. Random blowjob. Anything that would make him say, "Wow, I was not expecting this." I already do this kind of stuff for him Think of something else you could do to make him feel special, and see if he responds by making you feel special as well.  I guess I can try. I've done just about everything How much does he do for *you*? I mean, no, you shouldn't expect to get exactly what you give in a relationship, but if you're receiving no recognition whasoever for all the things you do...Food for thought. How do I reignite it?  He is right, he shouldn't have to validate you... But he's your boyfriend! He should WANT to tell you you're pretty, because he's bursting with joy over the fact he has such a beautiful girlfriend! It's normal for some spark to go away, but not to the point where he only compliments you during sex. I would sit him down and have an honest talk about your attraction levels towards each other and how you would like more verbal affirmation. Maybe take the love languages test together? What's the love languages test?  I wouldn't feel comfortable with a bf commenting on pictures of other guy's girlfriends. Are you? It seems a bit strange, but I don't know. Context is everything.

At the end of the day, if you're not feeling reciprocated in love in the relationship, trust your gut. Especially if you are young, now is not the time to stay in it for the long haul. You do deserve someone who is appreciative and excited about you. That being said, you won't find that until you really feel great about yourself. Then it will become super obvious when your admiration for yourself far exceeds your boyfriends, and the relationship will just naturally fall apart. You can end up attracting someone who matches you more.

For me, feeling my independence helped with this. I loved myself more every day as I felt how complete I was in myself... how strong I was on my own. It also really helped with my physical image. I'm sure the process is different for everybody... best of luck :).
 I think the hardest thing here for me is that I was bullied from an early age by my step grandmother. She called me fat (I was underweight) and ugly. He knows all of this.  Does he know that this still has an impact on you?From the way you're trying to salvage the relationship, it seems like you really care about him. Maybe try sitting me down and being like "hey, CUPCAKEFACE, I know you've said before you shouldn't need to validate me and that's right. But, sometimes I do make an effort to look pretty, like (give an example), and when you don't mention it it's hard for me to feel like you notice. I'm sure you do, but I want to feel that. Next time you notice, can you mention it? I can't tell what you're thinking."(assuming his name is cupcakeface) I think the hardest thing here for me is that I was bullied from an early age by my step grandmother. She called me fat (I was underweight) and ugly. He knows all of this.  Well it sounds like you are very valid in having your self-image issues. However, you can't hold onto them forever. Don't make it a "story" and then an "excuse" for how you feel about yourself that you hold onto your entire life. It's just a waste of your time. Better start now on feeling your inner confidence and admiration of your body. For your own inner well-being and also to help relieve your partner of feeling that you are being co-dependent. (This is not to say that there may be valid issues in your relationship currently. It is impossible for us to tell over the internet... that's for you to decide).

One simple thing that works for me - though it sounds silly... is to lie down alone and just place your hand on areas that need love and send them loving energy. Sometimes the best path is gentle, not forceful. Over time, I've found my ability to be good to my body improve a lot :)</snippet></document><document><title>Questions about the diva cup...</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1945ar/questions_about_the_diva_cup/</url><snippet>Would a diva cup help with cramping/endo pains/etc? I don't know much about cups, don't mock me if I'm totally wrong...  It may depend on whether you're talking about standard cramping or endometriosis pains. I've participated in a number of sexual/reproductive/menstrual health forums online for years, and from there, the consensus about cups seems to be --

For people experiencing standard cramping, cups sometimes help and sometimes don't. For people experiencing endo pain, it seems like cups only rarely make a difference.   I find mine helped the cramps somewhat, although not noticeably enough to count on it as a remedy. As for the comment on messiness, it was a bit awkward the first 4 or 5 months but I haven't had another mess in the 3 years I've used it. Oh, cool. Maybe I'll give them a shot after all. Or, wait, how comparable are they to tampons? I can't use tampons because I'm super sensitive to TSS. =/ To the best of my knowledge, no association has been found between cups and TSS. This may be because cups collect rather than absorb fluid (and so don't produce microabrasions in the vagina), but it also may be because there haven't been significant studies done of menstrual cup users and TSS.  Oh, cool. Maybe I'll give them a shot after all. Or, wait, how comparable are they to tampons? I can't use tampons because I'm super sensitive to TSS. =/     Probs not... at least no more than pads. Besides, the cups themselves are a pain! They're messy to put in and take out and if you don't put them in correctly they leak like a mofo. They're an awesome idea, but seriously impractical.

EDIT: Sorry, when I said impractical I meant for me... A period is, in its very nature, personal and if no one liked the cups they wouldn't still be around! Also, being made of silicone they would, in theory, eliminate the TSS. An alternative though, if TSS is your main concern, could be all natural 100% cotton tampons as studies show that TSS is caused by the bleach used in synthetic tampons to turn them white and the absorbing materials like rayon. Are not. The cups are freaking awesome, you might have had an idea but don't claim they are impractical for everyone. They are a bit messy but as you only need to change twice daily who cares and I've never had a leak. The cup is a life saver.  Are not.

I have self-esteem issues (along with a multitude of others) and I always hated the idea of him watching porn.


A few months ago, he told me he stopped watching it because he knew it hurt me. I never asked him to stop, he chose to. But then one night I used his computer and saw a ton of porn from the past few weeks. So, he TOLD me he stopped, but kept it hidden and watched it several nights a week. While he had &#8220;stopped&#8221;, I had kind of come to terms with it and thought I&#8217;d be okay if he started again, but seeing the porn on his computer hurt me deeply and I realized I wasn&#8217;t okay with it. Regardless, I tried to forget about it because I know it&#8217;s his business.

However, now every time I think about him watching porn, I don&#8217;t want to have sex with him. We usually see each other 4-5 days a week, but we recently went 2 weeks without seeing each other. Normally we sex-Skype to feel better, but he never asked me once to do it in the entire time we were apart, even though I kept saying how sexually frustrated I was. I didn&#8217;t masturbate the whole time we were apart, thinking we&#8217;d be Skyping. I know it&#8217;s because he was watching porn and getting off the whole time. It hurts my feelings that he would choose that over Skyping with me, which has always been a favorite of ours. I thought about asking him a few times, but it wasn&#8217;t as appealing to me knowing he&#8217;d been getting off the whole time whereas I hadn&#8217;t. Plus, like I said, thinking about him watching porn turns me off.

So now I don&#8217;t know what to do. It&#8217;s not my place to ask him to stop, and even if I did, he would just tell me he&#8217;d stopped and keep doing it in secret. But I don&#8217;t know how to get past this pure hatred of him watching porn. I can&#8217;t get it out of my head, and now I don&#8217;t want to have sex with him anymore thinking about it. I tried to bring up the Skype thing and he suggested we try building up with teasing until the next time we see each other, but I don&#8217;t even want to do that, because the idea of being sexual with him right now isn&#8217;t even a little bit appealing. I have to see him in 3 days and I don&#8217;t want to have sex with him. 

I don&#8217;t know why this is SO hurtful for me. I thought I was over it. I discussed it with my therapist and everything. I even know, logically, as he&#8217;s explained to me so many times, he isn&#8217;t looking at the women but the act. I guess I feel like at this point, it&#8217;s starting to affect our sex life. We never do sexy-Skype anymore when we&#8217;re apart. He never asks me for sexy pictures like he used to. His sex drive in general has gone down, but if anything, his life is less stressful since he&#8217;s done with school for the time being and doesn&#8217;t have a job, so it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s more stressed than usual. The only thing I can think of is that porn is starting to take the place of the things we used to share, like sexy photos and Skyping. And I guess part of it is my self-esteem problems. He&#8217;s seemingly less interested in me but more interested in porn, so it makes me feel bad about myself. 

I guess I&#8217;m just looking for advice from ladies who have been there before. How did you get over it? What ended up fixing the problem?

**TL;DR - My boyfriend watches porn, I thought I was okay with it, but now it seems like it's interfering with our sex life.**        [deleted] &amp;gt; He may not be jerking off to porn instead of skyping you. You don't actually KNOW that. This is an assumption you are making. You could have jerked yourself off. There is nothing wrong with that at all.


No, I know he is. When I brought up the Skype thing, he said he'd jacked off this week, and I know he can't jack off without porn. He's told me a hundred times. 


&amp;gt; There was no change until you found out about the porn. 

When did I say that? There was a change. I just didn't know what was causing it. I thought maybe stress or something going on between us. Now I know how much porn he's been watching, and I am starting to see a pattern in his sexual attraction to me decreasing as he watches porn. My sex drive has not changed at all. However, the changes in his have been going on for a few weeks now. But normally, no matter what, 2 weeks of not being together would at least lead to some sexy talk or *anything*. But the entirety of the two weeks were devoid of any sexy talk, despite my attempts to get us there. He didn't want to Skype, he didn't want photos, he didn't want to even talk about sex. That's completely out of character for him, but once he admitted that he'd been jacking off this week, it made sense. He's been watching porn and getting off to that, but not even trying to be sexual with me (not even a little bit) despite not seeing me for 2 weeks. As I said in my post, that's quite a long time for us. 
 [deleted]  Of course it's your place to ask him to stop. You can't force him, that's on him (and hopefully he has a conscience that will kick in), but you can ask him to stop. Tell him how you perceive that it's negatively affecting your sex life, so he doesn't brush it off as "meh girls don't like porn." Make sure he knows that while you realize he doesn't actually like the girls more than he likes you, it still takes away from your sex life. He gets his endorphin kick from watching other people instead of indulging with you, which leaves you out, but also his porn habits turn you off from him, which leaves him out. 

I know that a lot of the time girls try to dismiss feeling put off by boyfriends' porn habits by saying it's their choice and we can't make them stop-- While admittedly porn is usually one of the more harmless questionable things that can happen, it can easily cross a line and this has probably happened with you and your boyfriend. 

As for me, sure I watch some porn, as did my ex-of-3-wks-ago-boyfriend (ex for unrelated reasons! heh). But I found out that he'd paid for porn before, and for some reason that I still can't articulate, it weirded me the FUCK out. I mean, there's enough full-length HD porn for free out there with decent actresses, the fuck does he need to spend money on?? So I told him how I felt, and that while I wasn't going to actively try to stop him, I hoped he'd feel bad if he spent money on porn again. I can't be sure if he did or not, but our sex life was certainly never lacking so I put it out of my mind. 

Moral of my story, it's your right to be firm about what you want, especially if your sex life and intimacy is on the line.  Well the problem is, I don't want to assume about the porn if that's not what's causing the issues between us. He has a lot of shame issues related to porn, so being accused of it causing a problem is only going to fuck him up more about it. I can't say for sure if the porn is the reason that he seems more sexually disconnected from me, but it seems like a pretty good idea. Shame issues how? He watches things that he feels dirty about afterward, or he feels guilty for watching in the first place? Feels undeserving because he watched it? His parents told him when he was younger that he was a pervert for watching it, and that's stuck with him ever since. He thinks of himself as a pervert, so he doesn't like talking about porn with me because he's so ashamed of it. That's why I'm asking here instead of talking to him about this - I don't want to bring it up to him because I don't want him to feel like he's a pervert. I don't think he is at all - I don't have a problem with the idea of porn, or other people watching porn. But it makes me feel bad that he watches it, and while I could get past it when it had nothing to do with me, I can't just get past it when it starts to affect our sex life.

Moral of my story, it's your right to be firm about what you want, especially if your sex life and intimacy is on the line.  I think you are wrong to say that she, or anyone else, has a right to ask someone else to stop masturbating or dictate how they masturbate. Masturbation is by definition pleasuring oneself, so you're effectively saying that it's okay for one person to tell another person to stop making themselves happy or change the way they make themselves happy.

Who decided that your man has a problem with porn?

My man watches porn *a lot* and knows *a lot* of the porn stars and we are long distance most of the time (for now) in our relationship. So I know for a fact that he's orgasming to another woman's image far more than he is to mine and/or far more than he's having sex with me.

That doesn't change that he thinks I'm pretty hot and wants me to touch his penis as often as logistics and our bodies can handle.

Just because he jacks-off to porn doesn't necessarily mean he wants you any less.. Porn is a guys way of being with any woman he wants; for instance, those that are too hott for him to get with in real life, those who are taboo for one reason or another, and those he would never be with while in a relationship because he doesn't want to hurt the woman he cares about.

I get it; I'm an insecure girl too. But I also see the other side of the coin. And honestly, I'd rather my man jack-off to hours of porn than cheat on me once.

So he didn't Skype-sex with you, maybe he was legitimately busy? And how do you **know** he was watching porn the whole time? To me, it seems like you're jumping to the worst conclusions possible (likely because of insecurities). Your man is with you for a reason, and judging from you getting so sexually frustrated in two weeks, I'd venture to say that he thinks you're pretty hot and wants to bone you often. If it's affecting my sex life, it's a problem to me. He also sees it as a problem, but not enough to change it.

&amp;gt; those that are too hott for him to get with in real life

That...makes me feel awesome. Thanks.

&amp;gt; And how do you know he was watching porn the whole time? To me, it seems like you're jumping to the worst conclusions possible

Because he said he'd jacked off, and he cannot jack off without porn. He has told me that a thousand times - he cannot get off on his own without porn. 

EDIT:

&amp;gt; So he didn't Skype-sex with you, maybe he was legitimately busy?

He probably wasn't. He doesn't have a job and he's not in school. He lives at home and does nothing but sit at home and play video games/watch movies all day. He does hang out with friends occasionally, but not today or this week as far as he's told me. Did you tell you that he thinks his watching of porn is a problem? If he hasn't told you that and he's not willing to change it, he might not see it as a problem. Obviously I don't know for sure because I haven't talked to him, but again, there seems to be a disconnect between what he thinks and what you think based on the things you've said.

Why did my comment about other hott women make you feel "awesome"? I nowhere in my post made a negative comment about your looks and towards the end I even indirectly called you hott. Guys want to bone more than one hott woman so the porn star being hott or not doesn't say anything about your own level of attractiveness. Again, you seem to be jumping to the worst possible conclusion.

Men are visually stimulated creatures. There's scientific research into it, but I am admittedly too lazy too look it up to insert here. But being about to see what arouses them is a large part of what gets a man off. So, his assertion that he can't jack-off without porn makes sense to me.

And if that's his situation, **he** might be struggling with what's going on in his life. Maybe he's not entirely happy with where he's at not having a job and living at home. Maybe his way of dealing with it is jacking-off and using orgasms as a coping mechanism, which may be a clue to why he's so unwilling to give it up.

Either way, I think there needs to be some serious discussion occurring between you and him. &amp;gt; Why did my comment about other hott women make you feel "awesome"?

Because the way you worded it came off as, "He jacks off to those women because he can't get with someone that hot in real life". Insinuating that he's settling for me and jacking off to them since he can't possibly get a woman that hot in real life. I don't really think that was a huge leap, I think you worded it very poorly. 

&amp;gt; Either way, I think there needs to be some serious discussion occurring between you and him.

I don't know what to say. I don't want to tell him to stop watching porn, because a) I don't want to be a controlling bitch, and b) he wouldn't stop even if I asked, so what's the point? He knows I don't like it. I don't know how to bring up the issue without it sounding like I'm asking him to stop, and I feel like we've discussed it as much as we can without it being repetitive. I've told him how I felt, he's tried explaining it to me, etc. It doesn't get us anywhere.  Who decided that your man has a problem with porn?

So no, I never "forbade" him from watching porn. I told him honestly that it bothered me. He chose to stop. He chose to "stop" because he wanted to make you happy and you told him that his watching it made you unhappy.

Boy want us to be happy; boys also like masturbating to porn.

You need to talk to him because it's obvious to me that there is a disconnect between what you're feeling &amp;amp; what you want him to do &amp;amp; and you want from him and what he wants to do &amp;amp; what he's feeling &amp;amp; what he understands you want from him.</snippet></document><document><title>Bitch Magazine Suggests 100 Young Adult Books for the Feminist Reader</title><url>http://bitchmagazine.org/100-young-adult-books-for-the-feminist-reader</url><snippet>  Tamora Pierce is literally the perfect feminist author for women who like adventure stories and fantasy and magic.

I'm not so sure about *Sloppy Firsts* being on there. I read the series in high school and it seemed to be filled with slut shaming and "not-like-other-girls" syndrome. You shouldn't limit yourself to reading books that you agree with.  That book represents a common mindset that should be understood if it is to be consciously avoided.        </snippet></document><document><title>Books written by women for a Vonnegut lover?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193gi9/books_written_by_women_for_a_vonnegut_lover/</url><snippet>Lately I've been struggling to be interested in any book I pick up. I love authors like Vonnegut and David Foster Wallace, but would love to find books by female authors (and with an actual female point of view) that have that same feeling of insight. Basically, I'm very sad that my favorite authors have such a negative attitude about women. Any suggestions out there? 


UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your recommendations! Looks like I have some reading to do :) 


EDIT: I can grammar.  maybe Margaret Atwood, she has lots of books to choose from too Doesn't she write science fiction?   Doesn't she write science fiction?   Doesn't she write science fiction?   So did Vonnegut, kind of (though he disagreed with the application of that label to his writing). Check out Cat's Cradle and Welcome to the Monkey House.  No, no thank you.  I've read vonnegut, he isn't really science fiction in the same way atwood is.  I just, I think it should be pointed out to OP because I don't think she was really looking for science fiction.  Wallace, is, after all very far from science fiction.  It would seem that the area where those two authors meet is also very far from science fiction.   I didn't realize OP wasn't interested in sci-fi - I haven't read any of Wallace's works, so I can't comment on that. The works that I mentioned above remind me of Atwood, especially The Handmaid's tale. So, OP, if you read those Vonnegut and liked them, check out Atwood. And if you weren't so into the more sci-fi stuff that Vonnegut wrote, maybe don't read Atwood.  Doesn't she write science fiction?   Doesn't she write science fiction?   Doesn't she write science fiction?   maybe Margaret Atwood, she has lots of books to choose from too I will have to check this out - thank you for the suggestion! Do you have a favorite title by any chance?  The Handmaid's Tale! Then Oryx and Crake! I will have to check this out - thank you for the suggestion! Do you have a favorite title by any chance?

 /r/books would work too!  You may wanna cross post this to r/booksuggestions. :)
   Those are two of my favourite authors as well. Angela Carter's *The Passion of New Eve* comes to mind. It's feminist and weird and well-written. Or maybe Joanna Russ? Octavia Butler is often cited for her female-positive writing. I like her stuff, but it's not my favourite.  I'm actually doing a study right now on women characters in postmodern lit. I think Tropic of Orange by Yamashita would be right up your alley, and I have to say Margaret Atwood too! Try The Robber Bride or Handmaid's Tale. People have been going the sci-fi route, so I have to suggest The Female Man by Joanna Russ or The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K LeGuin. For my study I'm also using I Was a Teenage Fairy by Francesca Lia Block (because it is speculative fiction) although it's young adult. Also a great literary graphic novel is Fun Home by Alison Bechdel. I'm actually doing a study right now on women characters in postmodern lit.

I will have to check it out. Short stories and essays are my jam lately.   i'm in the same boat myself. Ursula K. Le Guin is a great feminist sci-fi writer, i recommend checking her out. I am not much of a sci-fi reader, but I loved Le Guin. I also recommend Octavia E. Butler. I have also been recommended Robin McKinley, a fantasy author.

Some female authors I love include: Toni Morrison, Ana&#239;s Nin, Jeanette Winterson, Alice Walker, Joyce Carol Oates, Maya Angelou, Isabel Allende, Zadie Smith, Zora Neale Hurston, Anne Lamott, Simone de Beauvoir, Jhumpa Lahir, Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen, Joan Didion. i'm in the same boat myself.

I loved reading Le Guin but only one book in the trilogy "Wizard of Earthsea" is from a female perspective. Does she have others with female main characters? Yeah, try *The Mists of Avalon*. IIRC it's entirely from a female perspective. It focuses on Guinevere and Morgana le Fay from the Arthurian legends.  Seriously, you *must* try Kelly Link &#8212; especially her short story collection *Magic for Beginners*. She has the same fragmented, funny-but-serious kind of style as Vonnegut and Foster Wallace, but she's feminist and most of her viewpoint characters are female.

I only like the early ones, though. Same for Alice Walker. I love Kingsolver, but couldn't finish the Poisonwood Bible. I suppose my attention span just isn't long enough for such a long book. I absolutely loved The Bean Trees and Animal Dreams though. Animal Dreams enters my thoughts almost every day.  Have you read Barbara Kingsolver? I only like the early ones, though. Same for Alice Walker. I also love Alice Walker, but have surprisingly only ever read her poetry. I somehow made it through high school and college without ever reading *The Color Purple*.   Give Carson McCullers a try. Drastically different subject matter from Vonnegut, but some of the same general feelings. Any particular titles you like?   </snippet></document><document><title>Horrible gyno refused to tell me what he was testing me for :S and prescribed me Yaz</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/192v7p/horrible_gyno_refused_to_tell_me_what_he_was/</url><snippet>I had a horrible experience with a gynecologist today and have questions! Basically I was referred to him due to suspected endometriosis, due to extreme period pain that started when I went off the pill plus nearly all women in my family having it. 

He dismissed the idea that I might have endometriosis and told me I could cure my period pain if I had a baby. We'd already discussed that my partner has had a vasectomy and that we would not be having children (he was very dismissive of me when I said this). He then did a physical exam (awfully painful, I told him this but he continued to be very rough and acted like it was my fault I was in so much pain) and said he was going to test me for a 'vaginal infection' as I had 'discharge'. I have never had abnormal discharge (only really notice anything around ovulation, when I have some clear discharge) and when I checked later there was nothing. He flat out refused to tell me what he was testing me for and I am quite upset as I have no idea what it could be? Does anyone have any ideas? I have to wait two weeks for the results!

I have had no symptoms other than extremely painful periods and some abdominal pain sometimes. I had a pap test and std testing for chlamydia a month ago (both negative) and a full STD screen 18 months ago as did my partner (we are monogamous). He said that it is not tested for in normal STD testing and that no one considers it an STD other than him. 

He also prescribed me Yaz and did not explain what it did or the side effects. I have not filled out the script as the combined pill caused me migraines that landed me in hospital a number of times with suspected stroke (which I told him about) and I have no real idea what Yaz is (googling side effects has made me quite nervous about this). I went on the mini pill for years after that and was fine but he was dismissive of the fact I had ever been put on the mini pill (which I stopped due to my partner's vasectomy). I am thinking I should just stay away from a pill I have no idea about? 

I am never going back to him as he was so condescending and made me feel gross about myself and will go back to my GP for a new referral but in the mean time I have two weeks of worrying about these unknown tests he ran on me and what I might have! I cried for about an hour after my appointment. :(

**tl:dr gyno ran some tests on me, won't tell me what they are and prescribed me Yaz and I have no idea what that is. Very confused! :S**

*edit: thank you all for your comments so far. They have made me feel a LOT better. :)*  You should report him to the licensing board in your area. That was completely unacceptable.  This needs to be higher up in the comments. Not only was he unprofessional and terrible, but he gave you (what I would consider) negligent care.

Combined hormonal contraception is *contraindicated* in women with a history of migraines, stroke/clots/etc., and a number of other conditions. Especially Yaz, it's been shown to have a higher risk of clots than almost any other combined pill. If you took that script in to even a half-decent pharmacist, I *guarantee* he/she would not fill it. That sort of negligence is what lands health professionals in court or jail.

You need to report him. Up vote for the info on Yaz. Drospirenone, the progestin used in Yaz, is a relatively new progestin on the market and has been shown to have the highest risk of blood clotting. I thought I heard that it had been taken off the market, but I must have been mistaken.  This needs to be higher up in the comments. Not only was he unprofessional and terrible, but he gave you (what I would consider) negligent care.

You need to report him. That is what I figured from what I read online. If he thinks I should be on birth control to control my dysmenorrhea I don't see why he wouldn't just say to go back on the mini pill which worked great. The combined pill caused me about five years of frequent migraines, one lasting three weeks where I had complete numbness on my left side, which I ended up in hospital for being tested for stroke, MS, epilepsy and I forget what else. Given that out of my two neurologists, and multiple GPs that I saw about the issue none of them asked me if I was on the pill so maybe my reaction is very uncommon but still, it clearly means the combined pill is bad for me. Years later my university doctor asked me if I was on the pill as her first question when I described my symptoms and told me to stop talking the combined pill immediately. Have not had a migraine since.  And don't forget to Yelp that shit! Keep as many women as you can from seeing this dickbag. That is what I figured from what I read online.

You need to report him. ~~Beyond negligent care, it sounds like sexual assault to me.~~

~~&amp;gt;He then did a physical exam (awfully painful, I told him this but he continued to be very rough and acted like it was my fault I was in so much pain) and said he was going to test me for a 'vaginal infection' as I had 'discharge'.~~ 

~~It sounds like his "test" was a bogus claim and that he enjoyed/didn't care about the fact that he was causing pain to the OP. Just based on this excerpt, I would think this was sexual assault. I wonder if any of his other patients have gotten treatment like this before.~~ 

EDIT: Please disregard. I was both extremely exhausted and in a less than optimal mental state when I read this post and commented. I'm going to stick with saying that the OP had an awful doctor and I agree he should be reported.  I think making the jump from being a shitty doctor and providing shitty care to enjoying causing OP pain is a bit extreme. Even if he didn't enjoy it, he ignored the OP when she told him she was in pain. She says elsewhere that when she said it hurts, he poked again and said "here? that shouldn't hurt" or something to that effect. Disregarding everything else that happened, isn't that was doctors do? Investigate things that are hurting when they shouldn't be hurting?

I'm not condoning what the doc did nor am I trying to play down what OP experienced. I don't doubt what she experienced was traumatizing and supremely awful. But crying sexual assault and sadism is going a bit overboard in my opinion. When I read the post and posted my comment, I was extremely exhausted. Perhaps I wasn't thinking clearly.  Yaz is a combined pill so I would get a second opinion before taking it given your history. 

I would also *strongly* recommend you find a new gynecologist, this one sounds terrible. Yes I am going to book another GP appointment and get her to refer me to another one (a bit of a pain given I waited over a month to see this guy though!). My mum has recommended one - so I am sure my GP won't mind writing another letter for the one my mum recommended. I am considering lodging a complaint about this guy too but not sure if it is worth it. Wouldn't mind getting my $120 back for that joke of an appointment!

The only reason I am not still on the mini pill is because I don't need any contraceptive and was worried I'd be slack in taking it for that reason and that could have other ramifications. I never had any period pain or other symptoms whilst on it so it does not make sense to try a new birth control option if I can just go back to that but I will ask the new gynecologist.

Although I have had another male doctor perform a pap test and he was nice, I found that he was VERY rough also (none of the females who have done pap tests have been rough and caused much pain beyond general discomfort at a stranger poking at my bits) so am thinking I should just stick with female doctors now for any gyno issues. I feel a bit bad being biased towards males in this area though...  You should write a complaint. 100% you should. Don't fear what might happen to him, as his conduct was not appropriate for a doctor.

My gyno is male and he is not rough when doing his exams, however if you feel more comfortable with a women continue to see them. I can guarantee you no men are losing their practices because women prefer female doctors. You should write a complaint. 100% you should.

My gyno is male and he is not rough when doing his exams, however if you feel more comfortable with a women continue to see them. I can guarantee you no men are losing their practices because women prefer female doctors. Losing patients isn't the issue - the issue is soft sexism. I don't think it's wrong to want a specific sex of person looking at your junk and getting all up in there. If you're more comfortable with a woman, then go for it. If you're more comfortable with a man, do that. If you're a man who is more comfortable with a male urologist, that's also fine. It's such a personal decision and a very uncomfortable place to be that I can't imagine telling someone that not going to a doctor who makes them uncomfortable because of their sex is bad or wrong. Not going to a doctor who makes you uncomfortable for any reason is acceptable, especially when that doctor will be spending a lot of time feeling up your breasts and poking around your vagina (or in the case of a urologist, spending time with your penis and testicles) which makes me uncomfortable enough anyway. [How far are you willing to defend your premise?](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/02/20/no-black-nurses-request-draws-lawsuit/) [How far are you willing to defend your premise?](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/02/20/no-black-nurses-request-draws-lawsuit/) You can't be serious with that. LilBoots makes a legitimate point that has nothing to do with racism or sexism. If you aren't comfortable with someone of the opposite gender looking at your junk, that doesn't make you a monster. Modesty concerning the exposure of your ladybits or breasts (or penis and testicles for men) is common, there are still separate locker rooms and restrooms for men and women, after all. But maybe that's sexist in your eyes too? The locker room/restroom thing is a battle I wouldn't choose to fight, but otherwise yes, I'm quite serious about it.  The basic question is this: is it okay to be biased when it comes to medical care?  We look at gynecology and think "Oh yes, of course it's okay to be biased," but then we look at the asshole who didn't want any black nurses handling his newborn baby, and we cringe.  Why is one acceptable and the other is not?  If a gyno patient has PTSD issues, then I wouldn't question her decision, but from OP's comments (men rough, women not) I'd say that wouldn't be her motivation.  Like I said, it's an issue of soft sexism - we have a ready-made justification for judging a man *solely* by his gender, and women on this forum leap to defend it.  The bottom line is this: if you have a gender/race bias when it comes to health care (which is *not* a sexual activity), then the problem lies with you.

I'm not gonna feel bad because I prefer to have a female gynecologist over a male one. Even though a visit to the gynecologist is not a sexual situation, it is an intimate one, and I get to choose who touches my body in an intimate way. Furthermore, I am very suspicious of people crying about sexism towards men, for the same reason that I think "reverse racism" is absolute bullshit.

You could try the implant as it's a progesterone only contraceptive, like the mini pill, but they put it in your arm and you don't have to think about it for 3 years :) Oh yes my sister has that I think! The main reason I am trying to avoid the pill is because I am so much more sensitive (for sex) without it. Even though it comes with two days of horrible agony each month it makes it worth it! I really wanted to be able to discuss all these options today and work out what is best but it was Yaz or nothing!  I'm sure you've heard this before, but do you start taking ibuprofen 24h before your symptoms are set to start? A lot of doctors recommend that because of the way that ibuprofen works. It can help to prevent pain over a slightly longer term than it relieves it normally. Oh yes my sister has that I think!

&amp;gt;No health plan barriers to OB-GYN services: The new rules also prohibit health plans from requiring a referral from a primary care provider before you can seek coverage for obstetrical or gynecological (OB-GYN) care from a participating OB-GYN specialist.

http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/rights/doctor-choice/index.html I am in Australia so do need a referral. Some GPs specialise in gynecological issues and you don't need any referral but I went to one of them and they said for me to go to a specialist.   Complain to the relevant authorities where you live. He was very unprofessional. Refusing to tell his patient what the tests were for? Unheard of! Being deliberately rough? Assault. 

So sorry you had to go through this. Yes at one point I said 'ouch that is so painful' and he poked me hard again and said 'there?? That shouldn't hurt' UGH. I went straight home and after being upset for a while I had sex with my boyfriend (my suggestion!) as I hate when my vagina's last experience is negative (that sounds a bit trite but it really made me feel better). Also I felt really like something was wrong with my vagina after this but it was SO reassuring that my boyfriend was so upset with this guy too and wasn't freaked out and thinking there was something wrong with me too and wasn't turned off.

The most common tests you typically send discharge samples for gonnorhea, chlamydia, bacterial vaginosis (so gardnerella), or trich. Based on the comment that "he's the only one that considers this an STD" I'm thinking he's suspecting trich which if I recall correctly doesn't have an actual standing recommended protocol for testing for it, which is what he could be referring to. And trich is treated with Metronidazole, the same medicine for BV so... not a big deal. What a dick.  Ok thanks. Do you know why he would not tell me what I was being tested for?  I can see that they are both easily treated. He refused multiple times to tell me. I did say to him that I wanted to know what it was because I have a partner and I don't want to pass anything on to him or put him at risk (though I am sure it is a bit late for that but even so...). 

Also I have had zero symptoms of either of them from what I have read. Is it very likely that I might have BV or trich? Even though a lot of what he said sounded stupid (telling me that endometriosis is an 'old woman's disease' for example) it's hard not to second guess yourself when you are seeing a specialist who is probably in his 60s so should know what he is doing. He told me I could have had them since I lost my virginity (13 years ago).  Um...endometriosis is an old woman's disease? Thats just...I feel dumber for having read that. I'm in my third year of american medical school, so I can't say anything about your problem with any certainty but if I were you I would not take anything that guy said seriously as it seems he has not updated his clinical knowledge since his medical training 40 years ago. Furthermore, I have no idea why any doctor would withhold information from a patient besides knowing that what he is doing is a mistake or maybe that old school "I'm the doctor and I know best and you shouldn't question anything I do" mindset. 

And if you don't have any symptoms I'd say its pretty unlikely you have BV or trich. Gonn/chlamydia can be asymptomatic but you said you are monogamous and had been previously tested so again quite unlikely. I think your plan is good-go back to your GP, get a new referral to someone else and absolutely complain about this guy. This isn't 70s anymore, you shouldn't be able to treat your patients like shit and get away with it. Well yes I have never heard it was an old woman's disease - I thought it can be any age and primarily reproductive years (I am 28). He said I wouldn't show symptoms until my late 30s or 40s if I had it. My sister was in her late teens when they diagnosed her. My mother was never diagnosed but had the same symptoms as my sister until she had me and most of my other relatives it was discovered in their 30s when they could not conceive. 

Yea I really doubt I have an STD as I have had testing done before (and after the symptoms I went to him for started, very coincidental that they started soon after I quit the pill!) Even if he suspects this I don't know why he couldn't tell me this! Well yes I have never heard it was an old woman's disease - I thought it can be any age and primarily reproductive years (I am 28).

Even if he suspects this I don't know why he couldn't tell me this! Um...endometriosis is an old woman's disease? Thats just...I feel dumber for having read that. I'm in my third year of american medical school, so I can't say anything about your problem with any certainty but if I were you I would not take anything that guy said seriously as it seems he has not updated his clinical knowledge since his medical training 40 years ago. Furthermore, I have no idea why any doctor would withhold information from a patient besides knowing that what he is doing is a mistake or maybe that old school "I'm the doctor and I know best and you shouldn't question anything I do" mindset. 

And if you don't have any symptoms I'd say its pretty unlikely you have BV or trich. Gonn/chlamydia can be asymptomatic but you said you are monogamous and had been previously tested so again quite unlikely. I think your plan is good-go back to your GP, get a new referral to someone else and absolutely complain about this guy. This isn't 70s anymore, you shouldn't be able to treat your patients like shit and get away with it. Ok thanks. Do you know why he would not tell me what I was being tested for?  I can see that they are both easily treated. He refused multiple times to tell me. I did say to him that I wanted to know what it was because I have a partner and I don't want to pass anything on to him or put him at risk (though I am sure it is a bit late for that but even so...). 

Also I have had zero symptoms of either of them from what I have read. Is it very likely that I might have BV or trich? Even though a lot of what he said sounded stupid (telling me that endometriosis is an 'old woman's disease' for example) it's hard not to second guess yourself when you are seeing a specialist who is probably in his 60s so should know what he is doing. He told me I could have had them since I lost my virginity (13 years ago).  He could be thinking it's PID. That would explain the comment about it him thinking it's a STD and if you had pain during the procedure, it could also explain that too. Maybe he didn't want to freak you out so he's retesting you for everything.  Yes I think you are right and that could be a reason but it is more freaky to not have any idea what might be wrong with you for two weeks! He was just so condescending about it. I am an adult and can handle knowing potential outcomes. 

I didn't know doctors could test you and refuse to tell you what the tests are for :(

I never have pain during intercourse or my pap tests so not sure if PID is likely. Also I said I never had discharge and then he pulled out a swab and waved it in my face saying 'see! you do have discharge!' I mean I am not a doctor so couldn't tell if the swab was normal or not.  He waved a used swab in your face? That's...incredibly gross. Yes I think you are right and that could be a reason but it is more freaky to not have any idea what might be wrong with you for two weeks! He was just so condescending about it.

He told me I could have had them since I lost my virginity (13 years ago).  The most common tests you typically send discharge samples for gonnorhea, chlamydia, bacterial vaginosis (so gardnerella), or trich. Based on the comment that "he's the only one that considers this an STD" I'm thinking he's suspecting trich which if I recall correctly doesn't have an actual standing recommended protocol for testing for it, which is what he could be referring to. And trich is treated with Metronidazole, the same medicine for BV so... not a big deal. What a dick.   Yaz is a combined pill that can have terrible effects on migraines (especially migraines with auras...the doctor should have known this), so I would DEFINITELY hold off on taking it and seek a second option.  
  
I have no idea what he could be testing for, but he sounds like a crackpot and you should definitely complain. He definitely shouldn't get away with treating patients like shit and prescribing them things without taking their medical history into account.  
  
Sorry you had to deal with this. I hope you find a better gyno!  Yep I had migraines with auras. I have never had one since I came off the combined pill.   jees, why do so many women on here have awful, judgmental doctors with terrible communication skills? 

Where the heck are all the good doctors?  Part of it is probably confirmation bias... we don't hear about the good ones as often, since they're so normal! :)

I have to say, this sub has definitely taught me that it's okay to request a different doctor (and/or report their asses) if they aren't doing a good job. Everyone has this idea of "doctors are insanely smart, they must know what's best," even if they're a quack who hasn't updated their medical knowledge in 40 years and have the bedside manner of Dr. House. jees, why do so many women on here have awful, judgmental doctors with terrible communication skills? 

Where the heck are all the good doctors?  jees, why do so many women on here have awful, judgmental doctors with terrible communication skills? 

Where the heck are all the good doctors?   I'm so sorry you went through that. That sounded absolutely terrible!

Have you made a complaint about him yet?   What an ass. He was condescending, dismissive, and dumb. You always have a right to know what tests are being run. And he handed you a prescription for a combined pill after what you told him? I mean, fuck. I'm glad you have the sense and knowledge not to fill that script.

In addition to reporting him I'd request a copy of your records from his office to see exactly what he was doing. Some offices get touchy about it, but they're your records and you are absolutely entitled to a copy of them. You can also take them and any test results to your next doctor to avoid any duplicate tests. 
 Not sure I have this right in Australia. I seem to remember that it is not guaranteed but I will look into it. I have a copy of my script at least. Not sure I have this right in Australia. I seem to remember that it is not guaranteed but I will look into it. I have a copy of my script at least.    Hey OP, whoever said that he failed to get informed consent is correct. Also his information about endometriosis is wrong, and he was negligent in prescribing you Yaz. You can report him to AHPRA, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. The page you need to "Make a notification" - https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications-and-Outcomes/Conduct-Health-and-Performance/Make-a-Notification.aspx.

Things like this need to be reported, cause it hurts everyone for doctors like this to be allowed to keep practicing in such a dangerous way. 

Also don't feel like reporting him will jeopardise his career necessarily. They'll investigate and then they may just make him get better educated. But either way, there are loads of great younger obgyns in Australia. We don't need old guys who haven't kept up with current practice out there giving people bad advice and telling them what to do. I'm genuinely flabbergasted that any doctor thinks its ok to refuse to tell you what tests they're doing. That's flat out malpractice.    Call your state medical board and tell them you want to file a complaint. Especially regarding the test. He is responsible for obtaining your informed consent, and it sounds like he did not.
 http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics/patient-physician-relationship-topics/informed-consent.page I rung the doctors surgery just before and mentioned this (I am in Australia not US but the principle is the same when it comes to consent I just found out) and they said they could get my GP to write a new referral without me coming in (so no new fee) but suggested I talk to her if I wanted about my appointment so I am going to do this on Wednesday. She will be able to tell me what I was being tested for also. The receptionist told me he only rents a room on Saturdays with them and does not actually work but I could still lodge a complaint and they can address it.  You might also let your GP know how terrible your visit was. I don't know if it'd do anything, but there's a chance she'd stop referring people to the terrible gyno. Call your state medical board and tell them you want to file a complaint. Especially regarding the test. He is responsible for obtaining your informed consent, and it sounds like he did not.
 http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics/patient-physician-relationship-topics/informed-consent.page  Not only was he being unprofessional and negligent, refusing to tell you what he is 'testing' you for seems like good grounds to assume he was violating you.         I thought Yaz was taken off the market because too many people have died or had strokes because of it?  It was taken off the market in the US, OP is in Australia.  [deleted] [deleted] I prefer male gynos.   I once had a male gyno when I lived in San Diego. He was probably in his 70s and listened to all of my concerns and really was a wonderful doctor. I moved a couple years ago and miss having such a great doctor! A good doctor is worth his or her weight in gold.  Or in prescription drugs, which pound for pound are probably more valuable than gold.</snippet></document><document><title>Its the little things...

Firstly, I went to the DENTIST! I know this seems so trivial but because of a ridiculous and traumatizing event when I was a child I've had an irrational fear. I got a cavity taken care of that's been bugging me for a while! And for the FIRST TIME without using gas to knock me out.  

Secondly, I just did my eyebrows and they look amazing. I've never taken the time to actually draw out the right proportions before doing them and Im so happy I did (with tons of help from /r/MakeupAddiction!) everyone who does their own brows should try it. 

And lastly and most importantly, with the encouraging words and content from the women and men in this sub I finally feel worth something. Not only did I stand up for myself for the first time ever to a guy who was treating me very, very badly (and got the hell out of the (lack-thereof)relationship)  but also to my high school girl friends who have treated me disrespectfully for years. Im in university and was just home for reading week. Of course all the girls were home and of course I got them all together and of COURSE there was stupid, irrational drama. I try so hard to keep the peace between everyone and I'm so sick of it. I told them they needed to hear me out or leave me alone until they were able to cooperate without me. Luckily they did. I dont know if they'll really be able to function without me but I'm happy how it left off.  That, however, brings me to another reason why I'm happy....

.... little did those girls know that's the last they'll be seeing me for a long while. I havent told anyone but Im moving out into the world to be on my own. We come from a small town and as much as I love it, I'm leaving. Im moving on to bigger and better things.    Congrats with everything! Sometimes it's hard to get rid of friends you've had for so long. Even if they are too dramatic. So props to you. It really is the small things. I recently fixed some things around my home and rearranged and I'm so happy with it. Also do you have a specific link for the eyebrow thing?  I just looked everywhere for the post I used last night that had a bunch of tips with no luck! But I managed to use Google to find a really similar picture that helped me a ton!

http://professionaleyebrow.com/images/eyebrow-shap-1.jpg

I used a thread to make the lines and a pencil liner to mark the reference points. I gently traced the shape by "connecting the dots" shaping to how I like and then waxed and plucked anything outside of the lines.

Hope that helps at all!

I find it really sad that your first thought is about people being a threat to you in some way.

I have recently started to wonder if I don't get as wet as I should, or as most women do, when I get aroused.  I have some minimal sexual experience, but not enough to have a good idea of whether I just need more time to get wet, or if I should get something checked out, or what.

This came to mind mainly because I see people jokingly (and not so jokingly) saying how "it was like a waterfall down there" or that their panties were soaked.  I have never experienced either of these situations, even from masterbating. 

So do you really have THAT much coming out of you, or is that exaggeration?  I'm a guy, but I've been with some girls that only get as wet as a wet wipe and others that have moistened my mattress through bedding and thick towels.  In my experience, all vaginas are different.  Were the ones that were only as wet as a wet wipe wet enough for everything to go smoothly? Uh, short answer: sometimes. 

I'm not a big producer of pre-cum so often we'd have to use lube and with condoms it actually seemed to reduce the slickness even more.

Lube is no big deal.  If you feel awkward about incorporating lube you could massage each other with oil first.  If you're doing that, then what's another bottle?  Just be careful with oil and condoms! I know you meant to have an additional bottle of lube, but I thought I'd mention it just to be safe.     I....do not get very wet with m partner (never have). I do however, get wet on my own while watching porn, if not, I dont really get wet...

I've pretty much told my partner that sex can never happen without lube. I can get a little bit (wet as a wet wipe makes me giggle, but it works), but I think I will always need lube.  Have you tried incorporating porn into your foreplay?  </snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] Sad Truth</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/PvI9wKJ.jpg</url><snippet>  These are also the same people who oppose comprehensive sex education and easy access to birth control and family planning services.

I think it just comes down to the disapproval of young women having sex for fun.   

 I think it comes down to a puritanical view of sex and women: procreation only. They don't approve of women having sex if it isn't to make a child, but then they don't want to pay for anyone else's children even though they'll be happy to tell you exactly how you should raise your child. 

For instance, stay home and don't work. While its true that kids benefit from this, it just isn't practical in today's economy where you need a stable dual income to pay for basic necessities like rent, food, gas, and child care.

The hypocrisy is mind-blowing.  I had a.. well, a fight, on reddit the other day over this very thing.  I say a fight because I had to force myself to stop responding and I was pissed beyond belief.

Fast forward to now and my man's ex has been shooting up, we've got custody of the other kid and we're broke as hell.  

She called me irresponsible.  She said I shouldn't have had my baby.  Like you can plan that kind of stuff.

Did you mean to say "getting an abortion?"

Anyway, wow, what an obnoxious, holier than thou jackass. Now not only do you have to do everything "perfect" in their book to have a baby or sex, you have to have psychic abilities.

I fostered my own family for heavens sake, Im on BC and I think sex ed should be talked about in greater detail. No need to label society because some people say things like that. To make light for single mothers, If my tax money goes to support you and your baby thats great! We should be standing up for each other when no one else will. If you want to work to support your child then reduced child care should be in your favour. Being a single parent is hard enough with out economical stress. I understand that negative impacts more then the positive, but before you say "haters gonna hate" remember that there are a LARGE percentage of us to stand behind single mothers AND fathers and can be pro life aswell.  I find the term 'pro-life' offensive. Opposing abortion as a personal opinion is valid, legislating it as illegal isn't.  I find the term 'pro-life' offensive. Opposing abortion as a personal opinion is valid, legislating it as illegal isn't.  Im sorry that offends you. But the picture and discussion was about people who refer to themselves as pro lifers. There are things about pro choice that offend me but thats not what I commented on. I shed some light and positive feedback that not all people who are pro life are haters in the same sentence. I can not control your body or your choices, but I can have an opinion. And although we have different beliefs in that sense we need to stick together and support each other. Setting aside legality. If you live your life being offended at everything you wont be happy. And I cant make you happy. The fact that I say Hey yeah I do support life, But I support you, and empathize with you and your struggles. Maybe you can cut some slack just because the word pro life doesnt agree with you. And see that I still support you. I think were misunderstanding who the "hater" is now.  I think spicemilk's point was the term pro-life is offensive as it means anyone who isn't pro-life is anti-life. Seriously the term is offensive to those of us that are pro-choice.

Yeah once you keep your opinion out of other people's wombs that's fine. I always thought pro-life meant you were against abortion being available.

When i told them i was not having kids both the lady's asked me if something was wrong and pointed out there were always substitute mother and adoptions. When i explained i had no interest in having kids ever they looked at me like there was something morally wrong with me and started spouting the usual ''you will change your mind'', ''this is just a phase'' and ''you will regret it when you're old and alone''

Thank you gals :) If I really think its just a phase I don't say anything cause saying "it's just a phase" makes the subject say "no its not!!" which keeps them in the phase longer since they have to prove its not just a phase.

 And it's different when a teenager and a grown woman says it. I don't think I agree with that. I was 14 when I stopped eating meat, and everyone said it was just a phase. I've now been vegetarian for 19 years.

I have never wanted kids. When I was 8, 13, 19, 25, 30... Never. (I was recently told by a 19-year-old father that it's just a phase and I'll change my mind.) just because someone is a teenager when they say something doesn't mean it's a phase they'll grow out of. Frequently it's something they've known about themselves for a long time and just now feel confident enough to say.

Personal anecdotal, I've seen three woman make it to 30 declaring they'll never have children who changed their mind. Not saying you will (I'm sure there's plenty of people who feel like you do and never change that stance), just that this snap judgement has some real life experiences to back it up.

What I want to know is why do people feel the need to argue with someone about their reproductive choices? What is it about this topic in particular that makes people so bold.

When i explained i had no interest in having kids ever they looked at me like there was something morally wrong with me and started spouting the usual ''you will change your mind'', ''this is just a phase'' and ''you will regret it when you're old and alone''

Why cant people get it into they'r head some people just don't want kids?

**Edit** Wow 100 Up votes. I had no idea i would get such a response from one comment. Thank you gals :) "This is just a phase" might be right for some people, but it doesn't mean you should go around saying it.

...At 16, I had no idea if I wanted kids ever. At 20, I'm certain that I want a kid, just not now (in 5-7 years probably).

The difference is, people who realise that they haven't fully grown up yet usually say something like "I don't want kids now, who knows about later". Once you've decided that you *definitely* don't want kids, then no one has the right to question you. I have been rather determined since i was 14. I'm turning 24 this year and if anything i'm even more determined now than i was back then. So it's not just a phase for me. 

**Edit** Typos fixed. &amp;gt;determent

I don't want to be mean, but I do want to point out that this isn't the word you're thinking of before you use it in a situation where it actually matters.

You're probably looking for the word "determined." "Determent" is the act of deterring something. Thanks for pointing this out to me. English is not my 1st language and i still get some words wrong.  I kinda get similar response almost every time i tell some lady i'm staying child free.

Women say this to other women as well  and people say there's no need for feminism anymore. This is more an issue of the treating sex as a religious act than gender based discrimination. If there was a way of detecting men who have premarital sex, religious fanatics would be all over men too. Which they actually sometimes are (example would be priests who don't respect celibate). uh, not quite. and even if it was it still discriminates against women so my point still stands.

Since it takes a man's sperm to make a baby...wouldn't that be a clear sign? Or are the woman somehow generating premarital babies on their own.... &amp;gt;If there was a way of detecting men who have premarital sex, religious fanatics would be all over men too.

Since it takes a man's sperm to make a baby...wouldn't that be a clear sign? Or are the woman somehow generating premarital babies on their own.... It's not exactly apparent who is going to be the father.  Right...but just because paternity isn't readily obvious doesn't mean that you get to just glaze over the fact that there are *clearly* men out there who *are* engaging in premarital sex in order for pregnancy to take place. 

If you're going to shame women for sex, you can't completely ignore the other half of the equation.  Sure, but that is a trivial statement. The point is that the reason for not shaming men as much as women might not necessarily be discriminatory, but rather coincidental. I know what you're trying to say, but to me it just doesn't add up. If you look a woman who is pregnant and unmarried and shame *her* but not the  father, whoever he is, that is sexist. 

Yes, women being the viable childbearers and men not is not really in anyone's control and you can call it coincidence. But the behaviors that people apply to either sex on account of that "coincidence" is *not* coincidence.  What he's saying is that it's easy to see who the expectant mother is and shame her. You can't tell just by looking at a man that he's an expectant father so how can you shame him? It's not exactly apparent who is going to be the father.  This is more an issue of the treating sex as a religious act than gender based discrimination. If there was a way of detecting men who have premarital sex, religious fanatics would be all over men too. Which they actually sometimes are (example would be priests who don't respect celibate). This is not always true. For example in Ireland(in the past) women who became pregnant out of wedlock were sent to the magdelene laundries. Horrible(catholic) institutions where the women were treated like absolute filth , were abused, were forced to work (laundries) without pay, some were murdered(google it if you feel like a bit of rage). Often times everyone knew the men responsible but NOTHING was done to them, *because men can't control themselves and it's a woman's responsibility to remain pure.* 

It wasn't just women who got pregnant, it was rape victims(as they were now unclean),it was women who were attractive(they were just too tempting for the men), it was women who were convicted of crimes, it was female orphans, women who were mentally disabled(but at the time were just seen as silly girls) and any woman who had pre-marital sex. 

The existence of this place all came from the belief that there was something inherently wrong with girls who were promiscuous. But it was seen that men are just like that. 

Rant over.  I know about this, but this thread (started with a comment ending with "anymore") is about current state. Not 100 years ago.   This reminds me of how Reddit loves single fathers, but hates single mothers.

I had someone arguing with me that of course single fathers are more deserving of praise than single mothers. Abortion clinics are literally everywhere and are totally affordable, and women who don't get them are selfishly inflicting a child upon the poor, choicelss father, who is literally a hero for stepping up to take care of the child in the face of this injustice.

I can't facepalm hard enough. Women have it a lot better in the 1st World, but by no means are they percieved as equal to men nor honoured in our society. 
    I'm suddenly thinking Carlin too.. (say what you will about some of his content.. I generally love George Carlin, gods bless his rotting atheist corpse...)  

.. and about how certain politicians in the US are all about protecting the fetus until it comes out of the vagina.. and then suddenly, pfft! piss off! you're on your own! No food stamps, no welfare, no health care, no education, no child care.. no nothing, you're nothing, until you reach.. Military age! Then oh yes! We can use you then! "They want live babies to become dead soldiers!"  Original sin. 

It's all about purity imho. Virgin is pure, fetus is pure.

Edit: Lest there is any confusion, I don't actually think this way myself. So.. you get knocked up.. you're impure, but you were already, but that purity now goes to.. the fetus.. which then stays pure.. until it takes the trip outside... when it becomes impure? 

Maybe I'm doing mental gymnastics again. Sorry. :/ So.. you get knocked up.. you're impure, but you were already, but that purity now goes to.. the fetus.. which then stays pure.. until it takes the trip outside... when it becomes impure? 

Maybe I'm doing mental gymnastics again. Sorry. :/ I think the idea is life is a gift from god, a gift that is pure, but that somehow isn't once we enjoy it.  &amp;gt;dole bludger

It's always so strange to hear another English-speaking country's slang. right? Americans call it "Welfare queens" (ugh, it's basically only directed at women) right? Americans call it "Welfare queens" (ugh, it's basically only directed at women)  "fuck women" -the government.   So many of the people who claim to be pro-life are actually just pro-birth, once it leaves the vagina, they don't care about it anymore. It's really fucking sick.  Or just plain hypocritical. Like saying you're pro-life, and then supporting capital punishment. Or just plain hypocritical. Like saying you're pro-life, and then supporting capital punishment.   My mom got a lot of the same stuff before I was born.  She said she felt like those people were trying to treat her as an adoption mill.

In that way I guess the anti-abortion, anti-single parenters were morally consistent... i.e. abortion is murder, and single parents are generally horrible people, but its not like single parents should be keeping their children anyways. I deal with shit like that all the time... I just went from being happily married with a one year old son to being a single mom, and you would not BELIEVE the difference in the way people treat you. If there's a man with you, "Awh what a sweet family!" When I'm by myself, "Slut."  I was treated like a slut when I was pregnant. Peers, superiors, strangers ...every one seemed to think that it was my fault I was alone, that the pregnancy was my punishment, and that I was deserving of shame, gossip, and alienation. 

When I moved back to my old community, I was a treated much better. Every one seemed sympathetic and welcoming, and did everything they could to make me feel welcome and prepared for the baby. Surprisingly, these Southern folks are much kinder to my than any of my other peers. 

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. But I remember experiencing exactly the same thing this cartoon woman did. I'm still experiencing some scorn for my single parent status, but it's mostly by strangers who don't know me as a person and a parent.  I see that all the time, pregnant girls are treated like scum. What I don't get is why the men who leave them aren't? A man shirking his role as a father is considered par for the course, and the poor woman left to pick up the pieces and be everything for that child is considered shameful. It's a fucking culture of shame. 
It's not like we just think one day, "Oh! I shall get pregnant today! Yes, good plan." No. A man's penis ejaculated sperm into my egg and it caused me to have a baby. I didn't do this all on my own. I think guys are looked over because they're not as visible as a single woman with a swollen belly and eventually a kid. 

The father doesn't go to the WIC office, he doesn't check out with those bright visible tickets, he doesn't have to continuously miss work and social engagements because the child needs attention. He doesn't get to the end of his rope with his kid and have a meltdown with the baby in public. He doesn't have to console his kid for being picked on because that kid doesn't have a daddy like every one else. *

Unless he makes it public that he abandoned his kid and the mother of his child, he will just be another face in the crowd. 

*I realize single parenthood is a struggle for everyone, regardless of the gender of the parent. But, overall, women are left with the kid while the dad skips town. Single dads (barring death and disaster) have to actively fight for the rights to their kids. So, that's why I focused on single mothers.  True, I get that. I just get so angry thinking about all that, that it's TRUE. That you never see the dad's dealing with their kids like mothers have to. Even when they're still in the picture. When my ex and I were still together, living together, he STILL couldn't take the time out of his busy schedule of playing on his computer and enjoying his "me" time to hold his son for more than five minutes a day. It sickens me. Did we date the same person? I broke off an engagement because I realized I was taking care of two people, and didn't have any time left over to take care of myself.  God, it's a fucking possibility... we're getting a divorce because he fucked the girl across the hall. Who knows who else he was seeing! Maybe not my ex-fianc&#233;, but my daughter's biological dad? 

Don't mess with married folks, folks. It never ends well. I think guys are looked over because they're not as visible as a single woman with a swollen belly and eventually a kid.

The same way that many extremist pro-lifers target women who want an abortion based on rape, but not the rapists themselves. Instead, they imply that women lie about the rape i.e. Todd Akin "If it's a *legitimate* rape...". Basically "We don't care that you had this awful traumatic experience forced upon you, but we think you're making it up and even if you're not, you have to have this baby."  And if that woman isn't the strongest bitch since Joan of Arc, I suspect there could possibly be some feelings of resentment towards that baby, you know? I have seen it happen, unfortunately. And who wants to grow up knowing they're a product of rape?  Right. But if you say that, many of them will retort with "But there's always adoption"

Which, besides the fact that that option still requires you to stay pregnant for nine months and endure labor- HOW many unwanted children do we have floating around in the foster care systems already??? Many people mention overpopulation when arguing for abortion rights, but the foster care thing is my real concern. I drive a school bus and I've transported more than a few foster children. We're not supposed to know about their personal lives, but kids tell you things and they just tug on my heartstrings. There are so many beautiful children in foster care that could use a home, why force some poor woman to carry a baby to full term just to be thrown into that same system? I see that all the time, pregnant girls are treated like scum. What I don't get is why the men who leave them aren't?

I don't know, I don't think I've ever experienced a man being congratulated for abandoning his child. I think they are subject to a good amount of scorn (and rightfully so).

It's just less obvious if a guy has a child somewhere or got a girl pregnant that he abandoned as opposed to a pregnant single woman I just feel (and have seen) that the social stigma is much greater if a woman abandons her child as opposed to a man doing so. I wish there was some way for the fathers to develop the same attachment mothers get with their babies, because I really doubt this would keep happening if they did. Attachment is not strictly limited to mothers. All of my human development studies have essentially said that because mothers typically *are* the sole and primary caregiver, that's why they're usually the attachment figure. Of course, you might say, the mother has biologically granted means that might foster stronger attachment, like breastfeeding, but what if a woman doesn't have mammary glands, or is physically unable to breastfeed for whatever reason? Do they not get a strong attachment to their child? Sure they do. Anyone who gives the child love, care, attention, and *mere presence* is capable of developing a very strong attachment to them.  I think if more men tried to share the role of primary caregiver, they would feel much more attached. Yeah, that's basically what I was trying to say :) I think that men have full capability to be as loving and nurturing of a parent as a woman. It is sexist to say that they don't, but we have these stereotypes that always paint the man as stoic and withdrawn, and it's sad.  I deal with shit like that all the time... I just went from being happily married with a one year old son to being a single mom, and you would not BELIEVE the difference in the way people treat you. If there's a man with you, "Awh what a sweet family!" When I'm by myself, "Slut."  :( \*hugs*  I completely agree with this, but I really wish some of the bubbles in the second picture weren't there. It really bothers me that it says that children without two parents (basically) are more likely to lead a fulfilling life. I myself live with just my mom and it's been like this for 15 years. I have a 4.166 GPA, an honor student, not a druggie or anything near. I'm in a stable, loving, and supportive home. I don't mean to brag, and I'm just trying to defend my case. Go single moms!

The bubbles aren't the truth, they are examples of harassment single mothers face by others. My mother also raised me by herself and she was a kick ass parent but she got shit every day from judgmental douchebags because she had the audacity to leave my piece of shit father. We have nearly the exact situation The final straw was when my dad kept leaving me at age two months home alone so he could go work out at the gym while my mom was in class. He thought my mom was overreacting. Oh my gosh :O I'm happy you're okay. Who knows what would have happened! My father used to play video games with his friends and lock me in a room and smoke marijuana near me when I was an infant. He used to  be violent with my mother and always used to scream and be bossy, rude, and manipulative. I've lost contact with him after he lost his temper the past Christmas. Your dad sounds like my dad, except my mom stayed with him until she caught him having an affair when I was in high school. THAT was the final straw... not him beating me until I blacked out, not blowing pot breath at the baby (me), not him forcing me to drink beer when I was 3 and freaking out when I spat it out, not every time he was violent with her, not the fact he was a manipulative sociopath... nope... cheating. 20 years later. That was the final straw. Really? 

I wasn't raised by a single parent, but I might as well have been. When he wasn't a raging menace, he was out drinking at all hours or away on "business trips"

I'm sorry about Christmas. It's probably best you lost contact with your dad. But you turned out ok! so yay for happy endings!

I grew up with a single mom. Latch-key kid all the way. It is not an ideal method of child rearing. Every study ever done on the issue illustrates that. My life trajectory was quite obviously knocked down a few notches because of it.

But congratulations on doing well *despite* coming from a single parent household. I'm honestly glad I only have one parent in my life. My father is not a good person. I'm sorry you haven't had as many opportunities, but, I guess we just have to let the chips fall where they may. I hope I'm not being too nosy but I have a couple questions for you if you don't mind answering? I am a single mother and I just wanted to know when you realized your dad was not a good person? My daughters father is a violent alcoholic and does not acknowledge her except on Sundays when I visit his mother (at her request). My daughter is only 6 months old right now and I have been very nice with letting her father see her if he is sober (which has been just a handful of times since she was born). I don't plan to talk badly about him to her, I want her to make her decision for herself, I just want to know how long it took you to realize. And also, what is something your mother did that helped with the whole "dad is a bad guy" situation? I hope I'm not being too nosy but I have a couple questions for you if you don't mind answering?

Oh thank you :) Probably sports medicine, or neonatology  Oh thank you :) Probably sports medicine, or neonatology  Hard as it would be when you lose a patient, the world needs more neonatologists.

But thats the point. What the bubbles are saying aren't always the truth, but what people will say. People can lie. There is nothing wrong in coming from a single family home, but the people who argue against them will say that there is something horribly wrong because it supports their views. The idea isn't that these are all true, its just that people will shame others with these points. I understand :) I was just saying what was bothering me in this piece. Ohhhhhh. I get it. I thought you.. yeah... Well now I feel like I put on my sassy pants for nothing...   [deleted]  I'm concerned about children growing up without male role models.

This IS a murder, and while it is very convinient and widely accepted, it is still a murder.

And yes, if you were over 18 and voluntarily having unprotected sex, why should tax payers fund your lifestyle? You knew what you were getting into.

Having abortions can be easily justified, but please don't put it as a random accident that just happened and had nothing to do with you - in the majority of the cases the mother is at fault. Either accept that removing your unborn proginy piece by piece is your choise and your responsibility, and you are OK with that for whatever reason, or carry the consequences of your negligence.

If you didn't wear sunblock but got skin cancer, should we barre you from getting treatment? If you forgot to wear your seatbelt because you were in a hurry and got into a near-death accident should we just let you die? If you were "negligent" and ran over your friend and nearly killed him, leaving him in need of a heart and blood donor, should we legally require you to be the one to give up your organs and blood because "you knew what you were getting into"?

But moreover, I don't know where you get that convenient little figure that the majority of unplanned pregnancies are due to "negligence".  &amp;gt;But moreover, I don't know where you get that convenient little figure that the majority of unplanned pregnancies are due to "negligence".

I said it already, but I'll repeat. I'm from that age group, we did not have any sex ed classes, but if any of my friends told me he doesn't know what condoms are for, I would authomatically assume he/she is joking, because nobody is that fucking retarded. I really can't convey my point without being vulgar. Someone not knowing this stuff is completely out of the question. I don't have any figures, nor did I claim to have any, but statistically there just can't be that many idiots and tragically sheltered students. 

And anyway, I don't know what illusions you have about 18 year olds, but legally they are and should have responsibility for their actions. They are not kids that don't know what they are doing, they are living thinking human beings that have, along with the freedoms, responsibility for their actions. It is that simple.

About that legislation you proposed, it really is not compareable imo, and anyway I never said that there should be no medical help with unplanned pregnancies, I just implied it shouldn't be an exception - either all medical care is paid by the government or the abortions etc are paid by the patient.

Though I agree that people living with risk factors such as obesity, bad driving habits, smoking etc etc should pay more for their medical care.  Gee, that's some impressive evidence you have to back up your claims. But seriously, people believe some crazy shit about sex. Look at Rush Limbaugh, an adult who doesn't understand that you don't take an amount of birth control proportional to how much sex you have. Check out [this article](http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/12/15/sex.report/index.html), which suggests that 28% of men believe that two condoms are better than one, and 18% of men believe that having sex standing up will reduce the chances of pregnancy. One study found that a shocking four in ten people don't believe using birth control has any impact on whether or not you get pregnant. Twenty-seven percent of women and 34 percent of men in one survey said serious health problems such as cancer are highly likely to result from using the pill or other hormonal contraceptives.

I understand that teens will inevitably learn about things like condoms from their peers. But they won't necessarily learn how to put them on in the most effective way. And they'll also learn little myths, like using two condoms is better than one. Considering how catastrophic it can be when teenagers don't understand safe sex practices, and how fucking easy it would be to just give them accurate information about this stuff, I don't know why anyone would just settle for, "oh, I'm sure they all understand it, how dumb could they be?" I'll get downvoted a lot, but both arguments are right.

This IS a murder, and while it is very convinient and widely accepted, it is still a murder.

And yes, if you were over 18 and voluntarily having unprotected sex, why should tax payers fund your lifestyle? You knew what you were getting into.

Having abortions can be easily justified, but please don't put it as a random accident that just happened and had nothing to do with you - in the majority of the cases the mother is at fault. Either accept that removing your unborn proginy piece by piece is your choise and your responsibility, and you are OK with that for whatever reason, or carry the consequences of your negligence. &amp;gt; if you were over 18 and voluntarily having unprotected sex, **SUFFER, HARLOT.** I'll get downvoted a lot, but both arguments are right.

How are these consenting adults supposed to know about the consequences of unprotected sex? Most schools (in the US, at least) aren't required to teach sex ed, so unless parents explain sex and pregnancy, a lot of people are going to grow up not fully understanding sex. There are plenty of people who have sex without "knowing what they're getting into." I don't think the problem is not knowing what the consequences of unprotected sex is.

I think the problem is not knowing or understanding how birth control works: not knowing where to obtain it, not knowing how to put on, or take off, condoms. A misunderstanding of what can and can't make someone pregnant.

Personal example: Until my second year of college I had no idea how to properly use a condom - I knew what they were, and I knew how to get them, but I didn't know how to put them on, and I didn't know there were female condoms. Also, until I was fourteen or fifteen I didn't understand that sperm, semen, and *urine* were different things. I'm fairly positive that this was normal in my group of friends at the time.

There are plenty of people who have sex without "knowing what they're getting into." I didn't have any sex ed classes either. Still, I am 100% sure that there was not ONE person that graduated high school with me that was sheltered or stupid enough to not know where babies come from. 100%. I mean, I know these people, such a blatant lack of knowledge is so ridiculously out of the question...

 Not a retort, just pointing out that its very very rarely the lack of knowledge, and way more often stupidity.

On the debate fertilized eggs = people:
 Even people who believe that fertilized eggs are people are unlikely to say that others [men or non-pregnant women] should be forced to undergo medical procedures that would save another person's life. Should people be legally require to donate blood because it saves another person's life? What about people who are O negative or AB negative? There are shortages of those blood types. Should people with those blood types be legally required to donate? It causes them little to no harm to do so--if they don't, people will die. 
If you happen to be a match for a dyeing person needing a bone marrow transplants should you be legally required to donate? Maybe you even joined a bone marrow registry thinking you would donate. Maybe you even promised to donate, but now don't want to for whatever reason. Should you HAVE to donate because it will save another person's life and won't cause you (that) much bodily harm? Should it be illegal for you not to donate? Why should a woman HAVE to carry a pregnancy to term?
 If you feel that fertilized eggs are people does that mean in the event of fire petri dishes of fertilized eggs should be saved before people?Saving a bunch of petri dishes of fertilized eggs is easy compared to saving a single individual in a fire. These dishes each contain hundreds of "people," so why shouldn't a firefighter save hundreds of "people" before going on to save others one by one?  [deleted] You're missing the point, which is that the people who say these things assign the same blame to the woman regardless of her choice, yet offer nothing in the way of solutions to the problem.

Nothing wrong with having an opinion, just keep your opinion out of my uterus. 

When you force your opinion on to me by making abortion illegal then we have a problem.  [deleted] They can say they have a problem with it but at the end of the day me having an abortion has NO effect on them, they weren't going to raise my child, they weren't going to carry it to term it makes no difference to them whether I have it or not. 

I would also argue that their argument is kind of stupid. It's not life( it's technically a parasite) so it's not really destroying a life, it is however killing a potential life form but so is men masturbating (each sperm is a potential life) or two people having protected sex (again wasting sperm)! I'd also ask them would they support women who had abortions being imprisoned. *After all it is murder*  [deleted] [deleted] I don't think the problem is opinions differing. Plenty of people have opinions different than mine - I don't care. The problem is both of these attitudes are held by people on the conservative side of things - often in the same person. It feels somewhat hypocritical, or at least mean spirited.  [deleted] If your *opinion* makes you more likely to take away my freedoms to my body and my life, then FUCK your opinions.

Will the hormonal IUD give the same problems? I still want BC... but not at such a high emotional cost for me personally... share your experiences?

MORE INFO: I stopped taking it because my boyfriend moved 1000 miles away so I figured I'm pretty safe from being pregnant for now - then we broke up on Valentines day.... so I might be needing it again if I start dating someone else... eventually...

Right now it's either find something better than the pill for me or swear off sex completely because I will not risk becoming pregnant... ahh... womanhood. 

I should also mention that I have extremely painful cramps with each period - one of the only things the pill affected positively - plus I'm 23 never had children so I just imagine IUDs as a crampy nightmare for me... since they make cramps worse and mine are already almost unbearable. I have left lecture halls to curl up in the fetal position and hold back tears - they're that bad. 

So.. should I get an IUD...?  You should definitely sit and talk with your doctor about options. I had a friend who started yazmin and it made her a complete sociopath. 

Your doctor needs to know what you want out of the birth control. There is the patch and other pills that you could experiment with. Its a process of trying what works best. I know that with IUDs they typically want you to have had at least a child because of the complications that could be associated with it. 

I would talk to a pharmacist, a physician, a gynecologist, and someone from planned parenthood. They will all have different suggestions but you will get different sides so as to not feel pressured into taking one specific one.  This is all good info except IUDs are becoming more widely used in childless women though they do have a slightly higher risk of slipping out if place. I really want a Mirena because I hate having to remember to get my pills from the pharmacy and take them and pay for them every month and would infinitely prefer to not have to worry about it so much.

That said, if you want to do something less invasive and less expensive up front, try another type of pill. Tri-Sprintec made me completely depressed and moody and kinda crazy but now I'm on generic Nordette and I'm perfectly fine. Different formulations of the pill affect different individuals very differently, so just because one pill didn't work for you doesn't mean that there's not a pill out there that doesn't have bad side effects. Talk to your doctor about your options and maybe give some other hormonal methods a try. You should definitely sit and talk with your doctor about options.

The thing is I kind of already have talked to those people - plus I'm a nursing student so I'm pretty aware of how everything works. However, it doesn't say much in my textbooks about how fucked up emotionally the Pill would make me feel, however I have seen people write about it on the internet. 

So I guess I'm just wondering if the hormonal IUD makes people feel the same way as the Pill - because there are still 'some' hormones involved. I'm most concerned about not having my personality/emotions changed because of a birth control method and I don't want to go through the trouble to have an IUD put in if I'm just going to feel dead inside again. I want some anecdotal experiences of real women using them before I commit...

And how bad the cramps ACTUALLY are   I had bad emotional reactions to BC pills too. The last one I was on was Yaz and I finally got tired of it and said NO MORE!

My OBGYN suggested the NuvaRing. I was a little against it at first but I had a friend who was on it and loved it do I said I'd test it for a few months.

I love it. Much easier to use, lower dosage of hormones, and I clears my skin up but I haven't gained any weight or noticed any emotional changes. Before jumping into an IUD I'd seriously consider the NuvaRing. 

I sound a bit like a commercial now so I'll tell you the one bad effect from the ring. A few of my friends don't like having it in during sex because their boyfriends can feel it. I personally have not had that problem and my boyfriend doesn't notice it or mind it. But that seems to be the only complaint I've heard about the Ring. Nuva ring still killed my sex drive :(.  Really? That's so crazy. My sex drive, if anything, has gotten higher. But that could be because I'm living with my boyfriend now. I definitely didn't notice any negative impact on it.    Have you heard of the symptothermal method of birth control? It involves tracking your fertility, and it's way more effective than the rhythm/calendar method (98%+ effective when practiced correctly). Two good resources: 1) http://www.amazon.com/Taking-Charge-Your-Fertility-Anniversary/dp/0060881909, 2) http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6375261.stm. I've been using the method (successfully) with my husband for 2 years and love it.

However, at the time, I thought *all* girls had these experiences, and that my behaviors / thoughts were perfectly normal, and all the other straight girls felt this way too. Examples that took place throughout middle and high school:

- Really loving sleepovers with female friends who would choose to sleep in my bed and cuddle with me, rather than requesting a sleeping bag. (I thought I just liked cuddles.)

- Trying really, really hard not to stare at the girls undressing in gym class. (I thought i was just curious about other girls' bodies.)

- Watching lesbian porn and generally acknowledging that I thought boobs were great. (I thought this was a pretty standard all-girls-did-this thing!)

- Having actual *crushes* on girls, like getting butterflies when they texted me, thinking they were really pretty, wanting to be with them all the time. It never occurred to me to think about them sexually though. (I thought I just developed more intense friendships than other people did!)

**Straight women: did things like this happen to you? And if they did, did you ever wonder whether or not you were into girls?**  I mean, I've had all those experiences.  In college, I acknowledged that I am actually attracted to females also, but I definitely prefer men.  I wouldn't say that I was bisexual, but that doesn't mean the right girl couldn't eventually come along. It's not just straight, gay or bisexual, there are definitely attractions to either sex in between.  Maybe not every individual feels that way and most probably identify with an orientation, but I think that people should acknowledge attraction without worrying about it. No one should have to worry about being who he or she is. I think my opinions align with yours. I identify as straight... Except I'm of the opinion (and have been for quite a few years now) that I could easily fall in love with either a male or female. I have no problem with this; it's more that I've never had that kind of connection with a girl, but I am open to it.

I suppose I call myself straight so I have some kind of identity, but I think my sexuality is more up in the air than that. I mean, I love my boyfriend, and I am attracted to men physically, but I don't see that as a barrier to ever being attracted to/falling in love with a girl. I'm only 20, so I suppose this kind of thing might be normal, though. This is me too! I identify as straight because people seem to like it if you fit in a category. 

But really I'm "mostly emotionally attracted to men and 50/50 attracted to both sexes, mostly only had romantic feelings for men but could easily fall in love with the right person, regardless of gender." This is called bisexual but heteromantic.  Its really common.  I'm this way too.  I have sexual feelings toward men and woman and genderqueer people (the whole gender spectrum really) but romantically I've only been interested in men.  I don't see myself as straight though, I've had sex with several woman and I like pussy too damn much to be straight.  

Actually being heteromantic confused me for a long time because I couldn't figure out why I had such strong sexual feelings towards women if I wasn't so interested in them romantically. Aye. I identify as pan-romantic (leaning heteromantic), but homosexual.  How do you manage that if you are more romantically attracted to people you aren't sexually attracted to?  Sorry I'm just curious, I would imagine I would have a hard time if I wasn't actually sexually attracted to the people I'm romantically attracted to.  Luckily I'm sexually attracted to the whole spectrum (I usually go by bisexual since its an umbrella term but pansexual fits me as well) but my romantic attractions are narrower. It's really tough. I was once engaged to a man I only slept with about a dozen times, though we dated for four years, because I am so completely not at all aroused by men's bodies. (I asked him if we could be in an open relationship where I could try being with girls when I moved away to go to graduate school. He was on board, and was very accepting and understanding about the whole thing.)

Before I broke up with my fiance, one of the things I was worried about most was that I'd never find a woman I'd be able to fall in love with the way I have fallen in love with men. Scary! Currently, though, I am dating a wonderful woman in my PhD program (who was also engaged to a man when I met her!), and I couldn't be happier. That's awesome, I feel like it would be much easier being in a romantic relationship with someone you are sexually attracted to.  Polyamory can help even out some of the issues you had with your ex but then again it is not a relationship style that works for everyone.  If your girlfriend still dating the man (i.e. are you guys poly?) or did you decide that both of you would be better in this new relationship.

I'm so happy for you that you have such love in your life. Thanks!

The story with my girlfriend is pretty crazy. I'm really open about being gay in my department and thought everyone knew, but apparently she didn't (we didn't really know each other). A mutual friend casually brought it up in a conversation with her, though, and she was fascinated, and sought me out to have a conversation with me and to tell me that she thought she was bi, but had never been with a girl before. 

The key part of this story, though, is that her boyfriend had just moved several states away for a job, and she was going to join him: by the time we met she had already technically quit the program, relinquished her fellowship, secured a high-paying job, signed the lease with her boyfriend, put all of her stuff into boxes, etc. She was leaving in two weeks.

We became close friends immediately, and had instant chemistry. A few days before her move, she told me that her and her boyfriend had an open relationship, and we hooked up. She realized that she was very-very gay, broke up with her boyfriend, cancelled her move, and re-enrolled in the program.

This was about a year ago. We've been together (monogamously) ever since.  How do you manage that if you are more romantically attracted to people you aren't sexually attracted to?  Sorry I'm just curious, I would imagine I would have a hard time if I wasn't actually sexually attracted to the people I'm romantically attracted to.  Luckily I'm sexually attracted to the whole spectrum (I usually go by bisexual since its an umbrella term but pansexual fits me as well) but my romantic attractions are narrower. It can be really hard, especially if you realize it when you aren't currently with anyone.  I am heteroromantic and homosexual, and I thought that I would never find anyone.  I could have done the poly-mixed bag relationship for a while, but I always wanted one person to grow old with.  I really lucked out finding my partner, and realizing I could be sexually attracted to him. It can be really hard, especially if you realize it when you aren't currently with anyone.

Actually being heteromantic confused me for a long time because I couldn't figure out why I had such strong sexual feelings towards women if I wasn't so interested in them romantically. Oh wow, I'd never heard a term for it before.  I hope that it becomes more popular just so that people don't have to deal with this "confusion".  It's really too bad that the labels we have just confuse people. I think my opinions align with yours. I identify as straight... Except I'm of the opinion (and have been for quite a few years now) that I could easily fall in love with either a male or female.

I'm only 20, so I suppose this kind of thing might be normal, though.  I had my fair share of wonderings while growing up, watching other girls change and being the cliche tomboy but as I got older I realized that I'm into guys. I've done the whole drunk kissing a girl, but nothing. 

However, I have an entertaining story:

A few weeks ago, after smoking a little pot, I had a few minute thought process of "What if I'm gay? I've never *tried* anything with another female before! So how do I *really* know? Oh man, I'm probably a lesbian and now I have to break up with my boyfriend and tell my parents? I'm too *old* to discover I'm a lesbian!"


Shortly followed by "Oh yeah, I'm straight." 
  [deleted] &amp;gt;The idea of touching someone else's vagina doesn't appeal to me. At all. I acknowledge that I am attracted to other women, but not so much that I want to have sex with them.

This.  I was always curious about other girls changing.  I enjoyed sleepovers probably a little more than I should.  There was even one extremely weird night where my best friend and I played a game where we were in the dark and one of us had a flashlight.  When the light went off, we scissored and wiggled around, when the light came on, we stopped.  Of course that sounds super duper lesbian-ish, but thinking back, I really just think it was because we were around that age where you've discovered masturbation (sometime around middle school) and it was just an extension of that.  It makes me cringe thinking about it, but it was way more innocent that it probably sounds.

I think women are beautiful and they can most certainly turn me on...  I've thought about how maybe I'm bisexual and just haven't realized it yet.  (Couldn't be full gay... I like the D too much)  But then I think about what I would do if I were ever in a sexual encounter with another woman... And I realized I don't want my face or hands near anyone's lady parts.         Uuuhh, I STILL have those experiences and I'm 24. I am pretty certain I would never carry out a relationship with a woman, but I frequently check other women out. I think I check out women more than men. No, I'm cetain of it. Wtf is up with that? I see some women and think "God I would like to lay my head down on her chest/thighs/perfect stomach." Its a totally physical thing though. I don't have any romantic aspirations towards women, even the ones I find attractive.  One time in the halls of high school, thinking absently about gay rights etc.  I put myself in the mind of a gay guy, and what it would be like to be with 'another' guy.  For thirty seconds, I couldn't make any progress.  Nobody looked attractive, and it kind of left my mind.  I started thinking about classes.  Then a guy caught my eye, and I thought "Oh my god!  I'm attracted to men!  I'm GAY!"  and then I remembered  I was not a guy, but a girl, and that since I was a girl I was in fact, still straight.  Gotta say, I felt really stupid :P I feel guilty for laughing at you, but thank you for having the courage to share, because this *completely* cracked me up.  I consider myself to be as heterosexual as a woman can get.  I never really liked cuddling with girls b/c I hated how soft they were, and ugh boobs are the softest of all. 

I would have a hard time not staring at girls when they were changing though, but it was just because I was fascinated by how different everyone was.  I was the only non-white girl of all of my friends and in almost all my classes, so I thought white girls were fascinating. Like how their bruises turned green, how hairless they all were, or how pale their skin could get.

I thought, and still do think, that girls are very pretty and I like to just stare at a really beautiful woman's face/figure, but in the way that I would look at a work of art, not a sexual being.  I was a very late bloomer (didn't think a boy was cute until ~15 years old), so I thought this meant that I was bi, but turns out I'm definitely not haha    In my experience with my girlfriends and with my female friends the most important determining factor in determining whether or not a woman is into girls is how she feels about [vagina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n39RzgVNP8) It's true. When I first kissed a girl, I realized I leaned strongly towards a preference for women. It wasn't until I first went down on a girl I realized I was really, really, really, really gay. I was never able to convince myself to give any of my previous boyfriends head for more than a few seconds at a time; I could go down on women indefinitely, and it's one of my favorite parts of sex.    I'm a teenager and I've kissed girls and had sex with a boy but the thought of me possibly being with a girl does turn me on. I'm really confused because i did enjoy having sex with him but girls are just really interesting to me. I guess I'm just bisexual     &amp;gt;and that my behaviors / thoughts were perfectly normal

They were and they still stand as "normal", as in OK; fine; no problem. I get your point though.    I have an aesthetic appreciation for women's bodies, and yes I agree that boobs are pretty amazing. But, what made me realize that I'm not lesbian or bi is that I am definitely not attracted to the idea of touching another woman's vagina.  Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, I just don't have any desire to do so. Pretty sure that's the gold standard for knowing you aren't straight.  I know I love eating pussy too much to be straight.  A friend of mine whom identifies herself as "bisexual" came to the sudden realization that she might be attracted to women when she was surrounded by a small group of her closest female friends while traveling for a year at a gay bar that the taxi driver happen to drop them off by.      </snippet></document><document><title>I got an IUD a while back, but my period randomly stopped.

Over winter break (about 2 months ago) I had unprotected sex once or twice (most of the time we used condoms), and then I left for college again. It's been at least a month since I last had my period, and I honestly can't remember if I've had my period since I last had sex. I thought I had, but now that I think back, I'm not sure. My friend says she doubts I'm pregnant, especially since I have an IUD. Is it possible that my period just decided to stop because of the effects of the IUD, or is there a high possibility that I'm pregnant? I don't feel like I am, and I haven't had any symptoms, but the sudden lack of period is still worrisome.

Thanks in advance.  Yeah, IUD's often stop periods. I haven't had a period in several months- I do a pregnancy test about every two months to make sure I'm not doomed, but it's always negative. It's worth the peace of mind.  Yeah, IUD's often stop periods.

It sounds like they put an IUD in without giving you proper information about it. They should have told you that it's common for people to just stop getting their period with an IUD. About 1 in 5 people does. it's really nothing to worry about.  Chances are good that Mirena has caused your periods to stop.  It's a pretty common side effect.

I found it helpful for peace of mind to test regularly when I didn't get a period.  It's very unlikely that you'll find yourself pregnant, but just checking once/month means that you don't have to worry about it.  I haven't had a period in almost 5 years due to IUD. It is highly likely this is the reason why. However, wouldn't hurt to do a pregnancy test. Get one from the chemist/drug store. If it's been about 2 months would a drugstore pregnancy test suffice?

Also, thank you :)</snippet></document><document><title>Feeling pretty crushed and I really don't know where to go from here with my SO.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/192sjy/feeling_pretty_crushed_and_i_really_dont_know/</url><snippet>We've been together for a few months now and are happy out with one another. Like everyone we have small arguments over silly things but they never last long and we always make up.

Last night we were at his friends place, had a few drinks, a bit of a dance, when we got back to my SO's place I was "in the mood", he was not. I was a little tipsy and can't remember exactly what we said but something about him "having a few issues" came up, so I started to ask him what it was and wanted to talk about it then and there, he said to leave it, that we were both drunk and it would only start a fight and he'd talk to me in the morning.

So this morning we wake up, we're having cuddles and chats, the usual, I ask him what he was talking about last night, he tells me that he's noticed I've put on some weight, and while he loves me and "it doesn't matter" he can't help thinking "how much hotter" I'd be if I were a bit skinnier.

He said all the things your supposed to say in the situation - let's do some sports together, this is not something I'll break up with you over, I still love you, blah blah blah.

All I heard was "You're not skinny enough, you're not skinny enough, you're not skinny enough".

He went out to get milk for breakfast, I had a shower (after having a little cry in bed first). After the shower I took a deep breath and looked at myself in the mirror...

I think I look just fine.

Sure I've a little bit of a tummy, and it would be nice to have Beyonce's thighs - but I know what's involved in achieving that and I'm not willing to sacrifice my mini dairy milk with my cup of tea just to make a man happy.

I don't feel like I've put on weight - when I look in the mirror before nights out or whatever I'm happy enough. My clothes still fit me, they haven't started feeling tighter or anything.

So I'm starting to think I've got some form of body dysmorphia where I think I'm skinnier than I actually am, or he's secretely always wanted me to be thinner and felt it was OK to bring it up now.

I just... I don't know how to be around him now. I love fashion and clothes and always make an effort to dress well and look good. I especially fret over what to wear on dates with him because he hates floral and basically everything I own is floral... Now with this thrown in I'm going to be extra stressed about how I look and I'm always going to wonder about it when I'm with him.

Not to mention getting naked for sexy-time.

He's gone wake boarding with some of his friends this afternoon, he invited me to go with him and I was like "yeah, I don't really feel like wearing a bikini around you right now" he said "no no, it doesn't change anything" I was like "yeah, well, that's easy for you to say".

So ladies... What do I do in this situation?

Oh and just FYI - I'm a UK dress size 10, depending on the shop occasionally I'm an 8, I don't really have an active life so I'm not toned in any way but I certainly wouldn't call myself fat. I eat pretty healthy, good balance of fruit and veg etc, but yes, I have a sweet tooth and enjoy a cheeky bite of chocolate/crisps here and there but not anything excessive (I don't think anyway), so this really isn't an issue of health because I am healthy(ish).

**TL;DR** SO wants me to lose weight, I don't think I need to (beyond sometimes wishing I had a flat tummy etc etc), I'm a UK 10 (sometimes 8 - shop depending) and in general healthy and happy with how I look. 

This has crushed me as I'm paranoid about getting naked with him/just being around him in future.

How do I handle this?

**UPDATE**

So I told my friends about it when I got home, they were all in shock. Said a) how out of character it is for him to say something like that and b) how ridiculous it is because I don't actually need to lose weight. They actually started laughing when I told them.

He texted, apologised for being a dick and invited me out for dinner. I borrowed something fabulous from one of my friends (the point had to be proven). He picked me up we went to a nice restaurant. Ordered our food, we started talking about it, he kept talking about "this problem" so I said that I didn't think I have a problem and asked if he thinks I have a problem. I then asked him what "the problem" is - he said "Sometimes when you stand up... Do you really want me to tell you this." - So hurt and angry I walked out of the restaurant. 

Probably OTT but I just didn't feel like sitting down and eating with him while he's telling me he has a problem with my body when there is no problem.

I shook in the taxi all the way home, thinking that was it (he's just as stubborn as I am). He called asked if he could come over to talk, so we talked.

Basically he has his own issues with his body and his eating, I told him that's cool, do what you gotta do but don't project your shit onto me. He said he wanted me to do some activities with him, I told him that yesterday when I suggested going cycling by the beach he shot down the idea... So there's another track he wanted us to cycling on so I said, so you suggest going cycling together some evening or afternoon, I'll say yes as that's a fun activity we're doing together, you don't suggest it as "you need to lose weight so lets go cycling" - English is not his first language so once I pointed that out he had a "ooooohhhhh" moment.

We talked some more and we've agreed that unless there's a serious health issue he should just avoid talking about my weight with me.

For those of you saying to leave him etc - Don't worry, I'm a big girl, I know what I'm doing, this is the first time he's done/said something like this. It is seriously out of character for him, we're going to continue on but trust me, I'm not a weak person.

**TL:DR**

He took me out to dinner to apologise/talk, dug the hole deeper so I left the restaurant. He came over. We talked. Things are good. It's going to take a little while for me to feel comfortable around him again, but I'm sure we'll get there.

Thanks for all your comments and words of advice/wisdom. Once again proving how great this subreddit is!

  If your clothes feel the same and you don't think you've put on weight, then it sounds like something that's been bothering him all along :/ a UK size ten is not big at all unless you are very short, so it sounds like he has unrealistic expectations, and if you're happy with your body that's all that matters. You might consider taking up an active hobby, but only if you want to do it for other reasons too.

I'm sorry that I can't offer any better advice than it sounds like you're not very compatible with each other.   The best thing about this whole post was how happy you are with yourself.  Thats the attitude all of us should be able to achieve in life.  As long as your health is in order, you can *look* however you want to look.  Since you are asking how to handle this, here is what I would do:  I would tell him what you told us.  Tell him you are happy with how you look and as long as you are healthy and *feel* good, then you aren't going to make huge changes to get really trim.  If times in your life involve more exercise or less and you lose or gain weight, it won't matter to you in the long run.  If it matters very much to him, then he needs to re-think the relationship and how he sees the long run.

A couple of things you may not want to hear:

-Just as you are entitled to be happy with yourself (as you should be), he is entitled to tell you what he does and doesn't find sexually attractive.  Be careful not to defend anything but yourself and your choices.  No one *has* to like a certain body type.  

-A little dairy milk (chocolate bar in the UK, right?) and a cup of tea a day doesn't make someone overweight.  I don't even really think you are overweight, thats not what I'm saying.  What I am saying is that "one brownie never made anyone fat."  Its the consistent poor eating over a long period of time that causes weight gain.  I lost 40 lbs one time not giving up daily chocolate.  I just cut portions, practiced moderation, and I was still able to enjoy chocolate.  The problem I see regularly is that I don't think people realize just how much you can cut your eating.  We are always in a frenzy about "starvation mode" but I remember eating very small portions, against everything I believed about food (I was convinced I was starving myself at one point) then I put it all in a calorie counter and I was eating 1400 calories a day.  For my height, that is more than enough.  (disclaimer for anyone wanting to jump on this: if you have some problem that causes weight loss to be especially difficult, then go your own method for health.  This is one real life example I'm giving that I have experienced as have many friends of mine).

-My last point is relatively moot because you stated you are happy with yourself.  But if ever you do want to "lose weight" or simply be trimmer, just know that giving up chocolate is not a necessary.

Lastly, as you grow up (and the guys around you grow up) many of them will value MUCH more than a little belly.  I don't have a perfect body and I have been able to find very loving and fulfilling relationship (including very sexual ones).  So maybe this particular guy isn't the one who you will end up with in the long run.  My current bf has been with me through weight loss and gain and has always had sex with me.  I think he likes something more than my body.  And if thats what you want in life, you will be able to find a relationship that doesn't give a shit at all about a belly.  

 I'm in my mid 20s and this is the first "grown up" relationship I've had.

This is why I was so shocked about him saying this in the first place. I mean, he reassured me that he still loves me and my weight won't change that, it still made me feel like shit.

I know that eating a bit of chocolate (or not) here and there won't make a difference to weight - I was just trying to convey the message that a) I am happy with how I am and also b) If I do decide I want to get fitter, lose weight, tone up, it's going to be because I want to do it, not because someone else has told me I should. (unless it's a serious health issue in which case, obviously I'll listen, but I don't have any health problems).  "he hates floral"

Whats a weirdly specific thing to hate.  I have never in my life thought it was necessary to dictate what I want a girlfriend to wear.  The only exception would be letting her know if a get together was formal, casual, or whatever.

 It could be residual hatred from an ex who wore a lot of floral. I feel that way about the color red; I never liked red very much to begin with, but then I dated a horrible person who used red for *everything* because it was his absolute *favorite*, and now I can't stand the color. Please don't take this as an insult, but that doesn't seem very balanced.  Do you think therapy would help?

I just could never see myself telling a SO that she wasn't allowed or that I preferred that she didn't wear red/floral/whatever.

It seems very controlling.  It seems like OP is walking on eggshells when it comes to her looks.  I'm not suggesting that she needs to dump him, but she needs the confidence to confront him on this in my humble opinion, because that is just no way to live. Oh, no; you're right, he shouldn't be telling her what to wear. The impression I got from OP is that she just knows he doesn't like the floral patterns for whatever reason and because of that tends to avoid wearing them around him. It's a pretty reasonable thing to do for someone you care about - like not playing a song you like but that reminds them of something unpleasant.

Therapy probably would help me, but I'm not rich or famous. My ex was abusive, I'm over it, but I still hate him, and his stupid color. I'm not like... freaking out about it every time I see something red, though. "he hates floral"

Whats a weirdly specific thing to hate.  I have never in my life thought it was necessary to dictate what I want a girlfriend to wear.  The only exception would be letting her know if a get together was formal, casual, or whatever.

 As I said, everything I own is floral (well, a lot of it).

Once or twice I've asked him what he's thought about my dresses/tops etc and he's said he doesn't really like floral as it reminds him of his granny's curtains from home.

Fair enough, I understand, I wear my florals on my own time and wear differen't stuff around him, it's not big deal, it's not changing who I am or anything, sometimes I still wear floral with him, just because I want to. Have you started to understand yet that this guy loves you, but doesn't find you good enough in just about any way? It's his issue, not yours, but the issue is still there.

This relationship is NOT going to work. Yes. Yes yes yes. He is cutting OP down, killing her confidence, step by step. First what she wears, now her body itself, next may be her friends (who tell her he's crazy) are fat too and by the way, why hang out with them so much, since they're bad influences?  Yes.

I've done that and gotten a similar reaction from my SO about things like lipstick (he hates it) and different cuts of dresses. And then I still wear them because *I* love them and he doesn't comment on them unless I ask other than to say, "You look pretty tonight," even if I'm wearing lipstick.

So rule of thumb: Don't even ask if you don't want to know, and when you do know, wear it anyway because why not? And if it's a major issue for him, then he can just get over it. I mean, I stay away from lipstick when we're going on special occasion dates, like anniversary or his birthday or whatever, but when we're just going out like usual, I wear it if I feel like it.

I say that because I can't tell if he was answering you honestly or trying to be controlling, because I wasn't there and don't know context. But even if he's just being honest, he's dating you and with that comes your love of floral prints and your personal style and you shouldn't feel like you have to give any of that up or cut down on it just because he doesn't love it. Just be careful with this and judge for yourself what his goals are, and don't feel obligated to put up with any bullshit you don't want to. That includes this whole weight-loss/getting in shape thing, which sounds like a decently reasonable statement and preference of his that was poorly worded, but just because it's fairly reasonable for him to be more attracted to more fit women doesn't mean that you have any obligation to become more fit.    He's not going to be sexually attracted to you until you drop some weight. 

You feel fine the way you are.  

You haven't been together very long, so maybe it's time to reassess how **you** feel about **him**.  

To me, it seems like he is an undeserving shallow ass at worst.  What is the best case scenario here? I don't know that I'd say it's shallow or undeserving to want or need to be attracted to someone to date them. That said, if he's not attracted to her and she hasn't changed physically since they got together, then he's definitely an ass or ignorant of how relationships work for starting a romantic relationship with someone he wasn't attracted to in the first place.

Attraction is important, and no one can make themselves be attracted to someone. If I put on a significant amount of weight just because I wasn't exercising or eating right or whatever, I would want my SO to be honest with me if it meant he wasn't attracted to me anymore because that is part of being in a relationship. But it's also fine to be happy with your body anyway and unwilling to put in the extra effort, and it's ok for that to end up being a deal breaker, because it will affect your sex life and, depending on how important that is to you, that could end the relationship. 

And that's ok, even if it's a little shallow, because we acknowledge that sexual incompatibility is reason enough for a relationship to fail, and this is just like it. If one person is attracted to the other but the other isn't attracted back, then it's going to be a lot like having mismatched sex drives, even if your general libidos are about the same. I don't think it's shallow or if it is it's benignly shallow. 

A coworker of mine who is around 300 pounds only dates guys who are cut like Ryan Gosling. That's all she is attracted to. She gets upset when guys don't like her because she's "fluffy" but she doesn't like "fluffy" guys either. 

You like what you like.   That was a jerk thing of him to say and do. It would be like you refusing to sleep with him because he didn't have six pack abs. 

Sure, he has every right to his likes and dislikes, but in this case he's just being very shallow and mean. 

Reevaluate this guy. Has he done other negative things like this to you?  &amp;gt;It would be like you refusing to sleep with him because he didn't have six pack abs.

It doesn't sound like he's asking for her to have a six pack. Just be a little more in shape, she admits to not being in any type of good shape other than being happy with the way she looks. That's fantastic, but I don't think it's asking too much to request that your SO stay in decent shape. If that's not something she wants to do then I have no problem with her leaving him. But, I'm not going to demonize him for wanting that either. No, it's not wrong to want your SO to stay in shape. But sounds like OP and her boyfriend have different standards of what "in shape" is. A UK 10 is not very large at all. 

If OP is being honest with us and hasn't changed in shape at all or changed only a very small amount, then this is very odd. From what she says she hasn't even changed clothing sizes, this says to me that if she's gained any weight it would be very minimal (5 pounds or so). It's reasonable to notice but to lose attraction after 5 pounds sounds like there's something else going on to me.  Honestly, it's probably some other issue. I've had exes that I stopped being attracted to. It had nothing to do with their looks. It's easy to blame weight in a situation where it's hard to pinpoint why you're not attracted to someone. OP might be in a situation like that.

Or, maybe he wasn't attracted to her to begin with. He might have thought that over time the attraction would develop. Now that it hasn't he's trying to address it. He had three options. 

* Option 1 - Become attracted to her. This is incredibly difficult to do if you're not already attracted to the person. 

* Option 2 - Talk to her about his attraction issues. This is what he's done. And, now she feels like shit.

* Option 3 - Break up with her. If he did this, then OP would want to know why. The reason would be that he's not attracted to her. Is this better than Option 2? After talking to him this evening this isn't the case.

He told me that I'm basically the most important thing in his world right now.

Like I said in my update, he has his own issues with his weight and his diet. I think he's super attractive as he is but if he feels he wants to diet or whatever, that's just fine. I think he was trying to project his insecurities onto me. Honestly, it's probably some other issue. I've had exes that I stopped being attracted to. It had nothing to do with their looks.

She doesn't sound healthy - she said she doesn't work out. Just because you fit into a certain size doesn't mean you're healthy. The issue in this situation isn't health, it's OP's boyfriend thinking she could be "so much hotter." Who cares what size she is? She doesn't sound healthy - she said she doesn't work out. Just because you fit into a certain size doesn't mean you're healthy. She doesn't sound healthy??? Where did you get this idea from? &amp;gt; I don't really have an active life so I'm not toned in any way but I certainly wouldn't call myself fat.

By "toned" she means, having muscle. And if she's not doing any weight training or cardio, that's not healthy, no matter what size you are. People are meant to move! Start focusing on that and not feeling good about fitting into some arbitrary dress size. &amp;gt; And if she's not doing any weight training or cardio, that's not healthy

Citation please.

One does not have to go to the gym to be healthy. There's plenty healthy people who don't. Who cares what size she is? She doesn't sound healthy - she said she doesn't work out. Just because you fit into a certain size doesn't mean you're healthy. I certainly don't care what size she is. I'm just saying, if she's ok with her lifestyle and doesn't want to change it, then she and her boyfriend probably have differing ideas of what "in shape" means. 

She's certainly not some poster-child for healthiest person in the world, but sounds like she does a lot better than many people.  &amp;gt;she and her boyfriend probably have differing ideas of what "in shape" means.

True, this is the central issue here. 

&amp;gt;sounds like she does a lot better than many people.

Well that's what's wrong - people think they're doing pretty good because they're "not that large" or whatever. I think if you're not [doing the minimum recommended](http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html) amount of exercise, you're not "in shape". Sorry. &amp;gt;It would be like you refusing to sleep with him because he didn't have six pack abs.

It doesn't sound like he's asking for her to have a six pack. Just be a little more in shape, she admits to not being in any type of good shape other than being happy with the way she looks.

Her boyfriend is being unreasonable.  &amp;gt;OP has described herself and she already is in decent shape. Her boyfriend is being unreasonable.

She describes herself as being in a shape that she's happy with.

&amp;gt;I don't really have an active life so I'm not toned in any way but I certainly wouldn't call myself fat.

This is all we know. We have no idea what she looks like now or what she looked like before. If she's happy with herself then great, but he's allowed to not be attracted to her. She can leave if she wants, just like he can. burentu posted [this pic](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_layi2wyP4I1qcl5svo1_r1_500.jpg) below and OP said she's a bit smaller than that. And that means she's in perfectly good shape so her boyfriend is being absolutely unreasonable.  &amp;gt;And that means she's in perfectly good shape so her boyfriend is being absolutely unreasonable.

No. It means that you think she's in perfectly good shape. Your definition of "good shape" and OP's boyfriend's are apparently different. We all have different definitions of what's attractive. Someone from r/fitness is going to have a different definition of "good shape" than r/oreos.

Is she healthy, probably. I have no idea. But, that has no bearing on what OP's boyfriend finds attractive, or his definition of "good shape". Ok, let's split hairs. *My* definition of good shape, along with OP, is reasonable. Her boyfriend's definition of good shape is unreasonable, because that photo is of a person in good health and in good shape. If he wants her to be thinner, he wants her to be underweight and unhealthy. So yeah. He's being unreasonable and so are you.  No, you're trying to force your definition of what's attractive on someone else. I'm defending a guy's right to define what he finds attractive.

&amp;gt;If he wants her to be thinner, he wants her to be underweight and unhealthy.

You can be thinner than that picture and still be perfectly healthy. I think many women would take offense to the idea that only someone that size or larger is healthy. The boyfriend is the one trying to force his definition of attractive onto OP. OP is happy with her body as it is. He's being controlling and unreasonable. 

The fact that you have no problem with the boyfriend behaving in a body-shaming manipulative and controlling way is a little disturbing. The boyfriend is the one trying to force his definition of attractive onto OP. OP is happy with her body as it is. He's being controlling and unreasonable. 

The fact that you have no problem with the boyfriend behaving in a body-shaming manipulative and controlling way is a little disturbing.   Loose him, there are plenty of people out there who will appreciate you for what you are. If he was really worth keeping around he would have gotten you into a physical hobby with him instead of taking a verbal dump. It sounds like he was trying to get her to do a physical hobby together but she isn't interested. It sounds like he was trying to get her to do a physical hobby together but she isn't interested. It sounds like he was trying to get her to do a physical hobby together but she isn't interested. After speaking to him again this evening, it turns out that this is what he was trying to get at.

The thing is we were hanging out yesterday and I suggested going for a walk/cycle by the beach and he had no interest in it.

Then this evening he's like 'let's go to the gym together', I explained to him that if he wanted me to do something with him he should just suggest that and leave my weight out of it. 

Like I said, I'm a healthy normal size. The only thing that sometimes bothers me is that I'm not as toned as I'd like but I'm happy overall. And he is too... sort of.  When it comes to your body, your first and foremost consideration should be your health.  Set aside your boyfriend for a moment, and set aside your own mental conception about the *shape* of your body for a moment.  Now think about your lifestyle, and try to do it objectively: How is your mental/emotional health? How is your diet? How is your activity level?  If you are satisfied with the answers to those questions - and from your post it sounds like you are - then *awesome*. You're set.  Love your body and don't change a thing.

If you're not satisfied with the answers, then put some work into trying to do a bit better.  But don't do it because it will make you thin, or attractive, or because your boyfriend wants you to.... do it for your own health.

Your boyfriend fucked up by focusing on his sexual attraction to your body rather than how healthy your body is. He *super* fucked up by telling you that straight out.  Any dude over the age of about twelve realizes how hurtful it is to say "you'd be hotter if you were thinner".  I'm wondering if there is something else going on here.  Could it be that he specifically wanted to hurt you?  Or is he honestly that naive and/or socially inept that he thought that was an acceptable way to phrase his thoughts?

Is [This](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_layi2wyP4I1qcl5svo1_r1_500.jpg) about a UK 10? I would say that's about right, maybe a bit smaller actually. In that case he has bad taste, is just a sadistic bastard, Or he has other problems with the relationship/outside the relationship and doesn't know what.  Ok, this is a hugely sensitive and person issue. It's a very hard one to approach for SO's without them sounding like a total superficial jerk to you. But, i don't think he meant it that way (although it sounds like the words he chose could have been better. I mean, saying " you could be a lot hotter if you were skinner" just sounds a bit demeaning). He just wants you to be healthy, and he wants to be with you, and continue to feel attracted to you.  I think it's important for BOTH partners in a relationship to put in effort in how they look for each other. I always tell my BF to let me know when I start to look chunky, let me know If I need to work out more etc. I do the same for him. It hurts to hear someone tell you that your body isn't "good enough" but the state of your body isn't static. If you WANT to you can change your physique with healthy eating and exercise. Looking good for you partner isn't just about their pleasure, it's for you too! You'll be happy because you'll be pleased with yourself when you look in the mirror, working out gives you endorphines, you'll have more sex, he'll complement you, it's  win all around! 

Anyway, i'm not trying to defend him. I'm just giving you another prospective on the issue, as I'm very open with having my BF tell me I should lay off the frappucino's a bit. 

Oh yes, and remember i'm not trying to tell you to change for him. Or change because your body is not up to some arbitrary, socially constructed norm. Change if YOU want to and you see a need. Be happy and be healthy. It sounds like you're just fine with the way your body is, so if that suites you then great! Just be healthy and happy.  She's a US Size 6, I'd say that's pretty damn healthy.  &amp;gt;Basically he has his own issues with his body and his eating, I told him that's cool, do what you gotta do but don't project your shit onto me. He said he wanted me to do some activities with him, I told him that yesterday when I suggested going cycling by the beach he shot down the idea... So there's another track he wanted us to cycling on so I said, so you suggest going cycling together some evening or afternoon, I'll say yes as that's a fun activity we're doing together, you don't suggest it as "you need to lose weight so lets go cycling"

He finally figured out that he needed to take the roundabout approach to this. He probably talked to his guy friends and they explained to him that you never bring up a girl's weight. All you can do is encourage her to be active and hope she doesn't take offense. It works best if you can frame is as your own problem and ask her to help you with it.

It's amazing to me that people see what he's doing as a negative thing. He shared his honest opinion and you cried and stormed off. How is this not controlling? It is a negative thing when what he expects her to change into is not what she wants or currently is. He went into this relationship with her at her current weight. Now he says he doesn't find her as attractive as he would if she were thinner. The answer is not to make OP change or doubt herself, it's to find someone who fits his ideals to begin with.

Today when I went in for my woman's wellness check up, she asked if I have been performing monthly breast exams, to which I replied no, since I had never honestly really thought about it. So my doctor began to demonstrate how I should do them, and she found a lump.

She told me that she was extremely sure it was a fibroadenema, which is very common in women in their 20s, and it is not cancerous. It felt smooth and oval-shaped, and could easily move around within the breast tissue (not free floating though, haha). To me it merely felt like when you have a swollen lymph node, and you can sort of "roll" it between your fingers.

Before my appointment was over she said that despite her being sure that it was a fibroadenema, she would give me a referral for an ultrasound and a mammogram. This is what freaked me out.

My mind started racing with what-ifs, and I'm already dreading the wait for my test results after my ultrasound and mammogram. Before I knew what was happening I was in tears in front of the doctor. I mean what the fuck is that? I've always considered myself a rational person who can keep their emotions in check. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for by posting this, but I guess I just don't want to express my fear to my mom or my boyfriend because I don't want to worry them. My doctor reassured me how doubtful she was that the lump was a cancerous tumor, but my asshole brain won't stop milling the possibilities. I have midterms next week, I can't be thinking about this crap! :(  my doctor said that I have dense breast tissue.  translation:  They will stay perky for a long time but will have lots of 'false alarms' when it comes to breast lumps.  Lots of women find lumps that are totally not cancerous.  Know that it probably isn't cancer and if it is, breast cancer is very survivable particularly if you catch it early and are diligent with looking for lumps My mom even said she had a lump she needed to get checked out a couple years ago that ended up being totally fine. I guess I'm just psyching myself out. It's just weird because I don't even have a diagnosis yet and suddenly I'm seeing my entire life through a different perspective. 

As for your "false alarms," have you had them often? That would be such a bitch. I'd probably freak out every single time.       </snippet></document><document><title>The Nu Project</title><url>http://thenuproject.com/about-the-project/</url><snippet>   First, reiterating that this is NSFW.

The advantage of being apart is that our get-togethers are always planned well in advance. He prefers its bare down there and I don't mind, cause I used to shave it all like once a month or so, just out of personal preference. I got a wax for when I visited for an extended amount of time, but that's just not financially realistic to maintain.

Any tips ladies?   You may want to get over being silky smooth down there all the time. It will get very irritating trying to keep it so now that you and your SO will have a lot more time together. I don't think he will mind if it's a little fuzzy or anything :) I wouldn't be so worried if *fuzzy* was my other option, but unfortunately it takes several weeks to get past cactus-like prickly :/ I do a dry trim with nail scissors, as short as I can get whilst keeping it fuzzy not prickly.

Sooooo basically I'm selfishly commenting to use this thread for my own purposes later.


P.S. Congrats on the end of the LDR! It's terribly exciting!  I wouldn't bother with shaving - way too much effort, and it gives me all kinds of spots, redness, etc. I jumped on the sugaring bandwagon and haven't looked back - I go every six weeks (ish) and it is wonderful.

How to connect to my "peers"?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1949ru/moving_to_a_college_town_soon_how_to_connect_to/</url><snippet>19/f, going to be moving in with my boyfriend to a nearby college town soon. Straight out of high school, I decided to enroll in a year and a half long cosmetology program, as opposed to traditional college. I've since graduated my program and gotten licensed, so now I'm trying to find a job so I can feel secure moving in with my boyfriend.

The thing is, I can't help but feel this horrible anxiety while walking around the town, and on campus. I know the people surrounding me are supposed to be my peers, but I feel like since I decided to go to my program, instead of traditional college, I "don't belong". There's also the stigma of "girls who go to beauty school are dumb" that I feel I have to deal with. I know this is ridiculous, but I can't get it out of my head. I feel like I'm in this weird limbo area... 

I'm introverted, with a smidge of shyness around meeting new people, so it's hard for me to be really social and just see all these new people as new opportunities. I'm short (5') and look pretty young for my age, which makes me feel like people don't take me seriously, or just generally see me as a kid (this is a big insecurity of mine). I also have flaming red hair, so that doesn't really help me blend in anymore...

I guess my real question is, **how do I stop feeling insecure/anxious around people who are supposed to be my peers?** And once I get over that, **how do I start meeting new people in town** so I don't become a complete shut-in?   </snippet></document><document><title>Pregnant and falling for the embryo's father- how do I put my emotional guard up?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1932qy/pregnant_and_falling_for_the_embryos_father_how/</url><snippet>So I'm only a few weeks along, and I've scheduled an abortion for a week from now, so this isn't one of those "aahh I'm prego and I don't know what to do!" posts (just to clear things up).  The guy involved and I were in a ~6 month relationship that ended 9 months ago, and we recently started hooking up.  We are basically very close friends who get physical.  No labels whatsoever. 

I just told him about the situation, and he's being wonderful about the whole thing.  He fully supports my decision, and insists on paying for absolutely everything involved in the process (I suggested splitting 50/50, but he won't agree to it).  He wants to spend lots of time with me, and suggested "watching movies and cuddling" later this afternoon.  I know he's just being supportive, but I can't help but fall for him all over again.  It's probably just the hormones and the situation, but he's just being so wonderful.  He wants to come to the clinic with me, everything.  

I really need to have my emotional guard up.  I highly doubt anything happen between us after this, and I don't want to be heartbroken over him again.  What do I do?


TL;DR: Newly pregnant, baby daddy is being extremely supportive, there's some history between us, I'm falling for him but want to stop.  What should I do?   I think you need to clarify what he wants and expects from you. Although you were just physical without labels, it seems clear from his behavior that he wants a relationship. 

And, unfortunately, at this time that might not be the greatest idea. Some people don't have any problems getting an abortion, but for others it's stressful and they need time to heal both physically and mentally. I would suggest some distance.         </snippet></document><document><title>Feeling...threatened (?) when a guy's "type" is older women.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19497l/feelingthreatened_when_a_guys_type_is_older_women/</url><snippet>I'm single, not griping about any current crushes/boyfriends, just to give context. Also, I'm 24--

So I've dated a lot of guys, and only about half to two-thirds of the time am I actually their "type", physically (as far as I know). But I never feel scared that they'd leave me to go off in search of someone else who's more their type. I think I'm pretty fabulous and appealing in my own right, and nobody I've gone out with has done a thing to make me doubt myself. 

But when the guy's "type" is an older woman I just feel kinda...weird I suppose? Not threatened, so to say. Because again, I don't worry they'd leave me for an older woman. I just get a different internal reaction to it, which I can't quite describe. 

For example, I went out with a guy who really liked fresh-faced redheads with nice boobs. Now, I'm a brunette who likes to do Kardashian-ish things with my hair and makeup, and my boobs are...round but pretty average. I could never have aspired to fit his type, and yet if we were at a bar and in walked some fabulous redhead, I couldn't give a damn. Then I went out with a guy (actually two guys, but one more recently and one three years ago) who liked older woman. And when a lovely 40-something woman would come in, I'd find myself thinking "don't notice her don't notice her..."

I think--mayyybe--that it may have something to do with how I like to come across as being experienced and sophisticated, but an older woman has a decent chance of topping me at each of those. I also realize I don't sound very sophisticated right now, thus not bringing this up with anyone I know personally ;)

By the way...I'm not older-woman bashing at all! You all are more than welcome to dip into my age pool, haha. And I know that myself at 24 isn't exactly young and fresh. I hope I don't look like I have a totally skewed perspective on age here. Just wanting to get my confusion out and hear your thoughts.   I think everyone has "buttons," things that just bug the shit out of you for no reason.

For me (and I think for other women in their thirties) I am more worried about younger women!  I have complete faith in my husband that he wouldn't leave me for a younger woman.  I'm smart, funny, and clean up pretty well when I need to, but my age is the one thing about myself that I *can't* control  You will one day become an "older woman", but I can never become a younger woman!

Funny story:  When we were dating, I asked my now-husband what his type was.  He responded with, "You." :)  I've heard of similar sorts of feelings before - not the same, but I recall a lady talking about finding it difficult being with a bisexual guy - that it was one thing if a guy liked blondes and she was a brunette, but if a guy liked another guy it would be something she couldn't compete with, as it were.

Of course, the reality of the situation is that if a guy is interested in you, he isn't going to go out looking for version 2.0 of you (or since his 'type' is older women, would that make it an earlier version..?) - he'll want you for you.  Oh man! I don't even know how I'd be about a bisexual guy. I'm endlessly fascinated by unusual sexual interests, so I bet I'd have fun going out with one for a while...but I don't know about long term...yeesh. 

I've never feared that a guy would leave me for someone else, it's just a weird discomfort I get where older women are concerned that I don't get otherwise. Maybe it's my own fear of the unknown, not understanding the allure, as it were.  While I don't necessarily view mature women as being my 'type', I have been in a few relationships with them.

There is the increased life experience. Just the simple fact of living for longer meaning she's accumulated more experiences. Perhaps already been married, already had a lot of relationships. That can then flow on to other areas - she will more likely have a better idea of what she likes and doesn't, what she wants and doesn't. She may be less likely to put up with shit, and that in and of itself can be an appealing thing if you're drawn to stronger women. Potentially more sexually experienced, less reserved. Possibly more likely not to give a shit about societal expectations.

In reality, a lot of these reasons could be just as easily used when asking someone why they prefer older men. That makes perfect sense. Thanks for lifting the shroud of mystique for me :) And as another commenter pointed out--one day I'm going to be an "older woman" too!  Absolutely true!

And if at that point you're already with a guy that likes older women, he's only going to appreciate you more as the years pass. :D Sometimes 2x makes me feel so awesome.

Once I sent my ex (while we were dating--one of the exes who likes 'em older) a picture of myself pouting over a stack of files at work and he said that the way my face crinkled in the pout made him think I'd be a very pretty older woman. It felt really nice. 

Okay I think I'm done bothering myself about this older woman thing. Whew!   This bodes well for me %] </snippet></document><document><title>Help</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19496s/help/</url><snippet>23, Been on depo bc and recently switched to an estrogen free bc pill because I was getting month long periods with the depo.

The Real Love Of My Life With Me!</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/pOOVGxa.jpg</url><snippet>  "Dress how I want without fear of abuse."

Oh lady, I hear you. I hear you so very much. Two years ago, this week, I left my abusive husband and fled the state. One of the best feelings was being able to put on whatever clothing I wished and not have to change before he got home to avoid being threatened. 

You are so very strong. You are an inspiration to others and to that adorable child of yours.  He changed everything about me while claiming that he loved who I was. I was to dress modestly(Not that my ideal dressing isn't modest) and treated me like a child for the things I enjoy. Hearing cruel things like that drained my confidence, I wish I could find pictures of my time with him, I look like the dead...but I didn't even want to be seen.

I'm glad we both have gotten out of what can be the worst thing a person could ever go through, someone you love destroying you. Over the course of a three year relationship, I went from a vivacious and outspoken woman who loved her life... to a cowering, anxious model of whatever he wanted me to be that day.

I realized, after I left, that I hadn't created ANY art or any writing in over a year. The core aspects of my personality--being a creative and outspoken spirit--was missing 100% from my life. That should have been an indicator at the time, but I couldn't see it.

I challenge you to add some wonderful new hobbies to your life to help you feel even more like yourself again. And, again, I'm SO glad you're alive and here to tell your tale! So many people in abusive situations never get out. I thank the Universe we're both here. :)   Just woke up, barely ready, but I still feel like crying of happiness every time I look in the mirror and feel like I'm finally looking at myself. Best thing I've ever done was leaving him, and I hope anyone in my shoes can manage to get away and be happy. It's worth it endlessly. This post just made my day. Thanks for sharing! :) Thank you so much, all the warm feedback and upvotes are kind of making me overwhelmed with joy, I'm so grateful. c: Just woke up, barely ready, but I still feel like crying of happiness every time I look in the mirror and feel like I'm finally looking at myself.

  Dat feel; fistbump. :D Your son is gorgeous!  Thank you very much, he's the little love of my life, the one thing that kept me going and I can say was worth it from that 6 years is him. Such a little sweetheart.  So happy for you! And he's a cutie pie!!! :)  Thank you so very much! It still feels scary and new, even at 2 months away from him, but life is so much better now. My son makes things all the better, he's a little sweetheart.  Can I ask how you survived leaving? Do you have your own resources? Can you move across state lines with your son? I am overwhelmed with happiness for you.  It was difficult, it took many, many tries. He kept managing to lure me back again. An old friend ended up catching up with me, since she was female she wasn't as much of a "threat" in his mind. When she heard me talking about our relationship, she mention her concern.

One of the big things about emotional abuse is that they often make you think it's all in your head, or you deserve it, or you're the one in the wrong, and having someone say that to me was really eye opening.

To be honest, I got angry, I got bold. I started taking over again, "rebelling" if you will. As soon as I realized my friends and family, support groups he severed me from, were still there for me it all became a lot easier.

I now have been sure to keep up a social life to keep me happy(I go out once a week, have friends come over, go out and about with my son and other people) and that has also helped in restoring both my happiness and my independence.

I wish I could move across state lines, to be honest living 5 minutes by car away from my ex is a little scary for me, but all my family is in this area and their emotional and financial support for the time being is unfortunately a must.

Also, I sort of was scared of what people would think of "emotional abuse" as opposed to physical, that they'd think it was a petty problem, and some people do. Though I know now most people don't, and placing into consideration my struggles in my younger years with my Bipolar Disorder that seems like the silliest thought I could have ever had...

My biggest advice would be if something feels wrong, don't doubt it. And a person who declines couples therapy to save their 6 year long relationship because they see nothing wrong is a problem.    Is the real love of your life that Nintendo shirt?  Because although your son is adorable, that shirt is pretty awesome.

  I don't know what is with me today, I almost cried today watching yesterdays Rachal Maddow Show when a parent who lost a child in a school shooting was asking for gun reform, minutes later the crowd cheered John McCains comment that "the automatic weapons ban will not pass through congress".
I really had tears in my eyes during that, I can't imagine having a crowd cheering for accessibility for a weapon that killed your child.

And now I see someone as beautiful as you standing with your child and finally being free from someone hurting you for no reason.

Why is the world so full of horrible people? Maybe I should cry like this everyday.

Mood swings, nausea, sore boobs...
I took it out last week for good and got my period. But then I got it again two days ago! It made me realize how much my body is messed up from these hormones. What are your experiences with more natural birth control methods? What are the best ones?    Being on the pill made me super depressed and I had zero sex drive. Since coming off of it I feel human again! Currently I'm using condoms but it's only because I had a failed insertion for the paragard IUD. My uterus is apparently tiny.

It comes with it's own set of problems, but it is hormone free, you don't have to think about it more than once a month and it's more effective than the pill!  Same here. I was never horny and I'm not sure if it was a side effect of BC but it was hard to get wet during sex. Having my period twice in a row sucks but I think I'll feel better in a few days. Thanks for mentioning iud I completely forgot about it. I think I'll talk to my doc about it. Sorry it didn't work for you I hope you find something you like more.  Does anyone else have experiences with iud?  Definitely check out the link LXV posted.

I have the copper IUD (Paragard). I haven't had it long enough to really give you an account of what it's like having it but I CAN tell you what it's like being off hormones. I knew I was feeling bad on the pill but, now that I'm off them and can look back, I realize that I was even more depressed, angry and apathetic than I thought. I also had weight issues. I didn't ever suffer from a low sex drive but now that I'm off the pill, I'm like the Energizer Bunny in that department.

Overall, I feel happier, healthier and more "me" than I have in years. :) How is the paraguard?  My gyno didn't want me to get one as we may want to remove in &amp;lt;2 years to try for kids.  She said it could take 6 months to get used to it and didn't think it would be worth the cost and pain/getting used to it period for only a couple years.  But I soooo miss my sex drive and feeling normal, anything is worth that.  What do you think??  Is the adjustment really that bad/long? How is the paraguard?

Does anyone else have experiences with iud?   I would really like to hear more as well!  I was on the Nuva Ring for 5 years and never had any bad symptoms, but had a low sex drive. As that's not really an objective thing to quantify, I just figured that's the way I was and it was due to stress, or just being married for a whole and loosing that 'young lust' of first being together.  Last year I went off it, and after a few months the change was huge!  I was way more horny and into sex.  It was great knowing they this is what my normal unaltered state feels like!!  And I was crushed I had missed out for years.  The mismatched libedos was a huge problem for our marriage, and I feel cheated now knowing that much of it was just due to the HBC.  We recently rethought our plan for kids, and I want back on BC in December.  By late jan, my sex drive was all gone.... Again. They were really against letti g me get an IUD as we may try for kids in &amp;lt;2 years.  But I don't want to miss out on 2 more years if great sex when I have already missed out on so much!!!  Anyways, sorry for the rant, but I'd love to hear any other options.  My gyno suggested a diaphragm.  Has anyone ever tried one?  How is it having sex with one?  I don't want to have to cycle through 5different kinds of BC to find one as it takes months to know if it is different or not.  I can't speak from personal experience, but I do know that I have a friend who had a diaphragm for a while and liked it really well. She said that they never felt it during sex or anything. The only reason she went back to hormonal BC was because they doubled up with condoms and had one break and weren't exactly super confident after that. And we're in college, so kids are definitely not an option right now and the diaphragm was only about as effective as condoms, which wasn't effective enough for them.  A cooper IUD is great for me have had it for a year and a half and no issues. They say you may have heavier periods but I have never had that happen. I forget the specific name of the IUD.

But let me explain.

I am not the type of person that looks through peoples phones, let alone a girlfriend that goes through her boyfriend's. However, in a moment of sheer weakness, curiosity and what have you, this morning when I woke up I perused his phone (terrible, but I don't regret it now).

I found quite a few texts between him and his ex-fling before we started dating. Nothing super scandalous, but a few about the "old times". I mean, it wouldn't really have bothered me if he didn't say something like "I miss those times (hanging out with you and other friend that was mentioned)" and she replied "Oh 'happytobejustme' wouldn't like you said that!" Which just by her word choice caused my heart to drop. I continued through the texts which by that point my heart was beating a thousand beats per minute and I felt like running far far away.

A million options ran through my head within a split second, "should I say something to him?", "should I pretend nothing happened?", "should I text her back telling her 'happytojustbeme' is the greatest gf ever"? (one of the stupid ones of course, lol) and anything else you can think of. 

But the feeling that I was having was overwhelming. It wasn't so much jealously as a complete lack of self confidence in myself. I was so occupied with the feeling, that the first thing I googled was "how to feel beautiful." Kinda strange to be the first thing I'm concerned with after feeling threatened by another girl, rather than just rage at my boyfriend or her.

I've had a sketchy history of self-confidence, good times and bad times, but this was the first time I googled something like trying to feel beautiful. I am really glad I did.

I am so glad because I realized I barely appreciate myself, like ever. Never in a million years would I say "being beautiful" was one way to describe me. But I AM beautiful.

I wrote a little note to myself with the topic of how great I am. Sounds SUPER conceded, but it was literally the greatest thing I could have done for myself at that moment. Instead of acting passive aggressive, or downright accusing my boyfriend of not loving me anymore, I wrote myself a freaking "I love myself" poem.

And you know what? I ain't even mad. Ain't nobody got time for that!

TL;DR Instead of getting jealous and passive aggressive to my boyfriend for texts I didn't like, I wrote a pro-me message to myself and ended up feeling great.  Well, congratulations on this realization. Your post feels like a celebration, so enjoy that feeling.

Self love is an interesting concept, I've read a lot about it a couple of years ago, and there's a few posts from this blogger that I remember loving, so check them out, they might help: http://galadarling.com/static/getting-started-with-radical-self-love So I am on my phone and just glanced at that page and I already love it! Thank you for the great link, when I get home I plan in spending some time on it!  I'm really happy for you that you're pleased with your response to this situation, however your post raised a few flags for me. 

I agree with letsgorunning's point that you need to be more honest with yourself about the 'type' of person you are. 

But even beyond that I think it would be healthy if you took a little bit of time to figure out what type of person you would like to be. I know it sounds absurd, but sometimes it's really crucial to evaluate what characteristics about ourselves we want to exhibit and which we would like to improve upon. It kinda bummed me out to read that the first thing that you were concerned about was 'feeling beautiful.' I understand that the term can also be used as a descriptor for 'inner beauty' but in this case, I feel like you were primarily concerned with demonstrating to yourself that your physical attractiveness makes you superior to his ex-girlfriend. It's pretty fucked up that, because of a variety of social pressures and norms, the first thing that women want to identify as is attractive. I'm glad that you were able to avoid some painful emotions by telling yourself that you're beautiful, but it makes me sad that you weren't more congratulatory to yourself about your wicked sense of humor, your ability to make your dad's favorite oatmeal cookies without burning the edges like your mom does, your awesome singing voice, your encyclopedic knowledge of 1980's hip-hop -- really anything beyond your attractiveness. 

There is more to being a woman (hell, a person) than being 'beautiful.' 


   &amp;gt; I am not the type of person that looks through peoples phones, let alone a girlfriend that goes through her boyfriend's.

At least be honest with yourself. C'mon, you invaded your boyfriend's privacy, and blithely say you don't regret it. You may have some more soul searching to do. Well, I'll be honest and say that I'm pretty disheartened that the first comment to something really huge that happened to me was telling me I need to soul search some more lol. But I should have emphasized how WRONG it was for me to have done it, because it is, no way around that. I hate myself for doing it, but usually I assume people regret snooping because of what they find. What I meant was that I don't regret looking and finding something I didn't like, so instead I turned it around and improved my self confidence out of it. At this point promising to never do it again may sound shallow, but my goal is to never succumb to self-depreciating thoughts that would lead me to blatantly invade someone's privacy ever again. nah, good for you. if someone says they've never ever snooped on anyone they're lying. everybody gets curious, it's natural (sure it's wrong, but it's not like it's out of the ordinary). and everyone on the internet is so quick to condemn you because they're all perfect saints, right?

it's awesome the way you dealt with this. i'm glad you aren't going to hold texts from before you were dating against your boyfriend and be all passive aggressive and jealous and quiet and short with him for 3 days until he's all "whats wrong" and you're like "nothing" for the thousandth time until he buys you something 

Also fuck yeah, write an  i love myself poem every day if you want to. confidence is wonderful, there's nothing conceited about that.

Is that irrational?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193etb/a_classmate_23_asked_me_18_to_go_dancing_with_him/</url><snippet>Basically, the title. This guy in my intro to salsa class asked me to go dancing with him, and later in the conversation brought up the fact that he was 23. I'm newly single (really, really, newly, as of 3 days ago) and just want to go have fun and flirt and take my mind off things. However, this guy's age bothers me. He also made a few forward remarks that put me off a bit.

Some advice? Should I go or not? I'm not sure if I should trust my gut here, or if my gut is just scared of "the single life."    I really don't think the age is a big deal. But if you're uncomfortable then don't go.      &amp;gt;He also made a few forward remarks that put me off a bit

Don't go. His forwardness was just him testing the waters.  Once you guys are alone, at night, at a club, this "forward behavior" will escalate. 



     I know it might be an unpopular opinion here, but sometimes age does matter. Sorry, but I think there's something a little weird when a 23 year old guy can't find someone his own age. No offense to you for being 18, but there's a huge maturity difference between an 18 year old and 23 year old---a 23 year old is going to have a lot more life experience than you, just in general. A lot happens in college! So frankly when I see guys in their 20's aiming for high school girls, it really rubs me the wrong way. I usually see it as a red flag. I think there are plenty of times when age difference doesnt matter that much, but this isnt one of those times.

Especially since it makes YOU uncomfortable. If it is making you feel this way, trust your gut, girl! Don't go out with him. Trust me, you can find someone your own age!</snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] My strong, witty, amazing daddy from his teens to his 40's. He was murdered in 2005 when he was 46.

I'm an awkward in between (some people call me a big girl, others don't) I want to wear shorts or skirts in the hot days but all of the ones I come across seem to be for tiny petite girls, figure hugging, small sizes and denim all the way up the yoni. Not comfortable in the least, nor do they look any good.

So, my question for you ladies is how do you deal with shorts? Do you wear them? How do you feel in them?

Edit: Thank you all for your help!! :):)    It took me a long time to get comfortable wearing shorts in public. I started with women's athletic shorts--basketball shorts because theyre longer. Then last year I finally mustered up the courage to buy nice shorts because lets face it, I can't look the least bit classy wearing gym shorts with a cute top. I felt awkward wearing any jewelry with those shorts.

I shop at Old Navy for shorts because they have a wide selection of lengths for their shorts. They do offer short shorts, but they also offer them several inches longer, and so on. I am now very comfortable in them. It helps that I've really crackd down on my diet and exercise vigorously now, but I'm still very curvy and I'm probably always going to have big thighs--my thighs are almost entirely muscle, but they're huge,  and sometimes it makes me wish my legs were skinny and less muscular so it would look alittle nicer, but then I remember I'm freakin strong and it's okay! Yes, I love that Old Navy has longer shorts! I realize shorter cuts can make your legs look longer (and therefore make you look taller and thinner), but I've never felt comfortable in them because they always ride up and it feels weird to show so much of my thighs. Old Navy's five inch shorts are amazing. I wear bermuda-length shorts exclusively because anything shorter always bunches up around the crotch for me.      </snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] I got married recently &amp;amp; my talented friend tailored this wedding dress for me.</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/VavHe4g.jpg</url><snippet>  More pics: [[1]](http://i.imgur.com/B6jihbI.jpg) [[2]](http://i.imgur.com/ci87bdq.jpg)

Sorry the pics are not very detailed. We didn't hire a professional wedding photographer and these photos were kindly taken by my friends. I basically went into super awkward mode during the wedding and completely forgot to ask my friend to take a full body shot of my dress.

**Edit:**

Here's [another pic](http://i.imgur.com/5I8634W.jpg) from my friend that shows the original concept and the development of the dress. The 1st pic was my original sketch. The 2nd is a [real dress](http://www.forherandforhim.com/lace-vintage-bridesmaid-dress-with-flouncy-skirt_745.html) I used as inspiration. The 3rd was a sketch made by my friend using the real fabric &amp;amp; color in the picture. The 4th is the finished result.

I didn't expect to get so many compliments! Thanks for the kind words &amp;amp; well wishes everyone. :)

In case you're wondering about my headpiece, I got it from [here](http://www.etsy.com/shop/mignonnehandmade).  That is one dapper duo!  Eeek! I love it! Your dress absolutely adorable, and I love the color! You're gorgeous! Loving your husband's look as well, you're just too cute together. Congrats!  What gorgeous work!  I'm blown away by the lace detailing and I love the overall vision you had for your wedding.  Congratulations! The lace on the sleeves was actually painstakingly hand-sewn by my friend. The original fabric is see-through tulle and I have unflattering giant arms so I enslaved my friend to sew the lace like that, haha. I'm so impressed.  You've got an awesome eye for design and her skills as a tailor are stunning :)  Does she have a website or any sort where she does orders?

I know the Lolita crowd would adore her.~  My daughter was sitting next to me when I clicked on this.. She immediately squealed "Ooh! She's so pretty!". 
I wholeheartedly agree!

Congratulations on getting married xx
  You are ADORABLE. Seriously. I love the dress! Especially the mint green lace. It gives it some character. Congrats on the wedding and I hope you guys have a great and happy life together!      SO CUTE.  That is a beautiful dress! Congratulations!   So pretty, can we see more pics?   My niece keeps saying I got married in a "princess dress." You actually DID. How gorgeous is that! And look at that lace... your friend is very talented indeed! Haha when I hear "princess dress" I imagine a dress with super poofy &amp;amp; long ball gown, with trails and whatnot. It is very poofy, if not long! It's a princess dress that is suitable for dancing! :)

I got married in a maroon sari, not exactly a princess dress, but I *did* wear a tiara. It's indeed suitable for dancing, since it's inspired by 1960s retro dress. If those TV shows &amp;amp; movies I've seen are accurate, ladies used to dance wearing this kind of dress anyway. And yes, the dress is super poofy. My friend made me a petticoat with lots of layers to go underneath the dress.

A sari and a tiara sounds interesting, do you have any pics you wouldn't mind sharing? [This is my favorite photo from the wedding](http://imgur.com/qbErNzL)

Lately though (and i know this may sound silly) when she asks me about the guy i like and i tell her how he's doing,etc... it's like she rolls her eyes the entire time. Or she gives me this look that says she thinks i'm making it all up. Other people that have asking me about him don't give me these weird looks. (i don't know how to describe it, you'd know it if you saw it) 

I'm about afraid to tell her anything about him because she'll just rolls her eyes at me some more.  

Why would she roll her eyes all the time like this when she asks me about personal things? I thought maybe it was just a habit but she only does it when talking about the guy i'm interested in and she's usually the one to bring up which is weird.   This isn't normal at all.  In fact, it is a bit scary.  How long is this "entire time"?  Do you go on and on and on about it?  Now, this *can* be tedious, but if that was the case, why would she ever ask you again?  

Next time she asks anything, don't give her *any* time to roll her eyes.  Just say "everything is fine" or "same old, same old, no changes" and shift the conversation topic back to work.  She doesn't sound like a person I would keep telling my personal stuff to at all.  I say put her in the *co-worker* category, as opposed to the friend category and keep her there for good.  That's super weird. The only reason I could think of to explain her behavior is if you're in that nebulous phase with the guy where all you're doing is "talking", which is pretty boring from an outside perspective. Nevertheless, that's so rude of her. You could gently call her out the next time it happens - "oh, is this not exciting for you to listen to? (in a genuinely inquisitive tone)" That way, if it's unintentional on her part, you won't be putting her on the defensive.  It sounds like she wants to sound like she cares (by asking) but isn't following it up with the actual caring bit. I agree that you should call her out on it, by asking why she would bring it up if she doesn't actually want to hear about it.   That behavior is so...weird.  Why bother to ask you about him if she just dismisses what you say?

Does she know the guy?  Are you and the guy dating?

I know this sounds farfetched but maybe she is in a relationship with him and just asks you about him to make herself feel superior?  This is the kind of thing that leads me to believe a person is violently crazy and avoid them at all costs.</snippet></document><document><title>I'm writing a paper on domestic violence, and I need your help.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193gos/im_writing_a_paper_on_domestic_violence_and_i/</url><snippet>I have to interview someone who has been in a situation of abuse, either emotional, physical, from a significant other, family member, anyone.

I loooove how the photo is filtered/coloured so that it looks like a photo from the 60s too. Specifically like a magazine photo from the 60s!
  Verrry cool.

And where are the 1930s ones?   Awesome!! This is really well done! If you're taking requests, I'd love to see either the 20's or the victorian era :)   First, I love your look! But I came here for a different reason... If you are using a high pass filter, you're using it incorrectly. High pass is primarily for sharpening, and they way you're using it is creating an exaggerated contrast halo around your edges, instead of sharpening them. It makes it look more like bad dodging and burning than anything else. I'm happy to tell you how to use it correctly if you'd like (if that's what you're actually using and not dodging and burning, which in that case, size your brush to the area you're working on and adjust the hardness so as not to leave obvious edges). I neither dodged, nor burned, nor used a high pass filter. I don't notice it as much as you do, but it is probably from using the shadows and highlights adjustment in Photoshop. In any case, I wanted the photo to look a bit surreal and overdone (think 60s makeup translated into a photo), so if you think that less halo achieves the effect better, I'll give it a try next time. This is [another](http://i.imgur.com/Tc520of.jpg) from the same set.

 Thanks for the crit though! No prob bob. I don't mean to knock you because I really do like it, but my degree is in, well, like 72% photoshop so I can't help but see these things... I also am a helper (even to my detriment sometimes) and I wanted to help :D  Just out of curiosity did you use VSCO film when editing this photo? Also what kind of camera did you use to take this?   Do you have a shot of your face? I think 60s eye makeup is some of my favorite eye makeup.    </snippet></document><document><title>Cheap and non-time consuming ways to be good to ourselves in times of stress?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193f00/cheap_and_nontime_consuming_ways_to_be_good_to/</url><snippet>Greetings, my ladies and lady-likers.

I'll spare you all the details* but one stressful year has gone into two and I am beating back some serious burnout.  I've taken seminars and read articles about how to handle stress and they almost invariably instruct me to "be good to myself."  Now, I really don't know what this even means.  All I can think of is taking vacations, going to spas, having mani-pedis, going out for drinks, etc. all of which take time and money I don't have.  But, I think I am not thinking about this the right way, I am hoping someone here can put me on the right path.  There are some basics I am able to grasp: I eat well (both healthfully and sufficiently), and get as much sleep as possible and make that as much of a priority as I can.

One things I have found is cooking.  Nothing extensive that would take up too much valuable time, but some simple things, it means saving money and it can be meditative and nice.  I make cinnamon pancakes almost everyday for breakfast and am now very practiced at making a healthy creamy mushroom soup from scratch that takes only about 15 minutes of actually work.

I also like a bath before bed, but I often work until the last moment of wakefulness and have only enough time to get out of my clothes and hit the sack.

*Quick summary for those interested: bad economy/bad boss/sick elderly parents meant moving to another country for a new job where I work harder for much less money. I work very long hours, sometimes 8 AM to 11 PM and I spend all my spare time and income either taking care of my parents or on visiting my partner, whom I had to leave behind.  I would say I am doing the bare minimum in terms of taking care of my folks and my partner, but I thing everyone is being patient with me.     Yoga is an amazing way to relieve stress. I started going to Power Yoga classes twice a week after a particularly stressful time at work, and it's done wonders for my emotional health. (It doesn't hurt that it tones my muscles as well! 

Each class is about an hour long, although depending where you go, they can be a bit expensive. (The studio I go to charges about $12 a class.) The good news is that most yoga studios will hold a free class once a month for beginners. I'd check to see if any studios near you had something like that available!   I have had periods of time when my life was a lot like what you're describing.  Here are some of the things that I found helpful:

Take 5 minutes to do some deep breathing/visualize yourself someplace relaxing, like on the beach or in the woods.

Listen to some good music or a good book on tape on the way to/from work (with headphones if you're on public trans, of course).  

Light a scented candle while you're getting ready for bed.  If you are super-tired, you might want to consider a floating candle in a bowl of water, in case you pass out before extinguishing it.  Trust me, it is worth the precaution.

Make yourself a cup of peppermint tea. Even if you can't sit still to enjoy the whole thing, the smell is wonderful, and hopefully you can sit with it for a few minutes at least.

Give yourself a foot rub.

Spend 5 or 10 minutes each day journalling or drawing.  It's not a lot, but it's something.  And setting aside just a tiny bit of time makes it more likely that you will actually do it.

Good luck to you!  &amp;lt;3   Learn the basics of self massage. It's amazing how simply paying attention to areas of physical stress can help clear your head as well.   </snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] I am an aspiring portrait photographer, here is some of my work!</title><url>http://imgur.com/a/ojqN7</url><snippet>     And now i'm never getting my portrait professionally done, because you don't say whether these people know you're putting them up on Reddit, shared with the world.

This bed has definitely been part of why our relationship has morphed into what I call "PG Polyamory" over the past year. We have cuddle parties all the time! ;) Can you explain more about how that works like is there a snuggle club you can join? Is the club jackets? Or or or pjammies?!

I would craft the bed out of walnut myself and it would be awesome. I like the nest idea, it's cozy and it's economical for heat retention in winter. Oh well, another dream completely dismissed. "But it looks too grand or regal." Our bedroom shouldn't be for show, it's for practical uses and comfort. Why should I care what other people think about how I comfortably sleep? I've always wanted to do this, and my girlfriend completely boycotts it. Maybe she boycotts it because she **does not** want to sleep in a cave. Maybe she actually enjoys the natural light coming in when she wakes up. And maybe she just does not like the look of a big 4 post bed! Meh.   Amazing! 

BTW, Your husband reminds me of a finnish singer called Jari Sillanp&#228;&#228;: http://static.iltalehti.fi/viihde/sillanpaaSW_vi.jpg  If I didn't have to pee so often each night, I would totally build one of these.

Eye patch and a bow?

I'll wear a fun hat and we'll save a town from something.  And a SW shirt too. Win.  Such a great photo. You look so damn focused. Thanks. :) All credit to the photographer. It was a pretty intense competition that I wasn't planning on shooting in, but someone had to drop out at the very last minute, and I got asked to replace him.  I hope you did well!  I love Archery and am not bad at it, but I can't do it because my boobs get in the way. After a couple weeks of doing it at school (when dinosaurs roamed the Earth) with some difficulty experienced, I managed to snag the tip of one of my girls with the string. Childbirth didn't hurt as much, but I did keep trying, just doesn't work.
I admire y'all for doing it, it's so much fun. (Though I do understand why the Amazons always cut one off to help with shooting)    what's your preferred brand and draw weight?  and how did you get started in this?  PS: wanna be on my team after the apocalypse?  :) Whoops, I just put this above as well, but I don't own any of my own equipment as of yet, because I'm in grad school, and I'm not sure where I'm going to live when I've finished this whole process in the summer. Right now I like the riser and limbs I'm using- KAP and W&amp;amp;W, but I think I'd like a Hoyt riser (really like these limbs though). My draw weight is 33, I believe, so it's not too heavy, though perhaps a little heavier than some of the other club bows used by women. 

And sure :D   And left handed at that!  Dirty little secret: I'm right handed, but I'm left eye dominant, so I shoot left handed.  that's really interesting.  i never considered how cross dominance would affect archers (i'm a firearms/crossbow shooter).  i think i'd go batty if i had to shoot southpaw. It was a bit strange starting out (which was a few years ago, but then I stopped shooting during my undergraduate because I didn't have access to a range), but now it would seem strange to me to shoot the other way. The left hand of my body seems a lot more flexible as well. Bit odd.  Dirty little secret: I'm right handed, but I'm left eye dominant, so I shoot left handed.  That's awesome. I am right handed as well but when I wrestled in high school I taught myself to execute moves "left handed/sided" so I could switch up. Can you shoot the other way or does it feel too odd?   This is really awesome! I adore your eye patch :).

Edit: I forgot to ask, how does one go about building up the arm/upper body strength to draw a bow? I've always been interested in archery but lack upper body strength. Person-mildly-interested-in-archery, here. It takes working up to it. A lot of young women start out at 30 lbs of resistance, then go up. It's also a lot easier and less tiring to point the bow straight up into the air and pull straight down on the string, as that uses different muscles. This is really awesome! I adore your eye patch :).

Edit: I forgot to ask, how does one go about building up the arm/upper body strength to draw a bow? I've always been interested in archery but lack upper body strength. A lot of people hit the gym for it. Make sure to concentrate especially on your back muscles, because that's what you should be using to draw the bow back.       Where'd you get your tank top? :D   That's a nice Recurve! Thanks. I wish it was mine. Black Bart is a pretty good bow, but he belongs to the club. :( I could never afford him otherwise.  I have a Korean target shooting recurve bow, 35lb. They're not very expensive in Australia. Unfortunately, I can't join a club because you have to use club bows and they're all compounds. :( Used equipment isn't too expensive (in comparison to new, anyhow), but I'm still not sure which country I'm going to be living in come August/September, so I don't want to put down money for such a big investment, and then risk travel damages. The riser is a KAP and the limbs are Win and Win. It's got kind of a dinky little Cartel super basic sight, and I think the long rod is Cartel as well. Draw weight is about 33, I think? I could probably move up, but I don't think the club has as many limbs to switch around, so I'll probably shoot this for the remaining time I have it.  Mine is Cartel as well. I don't use a sight at all either. My partner and I are shooting targets out in this random field in the middle of nowhere. 
Does the sight improve your accuracy by a lot? I mean, I've really gotten used to the feel of my bow and I hit the target about 60% of the time on a good day.  Oh yah. I don't have the best sight but it's still rare that I hit outside of the red/yellow, and I only miss the target if I do something seriously wrong. There's shooting barebow as well, of course, but I haven't learned how to do it. I shot without a sight for two years though, but there's really no place for that in competition (unless you do barebow).  I might get a sight soon then :) Realistically, I want to be able to hunt. So accuracy is a huge, huge factor in that. Hm. Alright, sight-shopping soon.  Check out this archer. She's pretty badass.  </snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] Despite living with asthma all my life, I decided to try and overcome some of it by running.

Or maybe something else...?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193d6j/endometriosis_or_maybe_something_else/</url><snippet>I'm starting to wonder if I may have endometriosis...

* I've had extremely painful periods since about the age of 14-15 or so (I'm 23 now) - bad enough that I feel like I'm being stabbed. I've thrown up from the pain before and almost passed out a couple times.
* My period is also ridiculously irregular. For a while it would come every 4-6 weeks, and then occasionally it would take 3 weeks, or 7...then about a year ago I had it last for about a month, and then after that, it started coming every two weeks. It hasn't stopped doing that.
* When I had the issues last year I went to my gynecologist and had an ultrasound - there was one very small cyst. They put me on birth control and checked again in a few weeks, and the cyst was gone. However, my period kept coming twice a month, once in the middle of the pack and once on the inactive pills. I tried another pill after a few months and instead of every other week, it would come in the middle of the third week of the pills and last for a week and a half. I've been trying another pill for the past three months and it's back to twice a month again.
* Periods have been slightly less painful for the past year, but still pretty bad. I'm not entirely sure if this started when it started coming twice a month or when I started the pill. In any case, the one I'm having right now is pretty awful. I've barely been able to leave bed for three days.
* I also tend to have other gastrointestinal issues (constipation, loose stools, gas, stomach aches) that get significantly worse during my period, although these are at least partially due to anxiety.
* I occasionally have some pain in my abdomen during sex, usually on one side or the other - I've read that pain during sex can be a symptom, not sure if that's what is meant. It's usually not too severe.

I've tried everything...in addition to birth control, I've tried tons of herbal supplements, NSAIDs and other pain killers, vitamins, etc. Nothing does more than put dents in the pain. I usually just have to wait it out. None of my doctors have ever suggested that it may be endometriosis, but after reading up about it, I find that my symptoms seem to line up, and it sounds pretty common. I'm seeing a GP on Friday, so maybe I should bring it up? I just don't want to sound like a hypochondriac...but I really can't take this anymore and I don't know what else to do. When I was in high school and college I could get away with missing stuff now and then, but not so much now that I'm working full-time. I would feel super awkward telling my boss I had to miss work or work from home because of my period - so far I've been referring to it as a "stomach issue." Any suggestions?  I agree that it sounds like your periods are having a significant impact on your life and that a lot of your symptoms sound consistent with endo. If it were me -- and it's been me, aside from the irregularity issue -- I would bring it up with a trusted health care provider. Even though your past ultrasound only revealed one cyst that went away -- ultrasounds usually *don't* pick up endometriosis, so an ultrasound that doesn't show endo isn't conclusive. 

As for suggestions, I'm not sure if you're referring to your doctor or your boss. Unfortunately, I don't have too many suggestions for work issues, as I still feel awkward bringing mine up to my employer. (I call it a "chronic pain condition" and hope no one doubts me or wants further details -- because it will be only a matter of time until the phrase "bleeding like a sacrificial goat" slips out of my mouth before I can stop it.) For the doctor visit, would you be able to print out (or copy and paste into a word processor and print out) this post to make sure there's a clear understanding of your history and how this is affecting you? Additionally, would you be able to remember some of the specific supplements and painkillers you've tried? I know that for me, being very clear that I had tried lots of things and *none of them were helping* was crucial to being taken seriously. And writing it down was a way to make sure the doctor saw it regardless of what questions they asked (or didn't ask).

What to do about a new pack?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1932nr/lost_my_birth_control_last_night_what_to_do_about/</url><snippet>Hi ladies...
So last night I'm 99% sure I put my bc in my coat pocket and only after getting in my car and driving halfway home I realized it wasn't in my pocket. Called the bar I was at and nobody's found it or seen it. I was about 3 weeks into the pack. (Also it was in a monogrammed metal case so I'm pretty sad I lost that). 

My question now is I was at the gyno this past week and she prescribed a new birth control for me. I can go fill the rx today so that's no problem, but when should I start it? I've never lost a pack of bc I already started so I'm not sure if I should take it today, start tomorrow (Sunday is my usual start) or wait for next week or something? 

*UPDATE* My drummer found my pills in the case packed in with his stuff from last night! Phew! Of course he found them right after I filled the new prescription.... :p Thanks for your advice though, everybody!  Start the new pack today. Treat it like the pack recommends forgetting a pill -- which is typically to take it as soon as you remember.  
  
Your next cycle's timing will be different though. Right, it'll be coming a day earlier so I have to use those stickers or whatever. Take one when I fill it and then take another pill tonight at my usual time?  Start the new pack today. Treat it like the pack recommends forgetting a pill -- which is typically to take it as soon as you remember.

I started my period today, hoping I'll bounce back to normal within a few days, but it is unbearable. This week has been a week of crying, loneliness, self loathing and torment. I have had no interest in doing things I love, frankly running away and suicide have been on my thoughts. I'm not really serious about them, it's just another thing to make me miserable.

I have never been an angry PMSer. My mom would snap and go on tirades, as would most women I know. I, however, just fell into a sudden, week-long depression that made even being awake a living hell. I
 Can do it. I've been surviving it since I first realized what was happening, but when I'm normally a level, fairly optimistic, utilitarian person, being crippled by sadness and all these terrible feelings is just pushing me to the end of my rope.

PMS is ending for me in a few days, hours hopefully. I am usually very level when on my period...but I need help. I really do.

I am on a balanced diet and exercise regimen, and I have a very regular sleep schedule...I usually see those suggestions a lot. I dunno what else I can do. Does anyone have any advice? Thank your for your help.  I'm sorry you're having a bad weekend.  If you take good care of your eating, drink lots of water, have a healthy sleeping schedule and exercise regularly, the only advice I can think of is find a good doctor and let s/he know what's going on with you.  Maybe there is medicine/therapy out there that can help you.  Maybe there is hope and you don't really have to go through this every month.  For this month, it will (hopefully) go away soon.

Maybe these will help, I hope the articles have some suggestions that will work for you. Thank you for the help...sorry if I asked questions that have already been answered...I didn't mean to be redundant...I just got desperate. Don't be sorry, it'll all work out. I really like the book, [Don't sweat the small stuff.](http://www.amazon.com/Sweat-Small-Stuff-small-stuff/dp/0786881852), and I'd recommend picking it up if you haven't had an opportunity to do so. It really helps put things into perspective, even if you're right in the middle of a bad funk. 

Hope you feel better. :) Most of the time I have a pretty decent outlook. My brain has its own flow chart of "am I happy y/n?" I cycle through that and generally come out on top. It's just during this week...it's like my flow chart gets broken, so "am I happy? N. play video games/read/watch show you like/hit the gym" turns into " I hate all of those things and don't want to be alive."

It sounds silly...and the irrationality of it normally makes me laugh (I find a wealthy of humor in myself) but...there is no laughter. Only sads.  I don't have advice -- just solidarity. I get it bad, too. :(  If you ever need someone to talk to or feel bad with, you can PM me...   I have the *worst* PMS, so I hear you, lady.  You may want to talk to your doctor, because it sounds like what you're experiencing may actually be PMDD, and if you're open to it, your doctor may change the birth control you're on or put you on b.c., or give you an antidepressant to take for the second half of your cycle.  Definitely worth bringing up, since your doctor will have a better sense of what might be the best approach for *you*.  


Unfortunately, I react badly to both hormonal b.c. and antidepressants, so I take B12, calcium, magnesium and an herbal supplement called Vitex starting about a week before my period is due.  I still get moody, but it's no longer to the point where I am unable to function.

I hope that you find something that works for you, and that you feel better soon!   I am feeling better today actually. It's like there is a light switch going off in my head and there is suddenly a reason to live. It's really weird. I know in my consious mind that it is all very ok and my life isn't that bad, and just absolutely miserable. Today I'm at work, doing something I am not too thrilled about, and pretty chipper (I am a sports writer. I'm watching girls tennis...it's not so bad...I would be crying in a bathroom if it was yesterday.) I just talked to a guy totally out of my league to say hi. I'm just so different.

I think the part that makes me feel the worst is that I am in a long distance relationship, and to tell the boy how much my life sucks for a week is killing me. I hide it and drive myself nuts because I hide it. I don't want to bring him down.

I don't have a regular doctor right now, unfortunately so I kinda bounce from doctor to doctor when I have to get birth control. I would like to talk to someone about different options. I might try St. John's Wort, but it looks like there are some complications with birth control as far as that's concerned. I have to figure something out though. The "light switch" feeling sounds soooo familiar, and it sounds terrible to have to live with this.  If you don't have a regular doc, you might want to check out Planned Parenthood, or maybe just go to a new doc to talk over your options.  It is true that St. John's Wort can reduce your bc's effectiveness, so that's prolly not the best option.  If you are on a triphasic bc (eg. ortho tricyclen or tricyclen lo), you might do better on a monophasic pill, or something like the nuvaring, but of course that involves talking to your doc.  

Anyway, I really, really hope that you will see someone about this.  I very much understand the feeling of being that depressed and feeling just plain crazy, and it's something that you don't necessarily have to live with.  Also, although it sounds like even when it's bad, you are able to keep perspective that it will pass, getting that depressed can be dangerous.

I'm really glad to hear that you are feeling better now, and I hope that you will find a doctor who can help you figure out a treatment approach!</snippet></document><document><title>I'm 15 years old, and I'm either pregnant or extremely paranoid</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/192wfm/im_15_years_old_and_im_either_pregnant_or/</url><snippet>A little bit of back story, I've been sexually active since last November, and have probably had sex about 10-15 times, all with the same guy, with condoms being used EVERY single time. And every time, we even stop half way, he'll pull out (with the condom still on) if he feels like it's getting too full (he leaks A LOT before ejaculating), take it off, and replace it with a new one. We do this to ensure that the condom is never *too* full before he ejaculates and will cause breaking/leakage to the condom. So basically, we're really careful and his penis has never been inside me without a condom on. Anyway, now about my period. Ever since I first got it when I was 11 years old, it's been incredibly irregular. I'd get it once every 6 or 7 months, and there was a time where I only got it once or twice in a whole year. So it's always been incredibly irregular, except for the past 3 or 4 months, where it HAS come every month, give or take a couple of days. It might have come a few days earlier than it did last month, or a few days later, but it still came once a month. Except now, where it's been about 2 weeks from the estimated time that I should have  gotten my period. I should mention that I had a UTI two weeks ago. It began a few days after I last had sex with my boyfriend, and after some research I found that sex can cause that. The UTI lasted a whole week, but it's gone now. I don't know if that can somehow be a reason for my late period. Besides that, I've been having some cramps for the past week, but still no period. The only time I usually get cramps are the day before and the day of my period. I have no other symptoms of pregnancy, though. No tender breasts, no hot flashes, or headaches, or spotting, or anything else. I know the only way to know for sure is to get a pregnancy test but I'm so embarrassed to go to the store to buy one... I mean I'm 15! I know it's pathetic but I don't want to have to deal with that 3-second transaction with the cashier. I may just make my boyfriend buy one for me.

So TwoX, can you please ease my mind, or give me some insight, or ask me some questions or anything? I feel like I'm completely paranoid. I never knew how true the phrase "the only time you're happy to get your period is when you've become sexually active" is until now. I just wish it'd come already

**UPDATE: so I guess it's pretty ironic and coincidental, but I just got my period. Guess I'm not pregnant! Also to whoever is downvoting all of my posts, I don't appreciate it and you suck.**  Do you have any stores near you that have self checkout?  If not, go to the pharmacy counter to buy it.  Pharmacists tend to be more professional about things like this (though, of course, there are always exceptions).  

Honestly, you're very likely not pregnant, though.  I know that the possibility of it is really scary at this point, but it sounds like you two have been very smart about protection.  You do need to get a pregnancy test now, though.  On the off chance that you are pregnant, you need to find out as early as possible so you have enough time to mull over all of the options available to you. I don't know of any stores that have self checkout. I decided that my boyfriend's going to buy one for me on Monday while I wait outside. I'm a scaredy-cat, I know. But he's not as embarrassed about things as I am so he'll have no problem with that. We'll go to his house afterwards and I'll take it there. I'd feel a lot better if I took the test with him being there also (not literally, as in him being there in the bathroom with me, but you know what I mean) Okay, that seems like a fair plan. I'm glad you're both taking responsibility for your sex life and the possible consequences of it.   Good luck! ::hug:: Thank you :) I'll probably update this post on Monday with results of the test. Hopefully it'll be a big fat "NOT PREGNANT!"  Thank you :) I'll probably update this post on Monday with results of the test. Hopefully it'll be a big fat "NOT PREGNANT!"   I'm confused... the condom gets "full" *before* he ejaculates?

Stress can effect the timing of your periods... and your body fighting off a UTI *might* be enough stress. You're probably fine, but definitely take that pregnancy test. You'll feel so much better. If you make your boyfriend buy it for you (good call) have him buy a few so you can have them on hand in case this problem crops up again. Also, you can buy pregnancy tests online for cheap and with anonymity. Maybe you have an older friend with a credit card who can order some for you?  Go get a test. Seriously. If you can't handle the responsibility of going to a pharmacy and buying a test, you probably aren't responsible enough to be sexually active.

No one here can tell you if you're pregnant unless you show us the results of a test. Otherwise it's only speculation.

If you're worried about people recognizing you at the pharmacy, either go to a far one, or just get it over with and realize that, should you be pregnant, people will be finding out anyways.

You should think about also going on BC if you're that worried about pregnancy.   This has totally happened to me. I'm extremely irregular and at one point I went 6 months without a period. If you are irregular to begin with hopefully you're just late. Remember that illness and stress can affect your period. So do weight and exercise. 

If you can, try to start birth control. Pitch it to your parents under the idea that its to regulate your period. If you don't have insurance a local planned parenthood can totally work with you. 
 We'v talked about birth control and I really want it, but the problem is that for a lot of pretty complicated reasons that I'd rather not talk about, my parents *can NOT* know about it. I'm not entirely clear about the steps to getting birth control and I don't know much about parental consent or attendance to getting birth control. I don't know if it makes any difference that I'm in NY (for example, in New York a minor can get an abortion without parental consent, but it's not the same for all the other states), so I'll do some more searching around and I'll eventually take a trip to a nearby Planned Parenthood to see what can be done Go to Planned Parenthood! They understood my situation when I was younger and explained to them that I couldn't let my mother know. They also understood that for this reason, I couldn't get my insurance card (how was I going to explain why I needed it?) and use my insurance. They just gave me the BC pills for free.

Very worried.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/193xyx/strange_menstrual_cycle_very_worried/</url><snippet>So, there's a long story to this (about a month long), but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

I began seeing this guy two days before I stopped bleeding during my last period. So almost a month ago. We've had sex approximately 10 to 13 times this past month. During this time, we had a minute or two of unprotected sex about 6 of those times (but he was far from ejaculation all 6 of those times) and the filled condom slipped off once on day 15 of my cycle (one day after ovulation). Me being a dumbass, I didn't take the morning after pill. I know, it was a dumb decision, I understand that. So for the rest of my non-bleeding time I was freaking out. I was very worried that I would get pregnant.

My period came a day late (it was supposed to come Wednesday, but instead it came Thursday). I woke up Thursday morning with blood soaked underwear, sat up and it was a heavy flow. Fantastic. All of Thursday was a heavy flow (blood clots, went through about 3 pads) and Friday was also a heavy flow (bled through the sheets when I woke up Friday morning, went through 3 more pads, still a lot of blood clots). Then today, Saturday, I woke up with only a few spots on the pad. I changed it after a shower and I've still been on the same pad and there is only one real spot of blood and no clots. It went from extremely heavy to rather light.

My worry still is pregnancy. I figured I was in the safe zone because of the amount of bleeding I had--it wasn't a light period or spotting, but a lot of blood in the first two days. My periods normally don't get this light this early. They're heavy the first three days (although the third day can be lighter than the first), and then they begin to get lighter on the fourth day.

I'm worried. I know the obvious "take a pregnancy test!", which I am planning to do as soon as bleeding stops completely. Maybe today is just an off day or something, but it's weirding me out. I've been googling around for the past two hours and I have no information. I plan to call the doctor on Monday if this is still an issue too (they're not open on the weekends). Any knowledge?

Also, I know, unprotected sex can be dangerous because of STDs. We've both been tested and we're both clean.

Edit: I've also had my usual cravings when I started my period--sweets and deep fried food. So it started out like a period, but it's not a normal one that I usually have. I'm also slightly bloated, which is normal for me when I'm bleeding.  Weird periods happen.  You dodged a bullet.  

But if you keep having unprotected sex (yes, even if he's "far" from ejaculation) that bullet WILL find you.     How do you know you ovulate on day 14? You could have ovulated on day 12, or 22. It's different for every woman, and different for every cycle. </snippet></document><document><title>Finally worked up the confidence to dye my hair something my mother didn't approve of!</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/Aawcg8B.jpg?1</url><snippet>  Red? She freaked out over red? O_O I'd think blue or green, but...

Anyway, it looks amazing and I love the color! You look so happy :D I know, she just though it was &#8221;too wild&#8221; for what I should do. But she's actually coming around to it the more she sees it. That always happens with moms for some reason... I wanted to dye my hair a lighter BROWN (my hair is really dark brown) and she was like, NO. So when I was at college, I just paid for it myself. And she was like, OH I LIKE IT when she saw it. And then I facepalmed.

she got over it. 
she then got jealous of my adorable hair. I know, it has since inspired her to dye hers Moms, right? :)  I *love* the color. Can't believe your mom wouldn't approve of that - it looks relatively natural and suits you immensely. Thank you (: it looks almost purple in-person, and she was against it before. I went ahead and she came up to me while I was doing my research paper and was like, &#8221;Oh, its not bad.&#8221; I wish I had done it sooner. Whenever I dye my hair dark red, it starts out as purple until I've washed it a few times. If you just dyed it, give it a little time to fade and she'll definitely love it. But even the fresh color looks great on you! Excellent choice. Whenever I dye my hair dark red, it starts out as purple until I've washed it a few times.

Could you tell me what dye you used? I love this color! Could you tell me what dye you used?  I'm a natural redhead, but I really admire this color. It's so deep/rich! It looks really good on you. :)  That's an absolutely lovely color on you!  Why wouldn't see approve? It looks like it could be your natural hair colour! (it's a lovely colour btw)   I think it is a lovely shade, and complements your coloring and features beautifully.  You look beautiful!  What's wrong with that color? It's stunning! You look fab! 

Your mom.. needs a bit of a reality check. ^ _^  Gorgeous!

I've always wondered what I'd look like as a red head.  well dont you look beautiful  Absolutely breath taking, I really like the color :)  i LOVE it! i have the same cut as you and have been contimplating on dye-ing it as well. red is what i want, you make me want it even more! very lovely :)  Wow! That hair! You look so adorably beautiful.:)  I don't think you upped the contrast enough, I can still see you.  I was expecting something much less natural-looking! It looks very nice. I also dye my hair red. :) I love being a red-head!</snippet></document><document><title>IFF My sons face after playing in snow for the first time last night</title><url>http://imgur.com/1N5vJdo</url><snippet>  What's IFF?  Look at those red cheeks! Must have been quite the day!  Looks like a young haley joel osment.   He is super cute!  What a cutie! Did he have fun?

When I was a kid my dad used to make huge snowforts with us with slides on top and a dug-out interior so we could sleep in it. Playing in the snow is so much fun as a kid!  He looks identical to uh-huh from the little rascals movie.   So cute! He must have had a great time</snippet></document></searchresult>
