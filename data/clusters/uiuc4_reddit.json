    "title" : "Daily Illini: \"Despite common complaints, student senate far from a waste of money\"",
    "snippet" : "  I'm just going to respond to some of the points made:\n\n&gt;last week, we passed legislation asking that we forever be the Fighting Illini, an issue that has been on this campus since the removal of the Chief.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:  \n\n&gt;The name \"Fighting Illini\" was retained, as the NCAA rescinded its criticism of the use of the term. The name \"Fighting Illini\" pre-dates the Chief Illiniwek symbol and was bestowed upon the team in honor of Illinoisans who fought in World War I; the use of the name \"Illini\" dates to the 19th century.\n\nNice!  The senate didn't save a damn thing; people are just misinformed about where \"Fighting Illini\" actually came from.\n\n&gt;co-sponsored a well-attended debate between the College Democrats and Republicans. \n\nGood, just what everyone needs.  College aged kids arguing about politics.  So useful, and no one ever hears it enough.\n\n&gt;In November, ISS passed a resolution urging the University to divest from coal, an issue at the University for quite some time\n\nIn November, good job!  From:\n\nhttp://www.dailyillini.com/features/article_dd73d7f5-602f-5ef7-a88a-57f72fc8a8ad.html\n\n\"[Abbot is] currently in the middle of a transition away from coal, as called for by the University’s 2010 Illinois Climate Action Plan, or iCAP. The iCAP aims to eliminate all coal use at Abbott by 2017.\"\n\nWay to be on time and relevant, ISS.  Please don't change.\n\n&gt;Just last month, we established the iRent Program and rented out free iClickers to students, saving them about $8,000.\n\nFuck you.  Get more professors to start putting the homework questions online or handed out in class, so students can buy old versions of textbooks for $20, not $200.  You know, something useful, instead of a $20 bauble that we'll use several times throughout our education.  The iclicker is probably the best thing we buy, in a uses:cost ratio.\n\n&gt;We passed a resolution urging the University to remain “carry-free” due to the proposed firearm changes in Illinois\n\nSo, earlier, he was talking about good debates and political views.  Shouldn't this have been decided there, instead of by the ISS?  Not that their resolution would do anything.   WE'RE IN ILLINOIS.  You're about as likely to get the government in Georgia to start handing out posters promoting abortion clinics as concealed carry on this campus.  [Oh yeah, I have a source for this:](http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx)\n\n&gt;there are 21 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus: Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming.\nIn 23 states the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nIt sure is likely that Illinois, which *still* doesn't have concealed carry (yet), is going to force the campus to have concealed carry.  Good job.  The ISS, again, passes a resolution akin to \"The sun should rise tomorrow\".\n\n&gt;Many students, despite our efforts, still don’t know who we are or how we can help them. Promotion is an important part to any organization’s success.\n\nNo, it's just like regular politics, but to an even lesser degree (at least they can pass binding resolutions).  We've heard of the ISS (lord knows we see enough sidewalk chalk), but as long as it keeps its hands out of our pockets to do nothing and play the silly resume fluff game, we don't care.\n\n\n&gt;we avoided a possible split from the graduate delegation through committee reconstruction.\n\nDon't care.  again, stupid internal games.\n\n&gt;Although some senators may disagree with our spending, they are hypocritical in doing so. The same senators mocking our efforts actively participate in the Senate’s work. \n\nI'm not even sure how to begin addressing this bullshit point.\n\n&gt;The events that we host and co-sponsor are beneficial, such as the College Democrats and Republicans debate. \n\nI see why this is the point that she chose to raise again.  It's the *least* asinine \"accomplishment\".\n\n&gt;To argue that the Illinois Student Senate has done nothing this year but promote itself is incorrect. \n\nGood point!  Time and money wasted, with no real accomplisments.\n\n&gt;Rest assured, we will continue to be the voice of our constituents and welcome anyone to attend our Wednesday meetings to voice their concerns. Remember, elections are coming up, so if you want to directly change this organization, the power is in your hands.\n\n\nThe only useful part of the whole thing. Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume? Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume?  Does the ISS have any *real* power?  Are any of their decisions binding upon the Board of Trustees, or do they just pass non-binding resolutions expressing the \"sense of the student senate,\" similarly to how Congress declares \"Turnip appreciation day\" or \"National gravity awareness week\"?  I have twice said (on Reddit) the ISS does nothing to improve my education. This article hasn't done anything to change the factual accuracy of that statement. \n\nFacilitating a debate between students arguing within a false dichotomy? Passing resolutions that amount to nothing more than recommendations (and pointless ones at that, grade replacement for transfer credits, lol-worthy)? What the hell is the female leadership program supposed to do, and why should any of us believe the ISS knows anything about leadership? What else? Coal? Like the university administration isn't already aware of the issue. No-carry? Thanks for letting the next armed nutcase walk on to campus knowing none of us can fire back. \n\nAsking a private company to divulge their budgetary information? Here's an idea, instead of laying on some private company why don't you apply pressure to the UIUC administration to lower tuition and fees? Oh, that's right, it's an important issue directly affecting students, so obviously it isn't an issue the ISS cares about.\n\nThe article is a typical non-answer. I still do not want to give you $2 every semester.  How about you get some money to the Math department so they can stop hiring such bad teachers and being assholes about it? ",

The organization needs more people who think like the /r/uiuc community.  \n\n* If you have a remote interest in running for Student Senate, SORF, or Trustee, you should attend the mandatory information session on February 6th at 7:30 in the College of Law Building Room D. \n\n* SORF and ISS will be hosting an event, with **free pizza**, to talk about how to run a successful campaign.  This will be on February 13th at 5:30pm in the Illini Union Pine Lounge.    ISS must have quite the pizza budget. I know, right? This time SORF is paying for the pizza (not that it matters, since it all comes from the same place).  Can SORF reimburse the $800 it promised us months ago before it buys everyone pizza? Thanks.  I guess their way to run a successful campaign is to offer free pizza  From what I understand, the ISS really doesn't have much power...  I feel like these meetings aren't publicized very well (irony right there). Do they have a facebook page that posts their committee times? Tweets? Reddit has been my only source.  It's IL.StudentSenate on both [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/il.studentsenate) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ILStudentSenate). (The tweets aren't great - mostly motions and amendments during meetings, but they're something I guess.)\n\nEdit: spelling  honestly all i want is for the whole smoking ban to be rethought.  or even put to a .....shudder....student vote? honestly all i want is for the whole smoking ban to be rethought.  or even put to a .....shudder....student vote? The smoking ban was put to a student vote last school year.  \n\nQuoting from the DI:\n\n&gt;David Pileski, student body president, said the vote “doesn’t necessarily reflect a 100 percent-smoking ban.”\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Kassar said efforts to accommodate smokers would still be made. He said the possibility of constructing smoker pods or designating open air areas for smokers would be brought to the table when University administration looks at a ban.\n\n&gt;“Even if there’s 10 percent that says no, we need to compromise because we can’t just leave smokers out like that,” he said. “Not everyone’s going to be happy, but we’ll try to make it work for the majority of them.”\n\nKassar was the Trustee at the time.\n\n According to [that article](http://www.dailyillini.com/news/article_7e6c65cb-6227-56cf-b834-2e4daa02300b.html), it looks like Hannah Ehrenberg was the student trustee at that time... Although I'm actually pretty sure Ehrenberg and Kassar had a shitfest over who would receive credit for the initiative. ",

Hopefully the new Webmaster will be able to speed up the delivery of information to the iss.illinois.edu webpage and allow the public to see information at an expedited pace.**\n\n\nI would appreciate if you would take the time to read some of my ideas before you are quick to judge. I understand that public opinion is not very high right now.\n\nI want to change that.\n\nHello!\n\nMy name is Ben Deese and I am campaigning for the position of Illinois Student Senator, LAS, for the academic term of 2013-2014. I am currently a junior in Economics, with concentrations in Eastern Religious Studies, Mathematics, Japanese.\n\nI am running for the Illinois Student Senate because I am tired of the failed policies of old, and would like to bring in a fresh perspective. I will be graduating in May 2014, and therefore do not have to worry about re-election. This will allow me to be more free in my criticism of university policies, as well as fight for YOUR rights as a student. I understand that this may seem like typical campaign jargon, but I promise you will be satisfied.\n\nAs an out-of-state student, I know the financial pressures and concerns of those of you who pay the increased tuition and international fees. It is outrageous, and the bureaucracy needs to be addressed head on.\n\nIf elected, I will make sure there is a painless way to contact me regarding the issues YOU want addressed:\n\nDon't like a new fee? Let me know!\nWant to know what is happening in meetings? Feel free to ask!\nPissed off because our tuition is constantly increasing? ME TOO!\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n• Creation of ISS Inspector General: This position would be created to audit the decisions of the Illinois Student Senate, and to give political transparency for all Illini. This is specifically in response to the fiasco over Campus Spirit Revival and their backdoor approach to legislation.\n\n• Creation of ISS Stenotype Operator: This position would entail recording all senate proceedings via written and/or oral transcripts. These records would then be available to all.\n\n• Weekly Massmail to all students: This would explain the highlights of the weekly session, as well as provide links to the transcripts of all proceedings for public benefit.\n\n• Creation of ISS Webmaster (Already exists. See update above): This position would entail keeping the ISS web portal up-to-date with all spending procedures and referendum announcements, as well as working with the ISS Stenotype Operator to make all sure all weekly proceedings are easily available to the student body.\n\nThere are an infinite number of questions and concerns the students of LAS have, and I assure you I will dedicate my time and energy to make sure your experience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is as stress free as possible. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, concerns, or proposals please post here; you may also send me an email, text, or tweet. I promise to reply back within 24 hours.\n\nEmail: deese2@illinois.edu\nTwitter: @bendeese\n\nWith that being said, I thank you for your interest!\n\nHere is a link to my Facebook page if you are interested or have friends that might be.

This was the letter I received from Robert Palinkas, Director of McKinley Health Center, regarding your question about condoms. I hope this helps:\n\n\"Ben Deese\n\nI write to you today as a response to an inquiry you submitted through McKinley’s website.\nMcKinley has a long history of supporting access to birth control, reaching back several decades. Certainly McKinley’s commitment to supporting birth control issues predates the recent Affordable Care Act, which has considerably opened up access to contraception for the American public in general.\nOver the years, McKinley Health Center has provided six to ten different versions of oral contraceptive for a small fee of just $5/month. This is in spite of the fact that McKinley purchases those medications for $15 to $20 per month supply through our wholesale provider.\nThe recent provisions of the Affordable Care Act now have moved University of Illinois students and virtually the entire American health insured public to completely free access to contraception. This is because insurance plans are now required to identify a list of no charge medications which must be supported by the licensed insurance underwriter.\nAs a result of those provisions, students at the University of Illinois can take their receipts for most of their contraceptive purchases to their insurance carrier and submit a claim for reimbursement. Assuming that the products are among those listed on the insurance carrier’s free formulary, students could expect to be reimbursed for their acquisition, subject to the provisions of their individual insurance plan. One should remember that students have health insurance from many different sources, and the provisions of their plan will vary in accordance to regional laws governing insurance underwriting.\nMcKinley also offers a number of related no charge services to students at the University of Illinois in related areas. For example, individual sessions with our sexuality health educator are no charge, and McKinley provides regular limited access to no charge condoms to all students at the Health Resource Center at the Illini Union, McKinley Health Center, and at several of the cultural houses.\nFinally, McKinley Health Center has peer educators that are certified for the purpose of presenting sexual health related programs elsewhere on campus. Perhaps you might be interested in becoming involved in this project?\" I did read that whole answer, and honestly it seems like a lot of bs. My main problem is as follows: talking to friends at other big 10 schools and ISU and a few other universities I have come to the conclusion that EVERY university besides ours has no limit on condoms or else the limit is much higher than 12 per 2 weeks. Most universities also had clubs handing them out on their respective quad or else just had bowls full of them in the dorms. It just seems like mckinley is cheaping out is all. It's still better than no free ones at all, but thank you for doing the research and getting an answer for me! I can see you do care about this and care about the students and that is important. A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  I will write an email to McKinley today and ask what would be required to increase the distribution of free birth control to students. I will request permission to post the response to this thread. \n\nOn the point of GPA, I agree fully with that suggestion. In terms of pure math that would make sense, but the problem is that would allow above a 4.0 on the scale. Instead, removing an A- grade would make much more sense. If one can get above a 90% in a course, one deserves a 4.0. My mathematics professor, Aldo Manfroi, does this. It seems to work well.\n\nThing to note: This change would undoubtedly require sweeping change to the educational policy, something that requires Board of Trustees approval.  In past semesters when people in a similar situation as yours posted on reddit these are the 2 biggest things, and yet nothing seems to change. What can you do personally to follow through on these things? Also, A- being a 4.0 would also be acceptable, seems like a good compromise. I will bring it up at the ISS meetings, and if that doesn't work I will contact the university directly. Also, I have friends in Illini Media who could run stories to get the public involved. If thousands of students started mailing the chancellor and other board members, extreme pressure to act would be put on them. If a state or national news source found out, thousands of more voices could be added to the cause. The power if social media to make democratic participation easy will act as the key to change. \n\nI will also have a relatively light course load next year, so if elected, this position would be my primary focus.\n\nBasically, a \"No\" will not dissuade me from my goal, which is to make sure the opinions of the student body are brought to the table and then given an examination.  If this is a sincere answer then I truly respect that and hope for the best. As a senior graduating in May I would not personally benefit from this, but I hope future generations of students will.

If you like wonky details of GPA, here is one even within the same university:\n\n* At UIUC, an A- scores 3.67 in your GPA.\n* At UIS, an A- scores 3.70 in your GPA.\n\nAs someone who delves into student data sometimes, GPA is horrifying. :D This is atrocious. If you can provide me a link to the source — for verification — I will add it to the original post, as well as my Facebook page.  Please don't try to change it. It's really not worth trying to change. Some of your other ideas are really good and worth spending time on.\n\nAnyway! The best verification I have for you is the top result from a google search for **site:uis.edu gpa**, but it was a word document.\n\nAgain, please just file this away under \"universities are complicated\" rather than under \"universities have fixable problems.\" :) I understand that you may feel that way, but unless the idea of change is instigated, nothing will ever progress. To change GPA at the university is a daunting task. However, if the University of Illinois decided to re-evaluate its policies it could be the tipping point to others doing the same. \n\nOnce one brick falls the rest will tumble.  Hi Ben,\n\nAs a current senator I'm excited to hear about your desire to gt involved and make positive changes. I would suggest though that you spend some time learning more about ISS before going out and campaigning. Most of the things you are campaigning for already exist or are out of the purview of the ISS. I don't want to rain on the parade, but I wouldn't want you to make any promises to your constituents that you will not be able to fulfill.\n\nI'm more than happy to chat with you about ISS. Feel free to contact me.\n\nKevin Seymour\nGraduate Senator Kevin,\n\nI understand that many of these ideas are already reality. The thing is that the senate.illinois.edu portal is very confusing. Although videos exist, they are not up-to-date with current information.\n\nI understand that some things may be out of the purview of the ISS, but that means that they can be added to the constitution. Just because something cannot work today is not an excuse to prevent change for tomorrow. Ben,\n\nI agree that the ISS' website is very confusing (iss.illinois.edu is the one I think you are referring too? -- senate.illinois.edu is the domain for the UC Senate which every student senator is also a part of but mostly contains faculty). The ISS has recently hired a webmaster who is currently working to update the info and make it more user friendly, this should be coming out in the next week or so.\n\nSimply changing our constitution will not suddenly give the ISS new oversight over anything we so choose. The shared governance process is very complex, and I wont try to go into here.\n\nAgain, I'm more than happy to help you better understand this in more detail if you want to meet up at some point. I think its important that candidates are armed with knowledge about how ISS works. The reason so many people are upset with the ISS these days is because of misinformation.\n\nKevin  These are great suggestions to change university policy and I hope they work well; I'm sure many in ISS and even students that aren't have ideas of this nature. \n\nOn this note, I'd like to ask a few questions - as a senator, what actions will you have to take in order to complete these goals? How much agency do you have as an individual senator to change policy? Lastly, how much agency does the ISS have in creating university policy and acting as a check and/or balance for the administration?  What do you think of the $2 fee that ISS is hoping to tax its students with?   What is your take on the current budget of the ISS? Spending $3,786.42 for hand outs on quad day just to promote the ISS seems like a waste of funds. The same applies to the PSA. What is your take on this spending ? \n[budget](http://ge.tt/3yOtxnW/v/0?c)    If you want people to vote for you, give them candy. A Werther's Original stapled to a flier will do you wonders.  To address your second and third points:\n\n - The ISS already has a staff of interns who keep pretty decent minutes (which would be on the website if it was working). In the past, ISS kept video recordings of all it's meetings, but this stopped for reasons I'm unsure of. (Probably because no one ever asked to watch them.) I'd advise against hiring an actual stenographer, as they tend to be expensive and you'd need someone to translate all their notes anyway. Maybe a YouTube channel?\n - The University Administration limits the ISS to 3 (iirc) Massmails per year. The \"Administrative Agreement\" can be renegotiated, but it's a package deal. Once you start bargaining, everything ISS related goes on the table. On a related note, the current Vice-President Internal and Historian of ISS has been trying to set up an at-least-monthly newsletter to summarize passed and pending legislation. Might be worth sending him an email.\n\nI'd also like to point out that ISS has nothing to do with setting tuition.  You say you want to \"fight for YOUR rights as a student\" which personally I find refreshing since it seems that most ISS members just want material to throw on their resume.  \nSo on that note I'm curious about your opinion on the upcoming smoking ban.  There's no reason to take away the right of someone to smoke when a compromise of making designated smoking areas protects both smokers right to smoke and nonsmokers right to not.  \n\nAlso, how willing are you to compromise and when it comes to policy you disagree with?  Will you stick to your guns not matter what, or try to find a middle ground? The smoking ban is a touchy subject, but as an elected official I do have to be neutral and represent the student body. As a non-smoker this issue does not personally effect me, but I do have friends who smoke, and I have heard their anger over the ban.\n\nI agree with you and would attempt to propose an amendment to allow designated smoking areas, if that is what the students want. The city of Champaign-Urbana tends to have a lot of wind, which could be a potential problem for smoking areas, causing the smoke to drift to those who do not want it. However, the wind would also blow the smoke up and away, making sure that the smoking areas are relatively clean. \n\nYou are right that smoking areas work; as a California resident, I have been to Disneyland multiple times, and to cater to all customers, there must be smoking areas in the park. The Walt Disney Company has done an excellent job in allowing their smoking customers to be as welcome as the non-smoking ones. To create smoking areas would require a monetary investment, but if it could work, the rights of all students would be honored. With that being said, the issue is that in a democracy people will still be disappointed no matter what.",

This just in: Engineers get the wages you are talking about more frequently than most majors. The average job an engineer can find right out of college will pay more than the average job most other majors will find, and for good reason. I don't know if it is for good reason.

While in school and jobless, you can start by making a monthly budget of food, rent, shopping, bills, etc. You can get a feel of how much you're spending and areas you can save money in (ie. fast food, shopping, beer).    Business major checking in. Going to whore myself out to Corporate America while still living like a college student. You shouldn't be spending more than $20,000 a year to live comfortably. As long as you make more than that (very easy,) and don't go on any big vacations (not so easy,) you should be able to put a lot of each paycheck into your debt. \n\nIt's all about living within your means. Hope this gives you some comfort. Dolla dolla bill, yall. Only problem is, \"You shouldn't be spending more than $20,000/year to live comfortably\" is a complete load of garbage.\n\nhttp://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2011/10/03/the-secret-to-living-well-on-20000-a-year\n\nYou give up quite a bit of creature comforts to live on $20k a year. No car, no health insurance, no retirement savings, going to the movies is considered a splurge. If you want to live \"comfortably\" in this town, which is significantly cheaper than a real city, you'll need more than that. I don't know about Seattle, but I can assure you that thousands of grad students live in this town on $20k or less (before taxes), while having both a car and a health insurance.  If they do not work over the summer at all, grad students average $17,183 per person. They live, but it'll assure you none of them will say it's a comfortable life.\n\nIt occurs to me that $20k is probably doable if you've got roommates. I suppose that would make a huge difference when compared to where my expenses go. I'm a grad student and I feel very comfortable on the 1.8k-ish I get per month.  Rent+utilities+food+monthly costs is maybe 800/mo tops (I have shopped around to keep this down), and this leaves me a ton for travel, climbing gear (big money sink), eating/going out, etc.  \n\nIf you aren't lazy, supporting someone, or really materialistic, I don't know how 20k isn't reasonable to live on. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low. Imagine being in Chicago or any other major city. You can't get by paying $350 rent. You are going to be paying at least $700 for rent and higher on everything else. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low.

I'd go with the \"It's expensive to be poor\" type things.\n\nRemember, if you're take home is $1,800 you're making closer to $27k.\n\nImagine dropping $500/month off your take home and where your quality of life would be. Sorry, I think it was about 20k for 9 months or something like that.\nSure, I would rather have the extra 500/mo, but I hardly need it.  I'm able to travel for swing dancing or climbing nearly every week, and if I had to stay home one extra time a month, I would hardly be crushed.  I could probably manage to brew more often.
