    "title" : "What do you guys think of the Club for Growth?",
    "snippet" : "The [Club for Growth](http://www.clubforgrowth.org/) is a non-partisan, largely free market PAC that mostly campaigns in Republican primaries, but has campaigned in general elections and supported Republicans, democrats and independents to promote more free market politicians in congress.\n\nLike most of you, I am skeptical of the political process as a whole, but I don't steadfastly believe it's impossible to hack.  C4G's approach is to concentrate a dilute group of voters on a few key races that may make a marginal difference, and ignore all other elections, which is smart: most races certainly **don't** make a difference.  However, I think there may be cases/races when this approach is justified.  But I want to know what you all think.  Why would an anarchist want to participate in elections or care who wins them? While I don't vote myself or support voting in elections, the fact of the matter is that elections will still impact our lives. If you can steer them to be less detrimental, then you have done some good.  1. This perpetuates the state.\n\n2.  This uses aggression against others without their consent (though admittedly many will happily reciprocate). 1. Arguable, my vote even in a local election would be a mere drop of water in the bucket. My voter participation is ultimately a nonfactor either way.\n\n2. You can vote and not use aggression. Rothbard laid out the case for voting in 'self-defense' long ago. 1. It continues what the state considers its mandate.  This will probably be the perception of the statists anyway, but that is not a justification for support.  Micro-aggression is still aggression.  Aggression which might happen anyway is still aggression your part if you do it.\n\n2. You are welcome to give a convincing argument of how participating in the coercion can be self defense but 'Rothbard said it' is not an argument. \"This perpetuates the state\" and \"this uses aggression\" were also not arguments but instead direct assertions. \n\nAs the analogy goes, not one of my creation but rather dating back to Spooner, when election time comes you will become a slave to others if you do not vote. However, you can cast your vote to counter their aggression and act in self-defense. This is not condemned aggression as it is done to protect yourself, not to harm others.  Neither of my assertions were arguments from authority (which is what 'Rothbard said so' is).  You are free to argue with my assertions (which is what I invited you to do, though you did not) but a valid rebuttal is not an argument from authority.\n\nYou are entirely ignoring agorism or other ways of living as a voluntarist within the state.  They all exact some cost which is not low currently (because of the background societies) but if it was worth it to you to not be a slave you would not be one.  This does not excuse you from aggressing against others.  You are arguing that the ends justify the means, which I disregard as invalid reasoning. Your assertions didn't even have an argument from authority, they had nothing other than the assertion, as if they were absolute truths. You are free to argue with my hasty reply, but a valid argument is not \"X is so,\" when \"X\" isn't a priori.\n\nI have mixed thoughts on agorism, but I will laugh at your \"if it was worth it to you to not be a slave you would not be one\" assertion. Take the example of taxes: paying them does not mean I consent to the state or condone its actions, it means I prefer giving up that money instead of going to prison. To say otherwise is to argue that the victim of a robbing didn't think it was worth it to not get robbed when they handed over their wallet. \n\n&gt;You are arguing that the ends justify the means, which I disregard as invalid reasoning.\n\n1. I am not, I'm arguing voting can be self-defense and that this is not conducive to a ham-fisted \"means-ends\" aspect.\n\n2. There you go again. \"This reasoning is invalid.\" You do a wonderful job forming your own arguments.  Why would an anarchist want to participate in elections or care who wins them? Lesser of evils should always be superior to more.  The lesser evil is still evil. Would like me to pour 2 cups of acid on your head or 2 gallons? Doing either is committing an act violence on the non-consenting.  This is more like you and I getting together to decide if its better to pour a gallon or half a gallon of acid on someone else's head (and debating the merits of how much is likely so splash on us). I point a gun at your head and say, \"I'm going to pour acid on your head, and I'll let you choose 2 cups or 2 gallons. If you don't answer then the decision will be entirely left to me.\" What's wrong with answering? No, your framing is incorrect.  Whatever you say to the person coercing you to do something you know is wrong is still wrong, but that is not what democracy is.  No one is holding a gun to your head to make you vote (outside of places like Australia), and when you do vote politicians take it as a sign that you agree with them (or that you trust them to make decisions for you and others).  So, 'what is wrong with answering' is that the person you are answering honestly believes you are giving them permission when you answer. Who cares if they think that you think that they're honest? They got the guns and threats and unless you want to die for a cause, the best thing would be to beg for mercy until you get enough people on your side realizing the extortion. Why would an anarchist want to participate in elections or care who wins them? I don't see everything in terms of a hard \"right\" and \"wrong\", I am a utilitarian.  Rights are made up by men for the purpose of getting along well.  The fact that I disagree with most people on how public services should be provided and paid for does not, in my opinion, give me license to accuse them or the whole system as evil.  Evil is relative.  For the purpose of making progress, constructive engagement is necessary.\n\nWhile I don't care who wins most elections, there are always a few that are worthy of attention or activity.  Most of the time, team red and blue advocate for roughly equal amounts of violence, and accounting for and evaluating each and every form of aggression, weighted by the vitriol of their demeanor in doing so is a fool's game that does nothing to reduce actual public sector crime.\n\nHowever, when one team is clearly advocating for drastically more state violence, (which is rare, I grant) we should participate in every way we can.  While the election itself might not be the sole factor, it always is a factor, and sometimes, speech alone is not enough.  Speech is important, but if the liberty movement at large is united against such a politician, I would support ads against them.  Maybe that's just me. Who said anything about right and wrong?\n\nVoting is aggression.  You are lending what the state thinks of as credibility or a mandate for it to do violence.  It does not, and should not matter what X group of people want you to do or think (liberty movement or otherwise). There's a couple of rothbard quotes on why voting is morally acceptable but I'm currently on my phone.  His basic premise is that we live in a matrix of coercion and that therefore, it's okay to vote for a less cruel master. Why would an anarchist want to participate in elections or care who wins them? Which is exactly why nobody serious with politics cares about anarchist political philosophies.     It's better to support politicians that would move the government towards more liberty than to sit on Reddit all day and do nothing. There are probably more effective ways but every little bit of progress helps. It's better to support politicians that would move the government towards more liberty than to sit on Reddit all day and do nothing. There are probably more effective ways but every little bit of progress helps. That it the mentality of an abused spouse. People outside of the abuse can see that the victim simply needs to get out of the relationship. That's not a good comparison. The abused spouse can actually get out if they wanted to. We can't opt out of the government if we want to. As long as we are forced to live under their rule it makes sense to do everything possible to change it towards something more freedom oriented until it's possible to get rid of it completely.",

    "snippet" : "  Quote from a thread on 4chan.\n\n&gt;His intentions, if you read the manifesto, is not to \"exact vengeance\" or \"do what's right\" - he's doing what's wrong and acting out so that the media will report it and people will pay attention - so that his accusations and appeals he made numerous times before he did this would be heard.\nHe's doing what's wrong to show what's wrong with the LAPD. He isn't killing people he thinks are bad, he's simply trying to hurt the LAPD as badly as possible. And he is. Fucking with their families, guard duties, hourly check-ins just to make sure their officers are alive. He's running 100+ officers all across Big Bear even though the LAPD doesn't think he's there- but they have to look because it's their freshest lead, and it's cold as fuck, up there.\nHe's draining their resources and exhausting their nerves. LAPD has assaulted 3 separate vehicles just because they thought it might be Dorner - 3 victims I know of are suing over the matter. As he says he wants an investigation into his discharge and the fact that he claims the board members were friends with Evans - more importantly the larger issue of the \"blue line\" and corruption resulting from the department silencing whistleblowers just to cover themselves.\nThing could really improve if those claims are taken seriously instead of focusing on \"he's a bad man who kills people he's wrong and what he says is evil\" - that's what the media has been saying all the while ignoring the transgressions of the LAPD and frankly I find it disgusting.\nThis can be a device of real change and justice, let's not get caught up in petty squabbles of ad-hominem attacks or fanfare or gun-control debates.\nI ask you this as a citizen under the jurisdiction of the LAPD.\n\nI see this as infighting between thugs. People that don't like me are killing each other. I don't really care how they resolve it, but I hope there's not much more collateral.  Those are obviously just /b/ trolls and the reporter took the bait.  Just look at the [facebook cover] (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chris-Dorner/122595954585025) for proof. I wonder how many of those are /b/ trolls and how many of them are \"normal\" people who actually agree with the message. After reading his manifesto, I can't tell if he's crazy, or very, very smart. If he planned to take views such as being pro-gun control and to praise both democrats and republicans, the media can't peg that as his main motive. He's either very confused in terms of his political opinions, or he is just very smart in laying out a narritive so people can't call him a crazy gun nut, left-winger, right-winger, etc.., and instead they actually focus on the real issue; corruption in the LAPD. He's smart in the subjects which he is most closely exposed to. Facing concrete reality is usually the best way to have sense knocked into you. He knows the corruption of the LAPD because he has experienced it firsthand.\n\nThe rest of his opinions seem much more detached from reality. They're still in abstract \"political\" space - something discussed on CNN and voted on in November. He hasn't seen the direct effects of citizen disarmament because he hasn't lived through any overt infringement on his liberties by the federal government, so he can afford to be wrong on those subjects. He's enjoyed his privileged position as an agent of the state in the naval reserve, so he doesn't know what it feels like to be on the shitty side of that divide.\n\nI don't think he's crazy or very smart (in terms of the political strategy in writing the manifesto). He's just expressing himself honestly and without an agenda. The simplest explanation is the best in this case I think. He's a normal pro-state drone, like the vast majority of the population, who has had the privilege of witnessing the state's corruption in one very isolated domain, and now he is taking action in that domain.

After reading his manifesto, I can't tell if he's crazy, or very, very smart. If he planned to take views such as being pro-gun control and to praise both democrats and republicans, the media can't peg that as his main motive. He's either very confused in terms of his political opinions, or he is just very smart in laying out a narritive so people can't call him a crazy gun nut, left-winger, right-winger, etc.., and instead they actually focus on the real issue; corruption in the LAPD.  I do not support warfare except in self defense. Whether a state or an individual declares war. Lust for vengeance does not justify bloodshed.  True. But the circumstances bring up a good ethical question.  What do you do when the other side doesn't believe that as you do?  Case in point, the LAPD response to this incident.  Shooting up the pick up truck of 2 women?  Telling people not to wear hoodies on the streets?  They clearly lack your ethics and have proven their own corruption and disregard for human life. True.

Their punishment must be proportional to the amount of unfair advantage they gain over another. \n\nThe state is a huge advantage, so IMO they're too dangerous to allow them to live. Any lesser form of justice would be insufficient to prevent them from abusing that kind of power again, since there is currently no way to neutralize their ability to do harm to others. \n\n\n\n\n\n You've got to be careful not to identify the state as the people who currently hold power, though.  If some psycho detonated a bomb on capitol hill and wiped out most federal politicians, the system is so constituted that a new crop would likely be elected before long and begin the same crap all over again.  The system itself must either be dismantled or made unworkable to stop the state.  Simply punishing, by whatever means, those who have committed atrocities in its name solves nothing. It would seem so, but that very logic undermines the concept of justice to begin with. One could just as easily say that a new batch of criminals will inevitably take the place of the current batch, so why bother?\n\nWhile I wouldn't advocate roasting the whole nest because some of them are not wholly dedicated to violence, attempting to bring one of them to justice will inevitably drag the rest in, so the effect is equivalent: the state must go.\n\nThe reason they win by default is because with them the many will protect the few. It's a losing proposition for us so long as we are diffuse and have no loyalty whatsoever to each other. They have no command of honor, strength, integrity - all they have is a pact amongst cowards to gang up on the lesser number. Our weakness is what gives them strength.\n\n“Our doubts are traitors, \nand make us lose the good we oft might win, \nby fearing to attempt.\" - Shakespeare.\n\nThat's the only reason I would advise against it; not because some moral principle is compromised. You make a good point.  It just seems to me that worrying about punishing government criminals is like treating the symptoms and ignoring the underlying disease.  Once the disease is cured, then any remaining symptoms can be treated.  Similarly, once the apparatus that gives these people their power is taken from them, then they can be tried for their crimes and punished appropriately. I do not support warfare except in self defense. Whether a state or an individual declares war. Lust for vengeance does not justify bloodshed.

I think his ultimate point is that success is more than passively sitting in a school. &gt;Can you really say that a college education today guarantees success?\n\nNo, but you can demonstrate that a college education tends to be a good economic decision (for most schools, at least)--even when you consider opportunity costs and assume the education to be financed.\n\n(*See Bloomberg's [piece](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-09/college-roi-what-we-found) on college's ROI and a school-by-school [breakdown](http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/colleges_return_on_investment.html).*) almost a quarter of the schools showed a negative ROI. I am surprised though by the ROI of the top schools. It would seem that if you're going to go to a top school, then it would be worth it. \n\nHowever I do question correlation is causation. I suppose if you are capable enough of going to a top school and starting your own business, I question whether there is a need to attend college at all. I'd be interested in seeing if those college names actually got someone higher pay for the same job or perhaps it was that certain jobs were unavailable to people of lesser schools? I know for the jobs that I apply for, that the pay rate is determined before anyone knows what school I went to, so I wonder how that dynamic works. Admittedly I didn't go to a top school. Maybe the top schoolers get taken off to the side during a job interview and shown the \"real\" pay scale and not what was advertised to the general public?     Very well put, and artistically moving. I love in the beginning how he mentioned the idea of college leading to a stress-free life.

    "title" : "Shit My Neo-Con Dad Says: A Question on Open Borders, Immigration Policy, and the \"Maintaining\" of Democracy",
    "snippet" : "Today I was having a discussion with my Neo-Con father. \n\nMy father is a man that believes that democracy in America should be \"protected\" at all costs. Due to this, he supports policy such as the banning of the right to vote by anyone that doesn't have a job, since \"people with jobs are the main taxpayers in this country and have the largest economic stake.\" He also supports very strict border regulation. He believes that only people with a high school education and pro-American sentiment should be allowed into America (not really specifying how this policy can be implemented). My father went on to explain how if there was a national referendum tomorrow on banning Muslim immigration, he would support it - explaining that if a majority of Muslims moved into this country, they would enact Sharia Law and it would be the end of Democracy as we know it. During about 1 hour of discussion/argument, I constantly explained to him how this is the folly of Democracy, and the fact that stricter border regulation would mean depriving people like my grand parents from coming into this country.\n\nI've searched around this sub trying to find good posts on immigration and open borders and what not, but I haven't found much. \n\nWhat is your opinion on my dad's beliefs (specifically the Muslim thing). What aspects of Libertarianism/An-Cap support the deregulation of borders, and what is the argument for deregulated borders? \n\nFinally, i've heard discussion on this sub and on /r/Libertarian that arbitrary borders oppress the people. Could you elaborate more on this point? \n\n**Edit:** I want to add that he quoted the Libertarian Party's Platform\n\n&gt; Economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders.  **However, we support control over the entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a credible threat to security, health or property.**\n\nAnd he used that as support for his stance against Sharia Law and what not.  So your Dad only wants to be subject to rules that support his beliefs and not be controlled by those he feels seek to destroy his way of life? \n\nIf only he could think of a solution that doesn't involve more strong-arming.  The founding fathers only allowed rich white men to vote, and supported restricted borders in order to protect the culture of the United States. Maybe your dad is an OG constitutionalist? OG?  As Milton Friedman said, you can't have open borders in a welfare state. It's simply not sustainable. So in terms of \"real world politics\" I agree that there has to be some kind of border regulation.  Would you support restrictions if there was no welfare state? no, not at all. So how do you respond to his argument of having a bunch of people from religion or country X immigrating into the country and democratically instituting policy Y that undermines you and a large portion of the country? &gt; democratically instituting policy\n\nWell, *there's* your problem. So how do you respond to his argument of having a bunch of people from religion or country X immigrating into the country and democratically instituting policy Y that undermines you and a large portion of the country?  Your father is right about a few things. Imagine if tomorrow America joined every other country in the world in a \"global democracy\". What do you think the constitution would be like? What would be the first laws enacted?\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is the logical conclusion of rejecting global democracy, and [it implies restricted residency](http://strangerousthoughts.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/on-home-and-property-freedom-of-immigration-in-a-private-society/).         It pretty much comes down to this. Do governments have the right to restrict the movement of people (and you could spread this philosophy to movement of capital as well). The time of highest growth in this country was when we had the most open immigration. \n\nWithout our former very-lenient immigration policies, how many of us would actually be here? Would your dad be here?\n\nAlso about your father's fear about Sharia and the end of Democracy. What if there was no state through which to enact Sharia? ;) \n\nSo basically, the main argument for deregulated borders, is that immigration is a natural right.\n\nThe Libertarian Party stance you posted has to be clarified. They support unrestricted movement, and that means no immigration quotas, no minimum savings requirements, and no 15-20 year waits and other draconian policies.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbHvP9CTjvA ",

    "snippet" : "  This guy blows off the way that the pharma industry is effectively a patent cartel, and how they use the FDA to create massive barriers to entry to lock out smaller competitors.    This isn't even a conspiracy, everything they do with patents and the FDA are right out in the open.   There is absolutely zero doubt that FDA regs, and the massive patent portfolios lock out competition.   In fact, countries like India didn't have the same patents or regulations, and for a while the pharma industry, and R&amp;D over there boomed, and they were arguably making better medicines at a cheaper price than the west. &gt;... they were arguably making better medicines at a cheaper price than the west.\n\nThere are very good generic drug manufacturers in North America.\n\nThe real question is where companies choose to invest their pharmacology R&amp;D dollars and why. (The implicit question being: when you have competing regulatory and IP frameworks, which are the most effective at fostering innovation?) &gt;there are very good generic drug manufacturers in North America\n\nIn order to produce asprin in the U.S. that's chemically identical to any other asprin you have to spend 10-20 million dollars over years proving the effects of your asprin are the same as any others and another 100 million dollars building a facility that's up to FDA code. \n\nI could literally produce asprin in my basement and verify it's purity with a GC mass spec at a local college and have it be just as consistent, but not legal to sell. \n\nIn Chile it costs under 100 dollars to get certified to produce pharmaceuticals, it's optional, it takes less than a week, and the burden is on them to prove your drugs are unsafe. \n\nGuess where it's cheaper to produce generics.\n The cost of producing generic drugs is only important if someone is inventing drugs.\n\n&gt;The real question is where companies choose to invest their pharmacology R&amp;D dollars and why. (The implicit question being: when you have competing regulatory and IP frameworks, which are the most effective at fostering innovation?) I dare you to make less sense. Why ever would the cost of producing generics be unimportant in any situation? I didn't say the cost of producing generics is unimportant.\n\nWhat I am saying is that the *more* important question is which system is better at fostering innovation. &gt;The cost of producing generic drugs is only important if someone is inventing drugs.\n\nYou did, if it's only important if one condition is being fulfilled than it's unimportant if that condition is not being fulfilled. \n\nSecondly, who died and made you the final moral arbitrator of import? \n\nFor example, regulation on producing generics is important to me because my friend's grandmother needs a medicine that has relatively low demand and she needs to get it through medicaid. The producers in the U.S. can't recoup their investment selling the stuff, and producers in other countries can't sell to the U.S. because they need to comply with U.S. regulation if they want to sell in the U.S.  &gt;... if it's only important if one condition is being fulfilled than it's unimportant if that condition is not being fulfilled.\n\nYou may want to reword this so that it makes sense. I have no idea what you mean.\n\n&gt;Secondly, who died and made you the final moral arbitrator of import?\n\nObviously it's just preferences either way.\n\nThere's a balancing act to be had between fostering medical innovation and the distribution of care. And while I think it's important to reduce the costs of available treatment, I also think we need to worry about continuing pharmacological R&amp;D.\n\nUnless you're happy with the number of diseases we've cured, I think the importance of innovation is incredibly plain to see. Reworded into logic statements. \n\nP IFF X \n\ngiven !X therefore !P \n\nSuch that X = drugs are being developed \nand P = The price of generics is important\n\n\nIn the second section I think you're falsely conflating intellectual property and regulatory barriers to entry. The costs of Phase III clinical trials and meeting FDA standards for production facilities are barriers to entry and have little if anything to do with intellectual property and innovation.

Kind of a blessing, tbh.\n\nThe first step in becoming a self-made individual is slaying your heroes.\n\nI slayed Rothbard a while back; it's been RP's turn for a while, but he's put up such a good fight since, the limey bastard. I don't think slayed is the best word here. How does one \"slay\" Rothbard. I don't mean to inflate my own \"magnificence\"; even pointing out the flaws of Rothbardianism doesn't grant me an overall prestige over his own life work, but his deontological moralizing is easy to refute.\n\n*The Ethics of Liberty* isn't taken seriously by many philosophers of ethics. It's on my shelf but I've yet to read it, what's wrong with it. From my understanding he just shows the contradiction of anything other than self-ownership. I may be wrong on that though. I still don't think it justifies the word slay though, even if his deontological ethics are flawed I still agree on principle. And in a utilitarian way I would want as close to a Rothbardian system as possible. And the nature of the problem is very different, here Ron Paul is being hyprocritical and somewhat of a betrayal, Murray never did anything like that. He may have made some logical errors , but he was not a traitor. It's just a saying. \"Kill your heroes\".\n\nDon't idolize.\n\nIt's not to be taken literally.

And the nature of the problem is very different, here Ron Paul is being hyprocritical and somewhat of a betrayal, Murray never did anything like that. He may have made some logical errors , but he was not a traitor. It's just standard Natural Law.  It and other ethical schools, like Objectivism, suffer from the is-ought problem and human relativism.  I am not aware of anyone who has ever been able to solve it.\n\n&gt;And in a utilitarian way I would want as close to a Rothbardian system as possible.\n\nI agree this is probably so.  I do happen to believe though that consequentialism inculcated into the human organism deontological ethics, not that it's \"objectively\" valid.\n\n&gt;Murray never did anything like that. He may have made some logical errors , but he was not a traitor.\n\nEh, I was more just saying being able to see the flaws in who you admire; it doesn't imply you are 'superior' to such persons, whatever that means.\n\nBut, this ability, whether it be the intentional goal of an actor or not, inoculates one from seeing whoever inspired them as infallible and puts them more on check to liberally cross-examine whatever enters their mind, be it from someone they respect or not.  Too many take what Rothabrd said as synonymous with 'the correct position'.\n\nI can't speak to notions of 'betrayal', but I can say Rothbard would've rejected me from associating with him merely for being a skeptic of his ethics. I like to look at it this way, it's your choice whether you ought to be a good person and adhere to ethics or not, he just lays out the only way for ethics to work without being in contradiction or leading to chaos.\n\n[Here](https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=48) is an interesting article by David Gordon that talks about Ethics of Liberty.\n\nAnd what about Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics that is supposed solution, [Here's](http://mises.org/daily/4629) an article Murrary wrote on it, I've yet to read it. But it's not like he just wasn't aware of the is-ought gap. I don't think slayed is the best word here. How does one \"slay\" Rothbard. What do you all think about this?

But Rockwell ??? Unbelievable that this username was not taken. I find it free to use almost on every site. It's fun to have the same user name where ever I go.

    "snippet" : "Why do so many ancaps analyze the state as a collective force? It is so clearly a force created to take, secure, and protect private property and the elite that claim its ownership, that I have to wonder if your analysis includes history at all. \n\nSomebody brought up why things that don't hurt other people are illegal (example used was marijuana), and the highest upvoted responses were along the lines of democracy is mob-rule.\n\nHow does this mesh with reality? People were never opposed to marijuana until private interests made it illegal and created smear campaigns.\n\nI have even seen people on here attribute racism to collectivism, as opposed to white private property owners who owned slaves creating racist laws and deliberately aggravating tensions between poor white people and people of color.\n\nYou all seem to be opposed to democracy when direct democracy is very clearly the antithesis of private rule. But I'm starting to find that none of you are opposed to private rule, as long as it is accomplished with contracts and capital.\n\nI mean even welfare was created to secure private interests. Every single program like this was created to placate the working and impoverished classes to keep them from seizing private property.     &gt;Why do so many ancaps analyze the state as a collective force?\n\nWhat else would it be?\n\n&gt;It is so clearly a force created to take, secure, and protect private property and the elite that claim its ownership\n\nThis does not contradict your previous statement. The state can be both a collective force, and one that takes, secures, and protects private property.\n\nBeyond that, I do have one problem with this analysis. How can one both \"take\" and \"protect\" private property? By taking private property, you are stealing, and cannot be protecting the private property.\n\n&gt;How does this mesh with reality? People were never opposed to marijuana until private interests made it illegal and created smear campaigns.\n\nEvery interest is a private interest, so I don't quite understand what you mean by this. The legal opposition to marijuana happened precisely because democracy made it easy for people to enforce their social doctrine. People would most likely not take someone to arbitration for smoking a plant if they personally had to do it (in a general sense, there are exceptions).\n\n&gt;I have even seen people on here attribute racism to collectivism\n\nWhile it is always important to keep blame on the committer, it is also important to understand why things such as racism occur. I prefer a cultural explanation, which might be the collectivism that you are referring to. Imagine being raised in an environment where slaves were raised to be subservient and thankful for the life and wealth that their owners were giving them. Not only this, but the slave owners were also raised and taught that they were giving their slaves a better life that they could not achieve as a free man because of their savage nature.\n\n&gt;I mean even welfare was created to secure private interests. Every single program like this was created to placate the working and impoverished classes to keep them from seizing private property. \n\nSame as marijuana, democracy makes it easy people to enforce their social doctrine. Markets make it harder.\n\nI like to envision the nature of state power as a feedback loop. Parents, schools, culture in general teach kids that they must have a state for various reasons, this creates a legitimacy for the monopoly on force, which enacts policy that often reinforces the parents, schools, and culture in general. This feedback is what makes the cycle so hard to break. &gt; What else would it be?\n\nA private one. When was the last time you or me were allowed to shape any part of the state, except which puppet working for corporate interest we wanted?\n\n&gt; How can one both \"take\" and \"protect\" private property? By taking private property, you are stealing, and cannot be protecting the private property.\n\nHuh? It's quite simple. One takes property. Then one protects it with an army and a legal system around \"private property. I never said the property was private to begin with, although I see how it could've been implied. Lets remember the indigenous people who did not claim private property, and had the land they were occupying and using taken in the name of private property. Have you ever studied history and the motivating force behind basically every war? Its the desire to control property and the resources on it, and it isn't for the people, but for the ruling class.\n\n&gt; Every interest is a private interest, so I don't quite understand what you mean by this.\n\nExcept for food, water, and shelter. Those interests are pretty common.\n\n&gt; The legal opposition to marijuana happened precisely because democracy made it easy for people to enforce their social doctrine.\n\nWhat?

The land was not taken away from them in the name of \"private property\", but simple governmental expansion. You seem to be defining \"private\" to be governmental, and then wondering why we all think private property is distinct from the state. You're using a very perverted definition. In the case of what I would call private property, the people who would enforce my right to it are me and the society I live in (that also respects private property). But a government is not a society.\n\n&gt; Except for food, water, and shelter. Those interests are pretty common.\n\nCommon to individuals. You and I don't like the same food or drinks. Each of our desires are individual desires, literally by definition. Just because multiple people desire the same thing doesn't change the fact that these desires *come from* individuals.\n\n&gt; It was made illegal, attempts to democratically change this were then met with state resistance, violence, and ad campaigns to change public opinion.\n\nTrue. But it was made illegal by **democratically elected** officials. Sure, they were influenced by other special-interest groups, but doesn't that show what a bad idea state democracy is? That money can buy majority opinion, and that majority opinion is backed with lethal force?\n\n&gt; What are you talking about? You did not address what I said about slavery and racism ...\n\nI'll address it. Here's a quote by Rand on racism that I like:\n\n\"Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’s genetic lineage—the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.\"\n\nShe - and we - ascribe it to collectivism because it's a cultural consequence of failing to look at individuals, and instead focusing on groups of people. The white property owners were acting in a collectivist fashion. You can own property and be a collectivist, you'd just be a hypocrite. And these slave owners were hypocrites.\n\n&gt; I can't even follow what you are saying. ...\n\nHe/she's saying that majority opinion backed by a force perceived as legitimate is a good way to enforce social doctrine. But you're absolutely right; it's even easier in more restrictive states. That's why democracy is so lauded today. The problem is that it's still backed by coercive force. A free-market society, in which majority opinion is **not** backed by anything but each person's ability to enter into voluntary contracts, is a society in which trying to enforce a universal doctrine is even harder (impossible, if not everyone actually agrees with the doctrine in question).\n\n&gt; When have we had democracy?\n\nWe have it now. The issues you see with it are inherent to democracy.\n\n&gt; Do you understand what democracy is?\n\nYes. It's when each person has an equal say in the government. In our case, it's a representative democracy, so each person has an equal say in who the elected officials are. Which is true. The problem you seem to have is that corporations can pay for large amounts of advertising, so it appears as though money literally buys votes. But it doesn't. You're mad that people are dumb enough to go along with it. And they are. Just don't pretend that democracy isn't the issue.\n\n&gt; It isn't two wolves and a sheep deciding what to eat for dinner\n\nThis is exactly what it is. In a country of three citizens, democratically run and state-enforced, a vote on what to eat for dinner could be two votes for the sheep and one vote for a salad. Enforcing the legitimacy of majority opinion, the two wolves eat the sheep. &gt; Yikes. The land was not taken away from them in the name of \"private property\", but simple governmental expansion.

Does the state have a private property monopoly on all the land within it's borders, or does it not? &gt; A private one.

It isn't two wolves and a sheep deciding what to eat for dinner like the email your grandma sent you said.     If the people are easily susceptible to propaganda (they seem to be) then direct democracy is a terrible idea. \n\n Here I was thinking that the opposite of authority was democracy. I mean lets look at a decision making process that the state has nothing to do with. Hanging out with your friends. Do you decide what you and your friends are going to be doing together? Or do you all reach a decision democratically? Let's say a group of 4 girls and 5 guys are hanging out together.  The 5 guys vote to go to the strip club.\n\nDo they force the 4 girls to tag along?  Or are the 4 girls allowed to go to the coffee shop? No. They don't have to go in this example. If you force them, we have a case of kidnapping, not democracy.\n\nIdeally though democracy is consensus. The further away from consensus, the less democratic. Your example is hardly democratic because the majority is slight. Let's say a group of 4 girls and 5 guys are hanging out together.  The 5 guys vote to go to the strip club.\n\nDo they force the 4 girls to tag along?  Or are the 4 girls allowed to go to the coffee shop?  &gt;none of you are opposed to private rule, as long as it is accomplished with contracts and capital.\n\nYeah, I could agree with that. Contractual obligations have to be kept, yeah. And \"capital\" doesn't sustain itself in a free market if it doesn't serve other individuals' needs - that's why it supports the state, because *then* it can survive while being inefficient.\n\nIf you want to call that \"private rule\", I'm OK with that. &gt; Contractual obligation have to be kept, yeah.\n\nThe emancipation proclamation is signed. I am a \"freed\" slave. Due to racism and my economic condition I have no other choice but to enter indentured servitude.\n\nYeah that contract is totally legit, and upholding it is more moral than breaking the terms the second I get a chance.\n\nThats an interesting take on ethics. Slavery is a statist problem. In a free market, labour gets its fair price, like any other good. You did not address the ethical question. Also you have no proof that slavery is a statist problem as opposed to a private property problem. Are you saying that an indentured servitude contract is not valid in an ancap world? &gt; Contractual obligation have to be kept, yeah.\n\nThe emancipation proclamation is signed. I am a \"freed\" slave. Due to racism and my economic condition I have no other choice but to enter indentured servitude.\n\nYeah that contract is totally legit, and upholding it is more moral than breaking the terms the second I get a chance.\n\nThats an interesting take on ethics.  Your thesis seems to be that we have private rule right now in the West. How would you contrast those states with all-out monarchies then? What's the difference? The difference is in how much democracy there is. A dictatorship obviously has no democracy, nor does a monarchy. A western republic where the entire \"democratic\" process is decided by those in power, and in which the pool of people to vote for are already approved by those in power, is slightly more democratic than a monarchy, but still not very democratic. Let's say we had full direct democracy. There is a national vote on whether or not to ban drugs and it passes with 80% approval.\n\nIs this democratic?\n\nWhat if only 50% showed up to vote? I don't think a national vote is my idea of direct democracy. I am coming from an anti-state perspective as well, so direct democracy works best when it is decentralized. But by decentralized direct democracy, you mean that e.g smaller communities or workplaces should implement mandatory democratic management, correct?\n\nOtherwise you're saying that we are against the very idea of people coming together to decide on something. You are in the case of it conflicting with private property, or am i missing something?  ",

Can anyone who has read it confirm this? I'm honestly not sure how he got that from this book. Would you like to offer evidence to the contrary? He didn't offer evidence for his point, merely a statement of opinion. My statement of opinion in response is that I'm not sure how he came to that conclusion based on what's in the book, and elsewhere, that it makes me think he didn't actually read it.

It mentions monarchy a few times, so it is an apologia for monarchism?  Interesting, then, that the main \"argument for monarchy\" he gives is that the people would resist a king more than a democratic government that supposedly \"represents them\". Well, I would say that the *main* argument is the one of economic incentives (that the king treats the realm like private property). He also tries to argue in favor of closed borders and restricted immigration with an \"economic\" argument, even though every school of economic thought currently embraces free trade.\n\nHoppe's views are far out there for the Austrian school.

You can say that about genetics if you want, but if you want to denounce the skills I have, then you're attacking me as a person. &gt;you're attacking me as a person\n\nNot meant as an attack, just an observation. If you perceive observations as attacks, I'm sorry. Nevertheless, I fail to see how my snarky reply is irrelevant as the representation of what Hoppe writes is contingent on precisely one's ability to understand what is actually written.    You can say that about genetics if you want, but if you want to denounce the skills I have, then you're attacking me as a person. Not at all. Reading comprehension is essential to understanding hoppes book. If you don't have good reading comprehension than you are a bad judge of what the book is about. Take the reverse of this. You read the book and everyone thinks your analysis of what takes place in the book is incredibly bad, therefor you have bad reading comprehension. Not an ad hominem.  How is saying I can't read not an ad hominem? It has nothing to do with my arguments. Because we are talking about a a book. I'm starting to agree with them since you've been told several times that people aren't making ad hominems against you, yet you still make this claim. \n\n**Not being able to read has everything to do with your argument when you are talking about a book you read.** That doesn't affect my argument. You are trying to dismantle me, not my argument, when you say that I can't read. For all you know, I may have **heard** all these things and not read them, or in addition to having read them. Are you kidding me? I seriously question your reading comprehension if this is your representation of Hoppe's work. Offer some sort of counterpoint, not an attack.

I was really hoping for a discussion of the book to grow out of at least this post if not anywhere else in this thread but it kind of turned into a shit-show.  frowny face. It comes with the idealism. Eventually we all sort of mellow out and find less to argue with each other about.\n\nThe book is okay I suppose. I'm definitely glad I bought it and read it, and I always reference it when I want to say that democracy has no time preference and thus consumes all it can in the short term. The rest of the book though, is far out there for any school of economics ever, and reads more like a political treatise in favor of monarchy as a \"it's the best we can do\" thing. He argues some weird things, specifically opening the immigration chapter by saying he wants to prove that closed borders and restricted immigration is not at odds with classical liberalism.\n\nInteresting book, but ultimately it's neither Austrian nor anarchist in my opinion, and it's this single book that is why I don't consider Hoppe to be an Austrian. An anarchist, maybe, given that anarcho-monarchism *can* be compatible with anarchy, but this book doesn't jive well with anarchism in some chapters. Holy crap, you really didn't read it.

I don't think id describe myself like that. I'd say I'm a scientist who simply defines my terms. My definition of morality is: opinions about what behavior is preferable or not. That is moral nihilism.\n\nMoral nihilism doesn't preclude personal preferences; all it does is swear off the presumption that one knows what is objectively valid.\n\nBut, many nihilists use such language as you've employed; there's grief and then the realization that one makes for oneself his own meaning. When it comes to preferences and opinions, yes indeed. Nihilist is a strange word though, because it has a connotation with existence, I think.\n\nOf course morality does not exist, only objects with location exist. It's easy to understand that morality is a concept. What's tougher to grasp is that the only objective definition possible for morality is: an opinion. &gt;Nihilist is a strange word though, because it has a connotation with existence, I think.\n\nWell, of course, but why do you find that strange?

Maybe we should compare ;lifestyles. My household is 5: we share bedrooms (i.e. no privacy) and we have one car. How does that compare to your lifestyle?  Well, what is your household income? Is the cost of living in your city relatively low or high? Do the members of your household have debt? Perhaps for 5 people your household income would be considered more of a lower-middle class situation. \n\nI would have considered ourselves middle class. Some of us had school loans. I didn't have a car; the other two parked on the street. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that, let's say a married couple with one kid earned 150k per year and had earned a similar income for the last 15 years. They would have a much different lifestyle from mine. They would be wealthier. This situation is very comparable to mine because there are 3 members in each household.  I don't understand why you would say a married couple with one kid would be wealthier, besides the fact that they were working longer than you. Your choice to take on a student loan is still a reflection of your wealth, just spread out over time. You have plenty of square footage to live in and freedom to do a lot of leisure activities. \n\nI think what you're doing is translating \"per household\" income to mean \"per individual\" income. You look at your $50k and compare it to $150k. Obviously there is a difference. My point is that if you look at what your roommates are really doing, you have just as much leisure as a family making more. You don't see it, because your roommates aren't fully sharing with you, but examining everything should show equal amounts. \n\nI mean the money buys the same amount of gas, food, movie tickets and video games. The difference is that you each split them by 3, whereas a family forces it's members to share. You have more freedom in many ways though, because you have a choice of what to eat or do independent of your roommates, whereas a family is obligated to all eat the same and do the same activities. The biggest differences between 3 young professionals and a family are (1) that kids are cheaper than adults, and (2) married couples split resources. Kids don't need cars, smartphones, alcohol; kids eat less food; kids don't go on dates. Also married couples do activities together so they split gas and parking; they are more likely to cook at home;  they share a room and bed. \n\nAn even more stark contrast would be 4 people each making 25k/year and one married couple with two kids making 100k/year. Both have a household income of 100k, but again I would say the married couple would have a noticeably higher standard of living.   &gt; I would say the married couple would have a noticeably higher standard of living. \n\nI disagree. Well, I disagree in that you're ignoring the children. Sure the parents individually are better off than the 25k people, but the children are worse off than each of the 25k. Together (parents + children) their freedom of choice and lifestyle averages out. \n\nLet me ask this, would you trade places with one of those children? You make $50k/yr currently, would you consider your life improved by having a family making $150k/yr adopt you and you living the lifestyle of a 8 year old? I doubt it. So my point is that a household income is not the same as an individual income. A household income implies sacrifices amongst members, which you don't really suffer under currently.\n\nI personally look at the lifestyles of my coworkers without children and I am a bit envious. they are buying man toys (e.g. home gym equipment) that i could never afford. &gt; I disagree. Well, I disagree in that you're ignoring the children. Sure the parents individually are better off than the 25k people, but the children are worse off than each of the 25k.

You make $50k/yr currently, would you consider your life improved by having a family making $150k/yr adopt you and you living the lifestyle of a 8 year old? I doubt it.\n\nThis is a bad comparison. I have much different tastes from an 8 year old. There are also biological differences between me and an 8 year old - I require more food, for instance. But, I wouldn't have minded being an only child in a household that made 150k/year when I was 8. Assuming the parents are moderately generous, that 8 year old is much better off than are most 8 year olds.\n\n&gt; So my point is that a household income is not the same as an individual income. A household income implies sacrifices amongst members, which you don't really suffer under currently.\n\nAn 8 year old who doesn't have a car isn't making a sacrifice. Also, married couples who share a bedroom aren't making a sacrifice - they enjoy sharing a room. Many couples have a spare room, but still sleep in the same room because they enjoy each other's company.\n\n&gt; I personally look at the lifestyles of my coworkers without children and I am a bit envious. they are buying man toys (e.g. home gym equipment) that i could never afford.\n\nNow this changes the number of people in a household. Obviously, having children is more expensive than not having children. &gt; Now this changes the number of people in a household. Obviously, having children is more expensive than not having children\n\nthats kinda been my point. These numbers are per household, not per individual. So when you see a household income of $150k, it's probably not too different a lifestyle than what you have currently.  My original point is that people generally think of \"household income\" as synonymous with \"income of a nuclear family.\" But, because young professionals tend to live together, they will have a high household income, but not a matching lifestyle to a nuclear family with the same income, as kids are cheaper than adults. \n\nAgain, from my observations, nuclear families (let's say 2 parents and 2 kids) have a better lifestyle than 4 single individuals, if each house has the same household income. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?  Yes, the graph is misleading, but I don't think he's accounting for inflation. He claimed that middle income is the same today as it was 40 years ago. Factor in inflation and the middle class is moving into a lifestyle that is worse than it was 40 years ago. So while it might not be reflected properly in this graph, I still believe there is an income gap.\n\n What do you mean by \"income gap\"?\n\nHouseholds make different amounts of money. Also there isn't a bimodal distribution as the graph makes it seem.  The gap between middle class and upper class. This might not be a defined limit, but it seems that the middle class isn't keeping up with inflation. Now if you showed me that the rich upper class weren't keeping up with inflation, then I would have to admit I was wrong. So as it stands right now, my evidence is a based solely on a stagnant middle class and the assumption that the inflated currency is going to the upper class. In absolute terms, the middle class is definitely better off today than they were in previous years. Let's compare the standard of living of the middle class today to that of the middle class in 1950:\n\nToday most \"middle class\" people want cable TV, Internet, one smart phone with data per person, a computer per person, cutting edge health services, microwaves, and the ability to eat at restaurants. People seem to be able to acquire almost all of those things. \n\nIn 1950, none of those things existed, except for restaurants, which were much less common. People were expected to eat at home every day. 1950 was before \"modern medicine.\" In 1950, being middle class meant having a house and a car. And I agree, the cost of housing had gone up. But, living the lifestyle of a middle class person in 1950 would be very inexpensive, and we would probably consider it to be more of a lower class lifestyle today.\n\nTwo more points: (1) I don't think it is worthwhile to compare the middle class to the upper class and (2) non-Western countries have seen even greater gains (Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, etc.)  By viewing things in absolute terms, then it's to be expected that the future will be better than the past. I think the question is whether some are getting a larger proportion of the gains than others. Therefore we need to examine the relative gains of the upper class to the relative gains of the middle class. I haven't looked at the data yet, but I'm willing to bet that the rich are wealthier today than they were in the 1950s, as compared to the increase of the middle class.\n\n&gt;  I don't think it is worthwhile to compare the middle class to the upper class\n\nkinda the whole point of an income gap. The purpose being that those at the top exploit those at the bottom. \n\nIf you're going to say that slaves should be happy with what their masters give them, then obviously there is no point in examining inequality. \n\n&gt; non-Western countries have seen even greater gains \n\nI completely agree! Thats another facet of the problem. The west uses the violence of trade laws (e.g. petro-dollar) to exploit the 3rd world. I think we should expect the same disparity in improvement here as we see within a single country.  &gt; By viewing things in absolute terms, then it's to be expected that the future will be better than the past.\n\nYes, but your original assertion was that \"it seems that the middle class isn't keeping up with inflation.\" That is a statement of the middle class over time, and so I showed you how the middle class is having a better lifestyle over time.\n\n&gt; Therefore we need to examine the relative gains of the upper class to the relative gains of the middle class. \n\nWhy do we need to examine this data? What would it prove?\n\n&gt; I haven't looked at the data yet, but I'm willing to bet that the rich are wealthier today than they were in the 1950s, as compared to the increase of the middle class.\n\nAgain, this is really hard to compare. The rich in the 1950s didn't have the internet. The rich in the 1950s didn't have laptops or smartphones. Are you just talking about the ability to buy a commodity? i.e. Are you asserting that now the rich can buy more bars of gold, gallons of gasoline, acres of land, etc.? You must define how you want to compare the rich's wealth over time.\n\n&gt; If you're going to say that slaves should be happy with what their masters give them, then obviously there is no point in examining inequality.\n\nThis is completely irrelevant.\n\n&gt; &gt; non-Western countries have seen even greater gains\n\n&gt; I completely agree! Thats another facet of the problem. The west uses the violence of trade laws (e.g. petro-dollar) to exploit the 3rd world. I think we should expect the same disparity in improvement here as we see within a single country.\n\nI am confused. You seem to say that non-Western countries have seen the greatest gains in wealth. However, you also seem to say that we exploit them, so they are not actually gaining. Could you please clarify? &gt; Why do we need to examine this data? What would it prove?\n\nIt's my belief that the middle class is experiencing the same rate of increase in lifestyle as the rich.\n\n&gt; Are you just talking about the ability to buy a commodity?\n\nI would expect the 'income gap\" to show itself in anything we examine. For example, your original claim is that are 30% (arbitrary number) more comfortable today than the 1950s, so I would say that the rich are 50% more comfortable on the same same. This would show that the current system disproportionately rewards the rich.\n\n&gt; You seem to say that non-Western countries have seen the greatest gains in wealth\n\nSorry, I must have mis-read your comment. I thought you were saying that western countries have prospered more than the 3rd world over the past 50 years.\n\nI disagree with you that the 3rd world is \"catching up\" to the lifestyle of the western world. Sure their lifestyle may have improved, but compare the number of computers and leisure time of the US to almost any 3rd world country and the difference is like day and night.\n\n-----\n\nI'm rather surprised that you don't think that the rich exploit the surrent system. Do you feel that they are just negatively portrayed by the media or what do you think is the reason they are looked at as exploiting the system by people like me? &gt; &gt; Why do we need to examine this data? What would it prove?\n\n&gt; It's my belief that the middle class is experiencing the same rate of increase in lifestyle as the rich.\n\nThe previous statement contradicts the following statement:\n\n&gt; I would expect the 'income gap\" to show itself in anything we examine. For example, your original claim is that are 30% (arbitrary number) more comfortable today than the 1950s, so I would say that the rich are 50% more comfortable on the same same. \n\n.\n\n&gt; This would show that the current system disproportionately rewards the rich.\n\nI do not understand how someone can be \"disproportionately\" rewarded. In free trade, party A and party B make exchanges that benefit each one. If the trade didn't benefit party A, then party A would not make the trade.\n\nThose who earn a lot of money have just shown that they create a lot of value. Steve Jobs and Apple made fantastic products so they were proportionately rewarded. Steve Jobs also made a lot of money by starting Pixar. He was clearly a talented human being and was paid on par with the value he created for others. Now that markets are global, rather than regional, people can reach a greater number of customers so they will earn more money than similarly situated people in prior generations.\n\n&gt; I disagree with you that the 3rd world is \"catching up\" to the lifestyle of the western world. \n\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Singapore, parts of China,  all went from being third world countries to first world ones. They are no longer third world. How are these countries not catching up?\n\n&gt; I'm rather surprised that you don't think that the rich exploit the surrent system. Do you feel that they are just negatively portrayed by the media or what do you think is the reason they are looked at as exploiting the system by people like me?\n\nI do not know what you mean by \"exploit\" the system.\n\nThe wealth gap is just a matter of supply and demand. Few people can start companies, while all able-bodied people can clean floors. Few people have the training to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers, but anyone can cook. As markets become global, more and more labor will be sent to countries in which labor is cheap. If people don't want to do X job for Y dollars, then they don't have to do it. &gt;&gt; Why do we need to examine this data? What would it prove?\n\n&gt;&gt; It's my belief that the middle class is experiencing the same rate of increase in lifestyle as the rich.\n\n&gt; The previous statement contradicts the following statement:\n\nI need to proof-read more. I mean that the middle class are NOT experiencing the same rate. \n\n&gt; I do not understand how someone can be \"disproportionately\" rewarded. In free trade\n\nWe don't have free trade though. It's controlled by the rich. For example, try not buying a GM car and the government will tax you to bail out GM. Thats not a free trade, you're buying a GM car one way or another.\n\n&gt; Those who earn a lot of money have just shown that they create a lot of value. Steve Jobs and Apple made fantastic products so they were proportionately rewarded.\n\nPlus they also secured their market share through government patent laws. Apple products aren't really worth 20% more than the rest of the market, they have that because of artificial scarcity. If I was allowed to build a duplicate of their products, then their profits would drop.\n\n&gt; South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Singapore, parts of China, all went from being third world countries to first world ones. They are no longer third world. How are these countries not catching up?\n\nBecause they're working in a factory while you and I work in a nice office cubicle. They have the american lifestyle that was 50 years ago. \n\n&gt; I do not know what you mean by \"exploit\" the system.\n\nTake the GM bailout I mentioned above. Can someone in the middle class screw up their job and as a result get a bailout to avoid being fired?\n\n&gt; Few people can start companies, while all able-bodied people can clean floors. Few people have the training to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers, but anyone can cook.\n\nLet me ask this, why can few people start companies? Isn't it because government regulations hamper people? Why can't people become doctors, lawyers and engineers? Isn't it because of licensing requirements.\n\n&gt; If people don't want to do X job for Y dollars, then they don't have to do it.\n\nIn the other thread you said you were making $50k/yr. Why don't you become a doctor tomorrow and make $250k/yr? I believe your point here is that there is nothing stopping people from doing this right?",

So what are some an-cap/voluntaryist solutions to this sort of thing? Instead of threatening violence/imprisonment/death, what can be done to give a disincentive to would-be road go-ers that don't resort to aggression? I've been drinking, but off the top of my head...If road owners deemed it unsafe to be on their roads, they could charge a higher price to use it. Kind of supply and demand- most people don't want to drive in really, really shitty weather, so people that decide to have to pay more because the road is not getting used. It's a price deterrent, but it would also help \"safety.\"\n\nAnother thought might be that private road ownership would be much better prepared to deal with shitty weather than public roads. I've lived my entire life driving in the snow from October-March, and the government has always done an incredibly shitty job of cleaning the roads. Even with 36 hours notice of a horrible storm. Recently, it took my 4.5 hours to drive what's usually a 2.5 hour highway drive because the plow trucks were not out. There was 2 days notice we were going to get slammed. Completely unacceptable. It doesn't matter though, because the state gets our tax dollars no matter how well they perform. I did have the option of getting off the highway and taking a numbered, local highway back home but it wasn't in any better shape. Pit those two road systems against each other, and it becomes a race to see who can keep the road clean so they can cater to more customers and garner a larger market share.  So what are some an-cap/voluntaryist solutions to this sort of thing? Instead of threatening violence/imprisonment/death, what can be done to give a disincentive to would-be road go-ers that don't resort to aggression? Tell them there is a high probability they could die if they go out during the storm. If they ignore that and get into trouble then that is their problem. They knew the risks and went out anyways.\n\nIf roads were private, the owners could simply refuse to let people use the roads.  This is the sort of response when I give that kind of argument:\n\n*\"Sounds good until a driver crashes through your living room because they figured they were just risking injury to themselves. I'm sure auto insurance agencies would just be thrilled to have drivers doing that sort of thing too. Or anyone with a genuine emergency who doesn't get helped in time because a vehicle flipped and is blocking the road. The personal liberty you are defending involves more people than the individual who wants to drive in a blizzard.\"*\n\nAlso, as to the private road argument. Most roads are property of the government, correct? If they are their property, does that not mean they are allowed to set the rules for them and enforce those rules? This is the sort of response when I give that kind of argument:\n\n*\"Sounds good until a driver crashes through your living room because they figured they were just risking injury to themselves.

People with genuine emergencies could go to prison. I think was he was doing was making an exception for emergency vehicles (police/ambulance/fire).  These officials think that people are smart enough to understand the threat of imprisonment but not smart enough to understand the threat of being trapped in a blizzard slowly freezing to death. Or is it that law enforcement is there to create consequences in situations where there are none in reality? Maybe if they just charged people for pulling their asses out of a snow drift and privatized the whole she-bang then the insurance companies would be on the ass of anyone stupid enough to go out in weather like that: under threat of increased premiums or not covering the cost of having your life saved, after all no one is under any obligation to help people who go out in blizzards. That way people who have the right gear to drive in a storm can be unmolested by authorities.  ",

That is not a violation of the NAP in my opinion because he is fighting for certain freedoms, though knowing he will never get it, fighting to the death. Personally i'm rooting for him, to be blunt anyone killing cops is ok in my book. What are your thoughts?\n\nP.S. My brother is a cop, and as much as i would hate for him to die, i couldnt blame someone for killing him in most circumstances and he knows this and accepts it.  I would   *like*   to like him but he's killing family members.\n\n That's where it gets sticky for me. I don't see how someone who threatens innocent children will ever be considered a hero. It's a shame, because if he stuck to the cops plenty of people would be rooting for him.  You people are all insane if you think this just. How on Earth can you possibly condemn all cops to death, presuming their guilt, yet stand dignified in vilifying the state for doing the same (NDAA). And is it not a collectivist lie to assume that all cops bear the same weight of guilt? Especially when their actions are not out of evil desire, but out of the necessity to feed their family. And we must remember that ultimately we must convince others of freedom's supremacy and the anarcho-capitalistic society as the ideal achievement of freedom. Does praise of the slaughter of human beings, even those confused into criminal acts, promote the ideals of peace and liberty? I think not.\n\nWhen we condone this sort of violence, we stoop to the state's level. All cops have the option to fire their employer for asking them to do something immoral but they would rather collect a bigger paycheck for ruing innocent peoples lives. They are the worst type of criminal because they actually believe what they are doing is right, and if you convince them otherwise they will say exactly what you said, that they have to feed their family. I didnt know \"police officer\" was the only job they were allowed to have. You're still presuming guilt for all cops. There are actually a lot of good cops in this world. Yes, I agree they work for an evil institution, but that does not necessarily mean that they themselves are evil men. I know there are many bad cops, but you cannot extend their actions upon all those in the same occupation.\n\nWe will never see freedom by hating cops and celebrating their deaths. The only way we will ever see freedom is through knowledge and its dissemination. In all likelihood we will never see freedom anyways (at least not in our lifetime), so it is simply not worth it to hold such hate against people. If anything, I pity cops. Even if they do act honorably in their profession, they'll be fighting their entire life for something they believe to be good, but they'll actually be fighting for the opposite. It's a life of deception. That's a terrible thought. Well I do not believe their lives forfeit and I will do everything I can to show them what I have found as truth. Truth is what will set us all free, not violence. All cops are guilty by the very nature of their occupation and the violence they enforce.\n\nDoes this mean they deserve the death sentence? Maybe not, but all acts of force against cops are inherently non-aggressive, and an act of self defense.\n\n&gt;There are actually a lot of good cops in this world. Yes, I agree they work for an evil institution, but that does not necessarily mean that they themselves are evil men. I know there are many bad cops, but you cannot extend their actions upon all those in the same occupation.\n\nI understand why you would want to perpetuate this myth. But it's simply not true. The vast, VAST, majority of state policemen are bad people. I've met many, and know some personally. Never once have I seen one with any rigorous attempt at virtue. Most are insecure egotistical monkeys who masturbate to their own power, whether they put it on display or not, it happens in their mind. Why do you think children so often want to be police officers? Is it because they honestly want to help people? No, they even at a young age perceive a police uniform as a symbol of power, and it attracts them. No good people are attracted to a job as a state police officer.  Is an act of self defense inherently good?  I just want the guy to live so we can hear his side of the story fully. Sadly I think everyone knows this probably won't happen, as seen by the shooting of other peoples vehicles thinking it was him. \n\nNot anyone that kills a cop is okay in my book. That is kinda messed up dude.   I don't like vigilantism. I think all acts of justice should at least be attempted through legitimate means. \n\nI don't know much about the situation though. I don't know if the individuals deserve what they're getting, if the vigilante is motivated by just actions, or what the final result will be. \n\nIt is only acceptable to kill in self defense and to punish murderers. I find it hard to say seeking out targets to kill really counts as self defense, and clearly not all cops are murderers. \n\nIt appears there will be further rights violations in the future as they attempt to stop him, any realist will tell you that antagonism will only encourage greater retaliation.  What's considered legitimate and what's vigilantism in your eyes? Common definition holds that government maintains a monopoly on legitimate use of force and anything not done by government is vigilantism.\n\nI think any just and proportionate retribution for crime is legitimate. This can be done by either the victim or the victims representatives. But many would call this vigilantism. Currently the government holds a solid monopoly on law enforcement, but I don't think it would be hard to distinguish between legitimate courts and the alternative in a stateless society. It depends on the legal procedures they follow, and how the other courts treat their precedent. In general, if the other courts find your court a valid source for case law then I'd say it's legitimate.  First, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you say something is illegitimate, you would imply that it's criminal.\n\nUnder what justification could an individual seeking retribution for his crime be considered a criminal? Yet some 'recognized' legitimate force not be?\n\nIf your law has different rules for different actors, it denies the equality of individuals. I don't consider vigilantism necessarily criminal, but I don't consider it necessarily lawful either. I believe criminals must be provided with the option to defend themselves legally, and the proper legal procedures should be followed to ensure an orderly and just determination. Vigilantes can accomplish these things, but they're generally not. \n\nIf one does not follow the proper procedures an appeals court can throw out a previous decision, so if a vigilante does not follow proper legal procedures I can't say their action was entirely lawful. Any legal system must protect the rights of victims as well as criminals. \n\n**Basically,** if a vigilante can prove they were justified in their actions we can say they acted justly, but if they can't prove it to a degree the courts find necessary we *must* treat them as a criminal. But if they can prove it I don't see why they didn't use the courts in the first place.  First, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you say something is illegitimate, you would imply that it's criminal.\n\nUnder what justification could an individual seeking retribution for his crime be considered a criminal? Yet some 'recognized' legitimate force not be?\n\nIf your law has different rules for different actors, it denies the equality of individuals. Very well said. There's no reason an individuals actions should held to a different standard than a \"DRO's\".\n\nThe word \"legitimate\" raises alarm. I don't like vigilantism. I think all acts of justice should at least be attempted through legitimate means. \n\nI don't know much about the situation though. I don't know if the individuals deserve what they're getting, if the vigilante is motivated by just actions, or what the final result will be. \n\nIt is only acceptable to kill in self defense and to punish murderers.

I am very glad to hear that you are putting these principles to work in your own life, making a real change. I do this as well and understand the difficulty that you face in these decisions.\n\nDo you mind me asking you what influences brought you to the conclusion of applying principles to your personal relationships? I find this to be exceptionally rare in the Libertarian community. By far my biggest influence was Stefan Molyneux.      I agree with you. I'm confused as to why you're on the fence about anything. He's a folk hero now.\n\nI have heard very little about him, but the disturbing part is that I think he might have killed the daughter of a cop. That seems unfair initially, but frankly she (and all of us) are complicit to one degree or another. \n\n* The man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors. - Thomas Jefferson  How is she (and all of us) complicit in the crimes of police? If this girl he killed did not herself commit any acts of aggression for which proportional retribution would be death, then he is a murderer. * If you see your neighbor being attacked, do you believe you have any obligation to help? It might be nice, but = not an obligation we will agree.\n* If you see your neighbor being attacked and the attackers are your employees, do you believe you have any obligation to help? In this case, you are complicit with your employees for the attack.  * We do agree, nice, but not an obligation.\n* If a thief steals your money and uses it to commit a crime are you complicit? If he claims this is payment for his services as an employee, but then proves the lie of this by forcing you buy his labor with the threat of violence, does this change the nature of his theft or other crimes? So the question is: am I responsible for my employees actions if he forces me to pay him what I promised? I have two responses to this.\n\n1. Him acting as my agent isn't contingent upon how or if I have paid him properly. What if I hire an assassin to kill you, the plot is foiled, but I never actually paid him since it was contingent upon his success. Am I complicit?\n2. We receive benefits from the police actions. I don't mean security, but many people receive social security payments, free education or welfare. Not all of us receive a net benefit (over what we paid into the system), but those that did are receiving the spoils of the violence. 1. Yes, and this is in no way analogous to the situation we're discussing. In our situation, the assassin has turned his gun on you and demanded that you order so many hits.\n\n2. Receiving benefits from violence is not an act of violence. Often it's something the recipient has no control over. If an individual advocates, lobbies, votes for violence, then you have an argument. But simply passively gaining benefits from such acts does not make someone an aggressor. And certainly not an aggressor against whom proportional retribution would be execution. I agree with you.

It never would have happened because there was no market pressure to do it, the upfront cost was too great, and the risks could not be justified to any corporate board. There's nothing wrong with that, because those same things that prevent private industry from building the Internet allow them to capitalize and innovate *on* the Internet in a way that government simply can't. But public universities and government agencies are the ones who have historically built these things.\"   Internet would exist if government didn't build it. Ask your friend if there are noticeable differences between output of scientific and technological advance from comparable private universities vs. public universities. \n\nAlso your friend literally took 4 specific examples that government did and then said historically governments have done these things. Your answer should be yes, yes they did, because they did it first. Then you go and look up the plethora of private market innovations that have occurred in the world. It's complete fallacy.   The distinction between public and private universities really doesn't matter in this example because almost every university receives federal money in some way. For example Harvard, a private university, is the largest recipient of federal research dollars. Typically, the universities with the highest amount of federal research dollars have the highest outputs of scientific and technological research. If you're interested, the CBO has recent publication about the role of [federal support for academic research] (http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41895.pdf). For example, in fiscal year 2008, the federal government provided around 60% of all funds for academic R&amp;D. &gt;The distinction between public and private universities really doesn't matter because almost every university receives federal money in some way.\n\nIt's not the private universities fault that the government has made it near impossible to have a university without receiving public money.  Internet would exist if government didn't build it. Ask your friend if there are noticeable differences between output of scientific and technological advance from comparable private universities vs. public universities. \n\nAlso your friend literally took 4 specific examples that government did and then said historically governments have done these things. Your answer should be yes, yes they did, because they did it first. Then you go and look up the plethora of private market innovations that have occurred in the world. It's complete fallacy.     The simple answer is: the market would have performed those feats or developed those technologies if and when they were pertinent.\n\nAlso, there are private satellite companies.  The limits to rocketry and the internet are actually most government monopolies.  You can't just launch a rocket into space in most countries -- you have to get licenses.  Additionally, most telephony systems are regulated as local monopoly grants in most places.  You can't just lay your own internet -- it's illegal!\n\nFor instance, there is little or no pecuniary value in visiting the moon.  On the other, hand there is little or no pecuniary value in climbing to the top of Everest, and yet such tourism does occur.  Eventually, there may be moon tourism, or some other reason to go.  There might be some other value in going to the moon, but right now, at $10,000 to $20,000 per pound to go there, I think we'd be hard-pressed to find a reason to do so. I'm still not sure going to the moon is pertinent, even today. What exactly did we gain besides a big nationalistic boner?                ",

    "snippet" : "Do you think that limited government is a step in the right direction? I've several other ancap friends and I'm sort of in the camp that with our current government system, we are closer to a total collapse and reboot and limiting government is kind of a step backwards. My friends on the other hand think that limiting government can help though. Just wondering which view is the dominant view between ancaps.   Limited government would be nicer, certainly, but what history has demonstrated is that limited government is an oxymoron. Governments are never limited and ignore any restrictions placed upon them.\n\n\"But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.\" - Lysander Spooner  Stefan Molyneux argues that limited government is not good, because it creates prosperity, but there's still a state. So if the state extorts, say, 5 % of income and the economy isn't doing particularly well, that's not a huge amount of money. But then the freer market creates prosperity, and then 5 % is suddenly a huge amount of money. What happens with that money? It's spent to increase government. Unless of course you actually manage to restrict the government, but I don't know of any example of this ever having worked.\n\nSo limited government may be good in the short term, but possibly catastrophic in the long term. I think he got that from Hoppe. I think he got that from Hoppe. I think he got that from Hoppe.   No matter how philosophically pure-hearted you are I defy anyone here to not be pragmatic when faced with the possibility of a limited government as opposed to having no government never.\nBasically, any step in the right direction is just that, a step in the right direction. As long as voting is not compulsory, I won't vote. Does that count? If I am *coerced* to choose between large or small government, I suspect I will choose small, but if it's up to me I won't support *any* government of *any* size.

Outside of deontological debates babysteps are the only realistic option to drift more towards the ideal anarcho capitalistic society you imagine, altough personally believe that something like a pure libertarian society isn't possibly by default of the human nature. Every system humans have came up was always a patchwork and compromise between the different interest groups. \n\nNow for Anarcho Capitalism I think babysteps are not even beginning to describe what's neccessary to reach it. Even if the government should collapse tommorow and reset (highly unlikely in my opinion) you'd just get another government arise out of the ashes. Why shouldn't it? Most people are not even aware of the existence of AnCap and most of the people who are aware of AnCap are utterly opposed to it. Do you think those people are now going to subscribe to the idea of liberty or do you think they would demand for a strong leader to lead them out of the crisis? You have to show them that AnCap can work and you can only do this step by step. You are not throwing a child into the ocean to teach it to swim.

Catalan has spent his life living in Spain and San Diego and has a strong Spanish Accent. Bagus is from Germany but was educated and teaches in Spain.

    "snippet" : "And I don't mean the nonviolent criminals that are arrested for drugs. Those aren't criminals. I mean murderers, rapists, and serial killers. How would an an-cap society face those issues? I've just been pondering the idea for a bit, and I couldn't think of anybody but police locking them up in jail. But an an-cap society doesn't support the jail system, right?       Please see what I posted in a previous thread on how anarcho-capitalists justify prison sentences and prison labor:\n\nThere are several competing hypotheses of how anarcho-capitalists will deal with prisons. The first is that a polycentric legal system will emerge (i.e. a recognized legal system in each society). Assuming barriers to movement between societies is sufficiently low, and that open land exists to charter a new society, *all* individuals living in a given society would have entered into a true social contract with that society. Therefore, each individual would have consented to the society's legal system and so the prison sentence is voluntary.\n\nSecond, the natural rights camp asserts that the NAP is not violated if you use proportional force. Therefore, jail time is proportional force for a crime.\n\nThird, if all land is privately owned, everyone in the society would \"ban\" you (and those who continue to interact with you) so would become a prisoner on your own property or a designated area for outcasts. Once a sufficient time period has passed, you will be let back into society.\n\nRe: Prison Labor. Only a small quantity of prisoners exist. Sure, they could perform tasks at below market rate. However, they would still have a living wage. See this [Bolivian prison](http://alternativegovernance.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/san-pedro-prison-2/) in which the inmates support themselves and settle internal disputes without the assistance of guards. I think this is what anarcho-capitalist prisons would likely become. Wow, first really good answer. Thanks for the info. ",

I also want to point out that this is not a post 'How will X be done in AnCapistan?'.  I want to start a general discussion on the theme of debt.\n\nHere are some question I am thinking about right now. With how much of a persons property or even life is a person liable on debt. How will debt collection work the giving up of the property is not voluntary.  Will it all be contract bases, in the sence that in the contract you write down that the money is owed and that the liabilty is all the property of the owner at this point in time, or maybe at the point in time when contract is forst broken.\n\nIs it ok to demand future income stream? Would that have to be in the contract, as in I agree that I will pay back this debt even if I have to give up all but X$ per month.\n\nHow much will be reputation based? I think today it would be quite easy to have a generall database of who owns who and make that (sometimes) publicly visible. As in that it is harder for you to go into contracted if you have defaulted befor and that you still have outsending debt. We already have that in modern society but it clear does not get used as often as I would imagen it in AnCapistan.\n\nAnother thing is standards, or common law. If you go into debt contract is is assumed that if you default you have, from that time on live on a reduced standard of living.\n\nI know that this is not really clean thought im producing here but I wanted to hear some thoughts on the subject. Also it will be intressting to see if the book will change my view on any of this.   ",
