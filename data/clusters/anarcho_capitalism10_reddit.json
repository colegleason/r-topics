    "title" : "You own yourself.  Does Self Ownership mean the body is physical property of \"the soul\"?",
    "snippet" : "Answering this question:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/17tiz4/gonna_get_downvoted_but_genuinely_want_to_see/\n\nGot me thinking about property, which I understand to be basically:  apply your effort to natural resources to improve upon them, the result is your property. \n \nThinking about the body in that light, your physical person comes from applying  effort to natural resources to improve upon them as well.  Your body uses food to grow/develop from zygote onwards, so anything after the \"gift of life\" is a product of your effort, conscious or not.  \n\n\nslight tangent: \n\nIf you do nothing to improve upon yourself someone (most likely \"the state\") will challenge your claim of ownership and take over your life...  not sure where I'm going with this, but it is an interesting parallel, I had always thought the ownership of self and ownership of physical property were separate, but it seems that self IS physical property.  The problem is that if we treat \"property in the person\" as just another instance of labor-mixing or first occupancy, then we lose the basis on which appropriation as an extension of the self is presumed to work in the first place. The language of \"property,\" \"the proper,\" \"one's own,\" etc. suggests what the traditional property theories (like Locke's) seem to say as well: that \"property\" is initially a characteristic of selfhood, and we extend that character more or less through our actions. You *could* decide to treat \"the soul\" as the seat of \"ownness,\" I suppose, but there's no need to posit a soul to make sense of self-ownership. Why couldn't a person who believes in self-ownership as the basis of 'legitimate' property generation just look at the body as a tool and an earlier appropriation, one with which the actor commits more appropriation, like a gardener's shovel and their garden?\n\nWhy is this a problem? Well, the separation of the self and the body is problematic, unless you're already committed to some dualism. But I think the deeper problem is that if you make the \"self\" immaterial, then it is this immaterial thing which presumably labors or occupies, and that's not entirely satisfactory. \n\nUltimately, it's easiest and most consistent to say that human selves naturally appear as embodied, and embodiment involves a series of transformations that involve appropriating and eliminating or abandoning resources, and that property rights are necessary to draw an adequate defense around the developing self.  &gt;Well, the separation of the self and the body is problematic\n\nWell, surely, you can agree there are easy separations a person can make from many parts of their body without them losing who they are.  Transhumanism has a lot of fun with this.\n\n&gt;But I think the deeper problem is that if you make the \"self\" immaterial\n\nThis is completely unnecessary and semantically unuseful to do.  We exist within reality and are as much a part of it as anything else.  It's not like we are aliens from a completely different dimension, dropped into here (and even if we were, there would exist a more general reality of which we were always member).\n\nWhat is meant by us being immaterial or having a \"soul\" is that there is something inescapably and necessarily incomprehensible about what we are.  But, one need not invent something called \"immaterial\"; it's material, just it's ultimate form or class in which we wouldn't ever know to place it.\n\nIt's like the supernatural vs. natural dichotomy--completely useless semantic.  We define reality as everything that is, whether we comprehend all of it or not.\n\n&gt;and that property rights are necessary to draw an adequate defense around the developing self\n\nI just think pursuing the deontological path as a formal defense is really weak.  It's much more immediate to say, \"if you don't violate a few tenets with regard to me, I will not violate them with regard to you.\"\n\nMost humans are more than happy to enter into non-aggression pacts in the pursuit of a civil society; we're very hard-wired for it.  I don't need to struggle to write a codex on morality.  It's either don't violate my and others' 'rights' and you will enjoy them yourself, or violate them and be dealt with accordingly.  I wish people would stop confusing themselves with this Lockean theory of property acquisition. It's simple to understand its wrongness: To have **ownership**, you must have property (rights). To have self-**ownership**, you must have property (rights). Thus, to say property rights come from self-ownership is backwards. Well, that's not actually the sense of the traditional Lockean position, which really does derive property rights from an aspect of selfhood. You can choose to pursue a different approach, but that doesn't mean Lockeans are confused.   I suppose if you were to substitute the word *''soul''* with *''consciousness''*, then you're about right.  Who owns your soul?  Would that be an intangible property claim?  When the devil claims ownership over souls, is he asserting an intangible property claim (IP) and therefore an evil statist?  &gt; Your body uses food to grow/develop from zygote onwards, so anything after the \"gift of life\" is a product of your effort, conscious or not.\n\nThis issue, specifically, is why abortion is an especially controversial topic amongst anarcho-capitalists.\n\nDoes the foetus \"belong\" to the mother, because the blood and cells comprising the foetus were \"produced\" by the mother? If so, at which point does the foetus become self-owning? When it becomes concious? Self aware? Self-sustaining? Financially and legally responsible?\n\nAt what point does self-ownership become self-evident, and who owns your \"self\" up until that time? &gt; Your body uses food to grow/develop from zygote onwards, so anything after the \"gift of life\" is a product of your effort, conscious or not.\n\nThis issue, specifically, is why abortion is an especially controversial topic amongst anarcho-capitalists.\n\nDoes the foetus \"belong\" to the mother, because the blood and cells comprising the foetus were \"produced\" by the mother? If so, at which point does the foetus become self-owning? When it becomes concious? Self aware? Self-sustaining? Financially and legally responsible?\n\nAt what point does self-ownership become self-evident, and who owns your \"self\" up until that time?   I would suggest that \"self-ownership\" isn't the best way of thinking about it.\n\nI recommend the ethical subjectivist route:\n\n[Libertarianism is Not 'No Gun in the Room'](http://youtu.be/-8dZ5XIwGCY) \n\n[The Utilitarian Foundation of Morality](http://mises.org/daily/5669) by Daniel James Sanchez\n\n[Crusoe, Morality, and Axiomatic Libertarianism](http://nielsio.tumblr.com/post/12618682679/crusoe-morality-and-axiomatic-libertarianism)\n\n[Is-ought problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem)\n\nI don't believe that I can objectively \"prove\" some mode of property rights to be ethically correct. I can, however, assert a subjective preference for a society which has some particular property rights scheme (and property rights schemes are really the essence of all political debates), on the basis that it will lead to improved social cooperation and generally higher wealth and happiness.    Does it matter? We can understand and accept the concept readily enough. We don't really need metaphysics.",

    "snippet" : "As hard as it is to believe there's a lot of people that can't see how destruction of property is not a boon to the economy even after the broken window fallacy has been spelled out so many times.\n\nIt's truly one of the most pervasive and destructive fallacies in society, it's everywhere.\n\nWhen I tell the story of the baker and the glazier I've changed the story a bit.\n\nInstead of explaining that the baker was planning on buying a new suit and shoes and so on I tell the listener that the baker was planning on buying a skylight.\n\nSo before the vandal came along the glazier would have been paid to install a skylight but now he is being paid to replace a broken window.\n\nThe glazier didn't benefit from the broken window, it was a zero sum game for him but now we can *clearly see* that the baker only has a window and no skylight.  We should ban windows.  That should solve the broken window fallacy.  -This logic brought to you by pubic education. We should ban windows.  That should solve the broken window fallacy.  -This logic brought to you by pubic education. We should ban windows.  That should solve the broken window fallacy.  -This logic brought to you by pubic education.  I don't think people think in terms of total owned assets or resources, but rather think like, \"oh, this will give people jobs!\" However, the reality is they are working for something they already had.  But the story is designed to highlight that fallacy. Instead of accepting that the destruction is a loss for society people reject the fallacy (or defend it depending on how you look at it).\n\n Right, but for example, many people tend to think war leads to economic growth, and many cite WWII as an example. This is because people are manufacturing goods to be used in war, and therefore employing people, and that this is good. It would be good, if the goods being manufactured were not being used to kill people and ultimately be destroyed themselves(bombs, bullets, etc..). Many people only see employment as an issue and are blind to the fact that the produced goods are a negative to society and are always a net loss.  Could you explain me why the defaut assumption is that the baker would have actually invested his money? What would have happen if he had just taken his money and didn't spend any of but rather just sit on it? Well even if the baker hoarded his money then there's still no net gain for the economy in the case of the broken window, he's just bidding up the cost of windows and increasing the money supply.\n\nThis is a little trickier to explain but here goes.\n\nThe end result of all production is consumption, in exchange for our production we receive money which we then trade to others for their production. In the case of the hoarder he doesn't produce in order to consume, he views money itself as a consumers good.\n\nSo basically the hoarder labors to provide a service but never consumes anything in return. The bakers goods are still there, the bread is being made and sold but there's *more* goods and services available for everyone else at a *lower price* because he isn't bidding up their costs. The baker enriches all of us by producing far more than he consumes!\n\nWe're getting truly into the \"unseen\" here, which the broken window fallacy is designed to highlight not obfuscate so for a clearer view of why hoarding is not a detriment but is actually a boon for the baker and the rest of us then search for \"hoarding\" at [mises.org.](http://mises.org/) Don't forget, the hoarder also increases the purchasing power of money, ceteris paribus. Could you explain me why the defaut assumption is that the baker would have actually invested his money? What would have happen if he had just taken his money and didn't spend any of but rather just sit on it?   The only valid, if not good argument is that breaking the window will lead to spending faster then waiting for the owner of the window to spend it.\n\nThis of course only works when the money was not in a fractional reserve bank or there was no central bank that does not have some predictible spending target (NGDP or something).\n\nThus if you think overall spending matters, breaking windows of money horders might safe the economy :) Why would you want to increase spending?",

    "snippet" : "I have been thinking of ways one would be able to legally offer services for \"real money\" (ie. not fiat).  It dawned on my slow witted brain that junk silver is actually legal tender that has been removed from circulation by individuals, but in fact is still only legally worth \"face value.\"  \n\nCould one legally offer two payment options, one value in normal cash and one in \"junk silver\" face value?  Then would this allow you to report say $1.25 in income, as that is the face value of the junk silver?   I recall a man being prosecuted for tax fraud for making a transaction in gold coins and recording only the face value of the coins. But gold isn't money, coins can only be used at face value... You have a good point, but-\n\nthe State. Logic is only valid when it serves the interests of The State.  sorry to -burst your bubble- but this is not a fresh idea and it has already been tried, you can guess how the government reacted Threw their hands up in amused resignation, and walked away shaking their heads at having been outwitted, fair and square?\n\nOr did they just use the guns instead?  You mean that if I took one of my Silver Eagles (paid $22 for a 2011 series), I could barter with someone for $22 worth of food, but they would only have to report $1 in income?\n\nProbably not, because the IRS has a \"wasn't born yesterday\" policy. For example, if I sell my car to a friend for substantially less than the blue-book value in order to reduce the amount of sales tax I'd have to remit, then the DMV and IRS would go \"er... we don't think so.\" Do it enough and it'll trigger an audit.\n\nI.e.: The state would eventually notice that the market value of the goods and the sales reported are widely diverging, and they'd suspect tax evasion. So what would the response to an audit be?  Say I offered a medical service on a sliding scale and people could only afford to pay $10.  What is the difference with accepting junk silver at face?\n\nAnd if they did discover it, would they try to force taxes at their determined value for the services? &gt; And if they did discover it, would they try to force taxes at their determined value for the services?\n\n Yes, my father took over a tractor repair business for a few years, but wasn't as successful as the previous owner. The IRS judged his tax liability based on historic data and forced him to pay taxes on more income than he actually collected. &gt; pay taxes on more income...\n\n\nFuckers.. You know what else?\n\nAfter the inflated taxes were _paid in full_ the paper raj lost track of the account, sent warnings to an old address they didn't live at anymore, and after construing a lack of response as consent used their power to list all of their bank accounts and _directly debit_ what they thought was owed to them.\n\nTook months to get them to recognize their own paperwork that proved the debt was already paid and get the money refunded. Yeah, I've had 20k garnished because they didn't think my COGS should offset my gross receipts..... \n\nPut me out of business... Tyrannical bastards. We need to fucking abolish the IRS and their agents entirely. I've zero tolerance for this bullshit. So what would the response to an audit be?  Say I offered a medical service on a sliding scale and people could only afford to pay $10.  What is the difference with accepting junk silver at face?\n\nAnd if they did discover it, would they try to force taxes at their determined value for the services?

What is the difference with accepting junk silver at face?\n\nAnd if they did discover it, would they try to force taxes at their determined value for the services?    You could even write it off as a loss, difference between spot and face.  I think you mean the difference between the fiat cash value and the face cash value of the silver he received. \n\nSo the service is worth $20, but you're paid with a $1 silver coin, you write it off as a $19 loss, even though the silver value of the coin is $20.     No, sorry, won't work. Technically barter or even exchange of services *should* be taxed as income based on the value of the exchange. Nobody does it because it's stupid and unenforceable. If you were to assign *value* to something in an exchange, it would be taxed at the market value of the service/good exchanged.\n\nIANAL, i just did taxes for a while, but you may have more success offering a \"90% off pay in pre-1964 change coupon\"  You may be able to write it off the difference much like a  marketing/promo discount. \n\nAlso be aware that when you go to sell your junk silver at the local coin shop, technically you are selling a \"collectible\" and should pay the highest rate capital gains tax on collectibles and art.\n\nTheoretically and legally, you'll probably get screwed no mater what you try, the system won't allow you to get away with anything. &gt;Technically barter or even exchange of services should be taxed as income based on the value of the exchange.\n\nBut it isn't barter.  It's a monetary transaction, paid with legal tender coins worth 1 dollar by decree.\n\n&gt;If you were to assign value to something in an exchange, it would be taxed at the market value of the service/good exchanged.\n\nSurely, the State already assigned the value when it decreed them to be worth 1 dollar?\n",

If he has to lie about what Schwartz said (claiming ad hominem, where Schwartz did no such thing) to preface his argument, he shouldn't be listened to as a reliable source. I was shocked when he said this. I thought the speaker was very respectful of Krugman.  He went out of his way multiple times to say how intelligent Krugman was, but they just happened to disagree on this issue. Unbelievable he tried to twist that.\n\nAnd Krugman's rebuttal didn't make any sense. Yes there's been no rise in interest rates (because the fed is keeping it down), and not much inflation (because all the new money is being held in reserves), but there's also been no recovery! I wouldn't say there's been *no* recovery, just that it's been very slow and lackluster compared to other recessions.  Well it depends if you believe the government statistics, but lets say that's true. Then a lackluster recovery is \"overwhelming proof\" of Keynesianism and any other view is an \"expression of faith\"?\n\nOK Krugman.... Look, in our hybrid command/market economy, I'm pretty sympathetic to short-term Keynesianism. If the government has a monopsony, if there are whole industries that revolve around government spending, then *of course* the economy will improve if the government spends more. It's the long-term structural weaknesses and lack of resiliency that this creates that is the true problem.  Yeah, I agree that in the short run material wealth will increase. If I max out all my credit cards I'll be living pretty well right now, but my financial health hasn't improved at all. It is actually a lot worse.\n\nIf someone did this I wouldn't be sympathetic to them, and I'm not sympathetic to the government when it does it. Yeah, agreed. Think of it like getting sick. If you get really ill and have to go to the hospital, it makes sense for you to spend huge amounts of money to get better. But if you had engaged in preventative care and been careful, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital to begin with. \n\nThat's a pretty shitty metaphor and is by no means systematic, but it kind of makes sense? I wouldn't say there's been *no* recovery, just that it's been very slow and lackluster compared to other recessions.  Wasn't the last quarter of US GDP -.1%? Mostly due to lower military spending. Private sector (if you can call it that) growth was up I did not know military budget factored into GDP, that's interesting. I did not know military budget factored into GDP, that's interesting. Military is like millions of jobs man Wasn't the last quarter of US GDP -.1%? I would think ancaps would be in favor of cutting military spending... I wasnt aware the military factored into GDP, my bad The government is a big part of any capitalist economy. It's just counter intuitive since they don't really produce anything. He went out of his way multiple times to say how intelligent Krugman was, but they just happened to disagree on this issue. Unbelievable he tried to twist that.\n\nAnd Krugman's rebuttal didn't make any sense. Yes there's been no rise in interest rates (because the fed is keeping it down), and not much inflation (because all the new money is being held in reserves), but there's also been no recovery!  \"Paul Krugman has a Nobel Prize, which is a huge deal, but doesn't necessarily mean that he is the word of god\" - Schwartz\n\n\"Why did you try to pull credentials? I have a goddamn nobel prize, dude\" - Krugman\n\nwut?\n\nalso, \"Here are some examples of how Paul Krugman's policies don't work\" -Schwartz\n\n\"There are no examples of my policy not working\" - Krugman.\n\nis this guy deaf?  I remember this. Theres  a moment where krugman realizes this isn't a circlejerk soireé and people are going to question him, his face gets more ruddy than usual   I love how the guy praises him profusely, only for Krugman to become this whiny bitch about any and all disagreement with him. This episode perfectly shows Krugman's intellectual insecurity, pettiness and general cuntery. \"Cuntery\",\n\n*adds to bag of words*   I watched this video. I didn't understand most of it, but I did like the part toward the end where they got into it a little bit.   How can you say ad hominem after a man treats you like such a gent.    I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n what an ad hominem. 'my opponent has a nobel prize, his book is extremely well written, and he is an extremely brilliant man' is the least ad hominem thing ever said. I agree he was passive-aggressive with his ad hominems. Some compliments/criticism is fine - gets the ball rolling.  Other commenters were attacking Krugman for being pouty, etc. so I was beating back those ad hominems. That was my main aim.\n\n I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n Do you even know what ad hominem is? Do you even know what ad hominem is? I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n Ad Hominem isn't merely insulting someone. Ad Hominem is specifically attacking a person *instead* of making an argument. Ad Hominem isn't merely insulting someone.

This is not debateable.  \n &gt; This is not debateable.\n\nSorry, but that's not what ad hominem means. If Schwartz had said \"Nobel Prize winners, like Krugman, use their mantle of authority to appear as if they know what they're talking about but many times they don't. Therefore Krugman is wrong\", that would be ad hominem (although a pretty weak instance of it as far as attacks are concerned).\n\nMaking the point that having a Nobel Prize does not make someone inherently right is both true and not a fallacy.  &gt; This is not debateable.\n\nSorry, but that's not what ad hominem means.

'to the man' is what ad hominem means. He does cite Japanese and Spanish experiences as arguments for his view. These are reasonable. Referencing the nobel\n(associating it with Krugman, clearly) is a 'to the man' argument. Another words, telling a guy he's a know-it-all is not relevant to the argument, whatever the argument is. Ad hominen has a distinct meaning and usage. You are attempt to weasel the definition to apply to something it doesn't. Stop doing that. I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n To my ear, he critiqued _other people's_ assessment of the merit of specific arguments based on the arguer's _very broad, very general_ expertise (as evidenced by credentials).\n\nI didn't hear him aim that comment at Krugman, at all. I think he aimed it at Krugman, indirectly, by framing it like that. Why even bring it up?  Because a lot of political discourse consists of citing someone's credentials as if that were some kind of _nuff said_&amp;#8212;as if it were sufficient substitute for an actual argument. Got you. Krugman's argument is that the upper-mddle and below classes have been\nscrewed over is one he continues to make.  Commenters were attacking the way he\nappeared, etc. so I responded to mainly beat back those ad hominems. I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n And which type of attack would that be? The kind where he says that just because someone is a Nobel Prize winner does not make them an authority on all aspects of Economy? Yes I'm not familiar with this subreddit, but don't delude yourselves, Schwartz takes an ad hominem shot at Krugman saying, I'll paraphrase,  'The nobel prize winners use their mantle of authority...'. This is not debateable.  \n [deleted] That, while a mild slight (though justified, IMO), is not an *ad hominem*. [deleted]",

That said, they are better thought out than **most** minarchist arguments... but **most ** minarchist are less informed and than folks here.\n\nThe fact that I got everything ranging from telling me I'm an AnCap to out of context arguments against things I had already set straight is proof of the above. The only direct rebuttals were either false equivalencies or arguments that ignored that the arguments against the state were necessary to enforce law even in the context of DRO's. Also ignored was the fact that a default state is not a monopoly.\n\nWith this subreddit, it just seems as if someone wrote a REALLY GOOD article about how state = aggression and everyone bought in without questioning it ;) Forgive me for my presumptions in saying \"you'll be an anarchist\", it's just a pattern we see a lot. A great many minarchists end up here after doing their own research on anarchism.\n\nI didn't come to this view lightly, you shouldn't make that assumption.\n\nI didn't read \"an article\", I read book after book and your assertion that \"the anarchist arguments aren't well thought out..\" doesn't hold up well.\n\n\n\nMight I suggest you look at other resources than reddit before concluding that *we're* \"lazy\"? I'm sure you've read more on the subject of AnCapism than me, as likely as I've read more on minarchism than you. So, fair point there. My apologies for making assumptions.\n\nWhat I have come to understand however is that it has the same goals as minarchism, but a lot more flaws and is wary of flaws in minarchism that either don't exist or are still a problem in AnCapism.\n\nThe goals being the same between the two, based on what I know Minarchism achieves more of them than Anarcho Capitalism. You should probably know that the rest of the actually-existing anarchist movement does not consider ancaps to be anarchists.

It's quite easy to rigorously show that you can't be correct.\n\nThere are only 2 possible cases: People can opt out, or they can not opt out.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the \"service\" gives them everything they ever want from now till their dead - including health care coverage- and costs only 1$. The value of the trade is irrelevant as to weather or not it violates NAP. If the person can't opt out, then it violates NAP. No other factors are relevant.\n\nTake some time to let it sink in.

When people talk about disease eradication they often mean eradication in places like South Asia and Africa, and frankly a political philosophy should primarily focus on domestic, rather than foreign, concerns. \n\nBesides, it's impossible to determine the merit of an institution looking at a singular issue. It's like determining someone's health by only looking at their reflexes.  No, political philosophy should give every individual equal value regardless of arbitrary geographical location...

    "snippet" : "  I blame the government for allowing slavery in the first place, we would have never had such bad race problems if the government didn't allow the purchase of slaves from Africa.  From a purely academic perspective, careful how you apply the term \"allow\" in this context. Governments only create rights by first taking rights away. Strictly speaking, \"allowing\" people to purchase slaves from Africa doesn't fall into that framework.\n\nI would at least start at the point of criticizing government for assisting in enforcing illigitimate title.\n\nAs for the...\n\n&gt;we would have never had such bad race problems if...\n\nI'm with Lysander Spooner, in theory, that a possible negative side effect of the Civil War could have been that emancipated slaves were disempowered from being responsibile for claiming their self ownership. Instead, big powerful government is praised for solving a problem it created, almost as though freed slaves were indebted to their new saviors.\n\nHad instead ~~the north~~ Lincoln not used abolition as a political chess piece in duplicidious games, and education and tools of self defense^1 been employed to empower former slaves to fight for their freedom, we might see an African American culture with greater pride, and hand in hand people of equality could laugh about their fucked up and misguided ancestors together.\n\n...\n\n^1 Prohibiting education and tools of self defense are historically known as the most important steps to keeping good obiedient slaves. &gt;Governments only create rights by first taking rights away.\n\nTrue. Rights are not given by government they are inherent to people. \n\nIn fact the only legitimate excuse people give for government is the protection of rights. But if the government fails at the one thing is was meant to do it seems fair to blame it for that. \n\nThis is especially true because the government protected the \"right\" of people to own slaves.  I am not saying there definitely would not have been slavery, but I don't think it would have been that common without the protection of law. I think you highligt a core element of ancap philosophy: Why should the organisation by which we trust to protect our rights be centralized and without market competition?\n\nWithout going into detail (as I expect you are familiar with the argument) competition in authority in the world(s) of Linux and the Internet have proven to work quite well.\n\nConceptually challenging? Sure. But peaceful and ultimately cooperative? Absolutly!\n\nI see a moral imperative in working to adapt this model to ~~politics~~ eliminate politics. &gt;Why should the organisation by which we trust to protect our rights be centralized and without market competition?\n\nGreat point. I am not exactly an ancap,  but this is one of the things about ancap philosophy that made me very interested in it. I am very for decentralization and diversity in ~~\"government\"~~ rights enforcement.  \"We need an ideal ancap society today!\" (imagine in all caps)\n\nmeh\n\nbut from an academic perspective / epoispemological framework, there is a lot of great literature out there for thoughtful policy analysis. Further, if you appriach it from the perspective that we are all looking for peacnful ways of getting along with each other, and there are no significant malevolent players in the game whole end desire is chaos and suffering, it is most all quite useful.\n\nI think there is a fear that ancap = terrorist, and I find that a laughable characterization of, at least, Lew Rockwell or Murray Rothbard. Their love for humanity, in my opinion, was / is a great inspiration for their writing. I actually agree with 99% of the philosophy as an end goal, I just don't know if it is currently or ever will be feasible to have a fully free society without extremely limited government. I guess it partially depends on what you define as government. \n\nLike I said earlier: I like the idea that we should have a non monopolized rights enforcement, but I don't see that as a moral imperative. \n\nI see voluntarism and non-coercion and as a moral imperative, but I see non-monopolized rights enforcement more as a good idea. If it is workable while successfully upholding freedom than I am for it. \n\nWhich puts me philosophically as more AnCap, but somewhat minarchist in practice. Optimistically I see a minarchist state as temporary leading to something more like along the lines of an ancap society.

If we are talking about taking theory and putting it into practice, I think that just takes talking about and advocating for doing things in a peaceful way at any time and place you have influence.\n\nBut I would caution against \"getting into politics\" because in my opinion that is a sign of defeat because politics is fundamentally about violence.\n\nI think The Philosophy of Liberty puts it well when it says what we really need to do is stop asking government to commit violence on our behalf. I think that is a bit simplistic, but it really makes sense. &gt;But I would caution against \"getting into politics\"\n\nDo you mean: 1) being politically active and engaging in activism and/or voting, 2) or do you mean running for office. \n\nI think there has to be some kind of transition in politics and in peoples thinking in order to accomplish this goal. Why? Because we have government run schools and government is often considered an authority on certain information. These things make it hard to change peoples minds.\n\nI think government is best changed a local level. If for example you become a sheriff you could dictate a code of conduct for law enforcement officers so largely they did not act coercively. You could make drug enforcement at a zero priority and make sure only violent and coercive crimes were dealt with. You could keep federal agents out of the county. In this way you would provide security and rights protection for people.  From a purely academic perspective, careful how you apply the term \"allow\" in this context. Governments only create rights by first taking rights away. Strictly speaking, \"allowing\" people to purchase slaves from Africa doesn't fall into that framework.\n\nI would at least start at the point of criticizing government for assisting in enforcing illigitimate title.\n\nAs for the...\n\n&gt;we would have never had such bad race problems if...\n\nI'm with Lysander Spooner, in theory, that a possible negative side effect of the Civil War could have been that emancipated slaves were disempowered from being responsibile for claiming their self ownership. Instead, big powerful government is praised for solving a problem it created, almost as though freed slaves were indebted to their new saviors.\n\nHad instead ~~the north~~ Lincoln not used abolition as a political chess piece in duplicidious games, and education and tools of self defense^1 been employed to empower former slaves to fight for their freedom, we might see an African American culture with greater pride, and hand in hand people of equality could laugh about their fucked up and misguided ancestors together.\n\n...\n\n^1 Prohibiting education and tools of self defense are historically known as the most important steps to keeping good obiedient slaves. I'm just saying we'd be far better off if we never had a large Black population here in the first place. The very least that could have been done was the creation of an independent Black country in the American territory, or possibly more effort put into the back to Africa movement. Forced integration helped neither the White or Black population.  To my understanding, the majority of African Americans (despite controversay over how that term is used) today are not decended from slaves, but immigrants. Other than that, unless we are strictly speaking about over reach of SCOTUS, I don't particularly like the direction this discussion is going.

The very least that could have been done was the creation of an independent Black country in the American territory, or possibly more effort put into the back to Africa movement. Forced integration helped neither the White or Black population.  I upvoted your original comment, but in the back of my mind I fucking **knew** this was your real point. I blame the government for allowing slavery in the first place, we would have never had such bad race problems if the government didn't allow the purchase of slaves from Africa.   Never forget that it required violating revered concepts of private property to bring Jim Crow down.  Also, capitalism in the US was built on slavery.  Maybe keep that in mind, too.  Also, keep in mind that ancaps to be consistent would have been on the side of the property owners in both cases.

Also, keep in mind that ancaps to be consistent would have been on the side of the property owners in both cases. &gt; Never forget that it required violating revered concepts of private property to bring Jim Crow down.\n\nNo, it did not require that, but that's what happened.\n\n&gt; Also, capitalism in the US was built on slavery.\n\nNo, the real rise of capitalism came in the North, and spread South after the corporate welfare programs that made slavery economically viable ended.\n\n&gt;  Also, keep in mind that ancaps to be consistent would have been on the side of the property owners in both cases.\n\nNo, because we don't think people can be property. Our intellectual predecessors of the time were abolitionists. Actually, it did require that.  Just like it required it a hundred years earlier in the Civil War.  Capitalism in the North was not independent of the Southern slave economy.  It was vital to it.  As for the rest, anyone can say their predecessors were the abolitionists.  I would say that anarchists have the better claim to it than anarcho-capitalists.  Albert Parsons, for example, had been a radical republican and had organized against white reactionaries during Reconstruction before fleeing North to Chicago where, of course, he organized the working class for the 8 hour day and was eventually hanged for it.  Either way, at least we agree that ancaps would have been on the side of the property owner during the fight against Jim Crow.  Which would have put them on the opposing side to all the other anarchists.  Which is telling. See Lysander Spooner and Friedrich Bastiat.\n\n Spooner was anti-capitalist, as with all the individualists of his day.  Bastiat was a French libertarian. Spooner is still a moral antecedent of deontological ancaps, if his economics were lousy so what, nobody is perfect. He certainly believed that slaves owned themselves. I know Bastiat was French, that doesn't change anything, he was anti-slavery. I would say his anti-capitalism are among his redeeming qualities.  Either way, considering he printed Bakunin pamphlets, he still fits better in the anarchist tradition than the anarcho-capitalist one.  Bastiat's broken windows theory is also kind of silly.  You can have that if you want it. I love it when people dismiss the Broken Window Fallacy. \n\nI didn't know communists were keynesians. All I'm saying is that capitalism has historically accumulated through destruction, generally of the state-directed form.  Maybe there's some free market fantasy land where this isn't the case.  If there is, I haven't seen it.  I think it's just bad ancap theory. Never forget that it required violating revered concepts of private property to bring Jim Crow down.  Also, capitalism in the US was built on slavery.  Maybe keep that in mind, too.  Also, keep in mind that ancaps to be consistent would have been on the side of the property owners in both cases. &gt; ancaps to be consistent would have been on the side of the property owners in both cases.\n\nHow so?\nThe property owners would be the slaves and later the african-american freemen. just because the slave owner bought a slave from someone doesn't mean they owned the slave since no ownership is valid if non-voluntary. Word games. If that's \"word games,\" then the difference between anarcho-syndicalists and fascist nationalists is \"word games.\" Word games.",

    "snippet" : "How do property rights apply to the intangible world of the internet? If someone hacks into a website, should this be considered the same as breaking into a house, if so why? Is it possible to own something that you can't touch (especially considering the rejection of intellectual property)?\nI think this is an area that Rothbard and others haven't looked into, for obvious reasons, and we need to consider the area more.  People own private servers, which are run on real, physical computer, and hacking that and changing it in a way that the owner doesn't want is essentially vandalism. So yes, I'd say they are entirely subject to property rights and hacking could be considered aggression. so what exactly is being vandalized? Is the server case cracked? Is the monitor broken? Is the magnetism on the hard drive gone?\n\nRemember that in the traditional view, nobody can own IP, so claiming that there was a change to IP couldn't be a crime. However I am one of the few people on this subreddit that does believe in IP, so I agree that vandalism has occurred. I just think you should consider these arguments for when the anti-IP crowd comes in.  Do you own the electrons moving through your computer?  I certainly get a bill saying I paid for them.\n\nSo if someone is using my electrons in my server a way that I don't approve of.... Haha that actually does make sense. Do you own the electrons moving through your computer?  I certainly get a bill saying I paid for them.\n\nSo if someone is using my electrons in my server a way that I don't approve of.... Your electrons are still there, just like they were to begin with. You started with 1,000,000,000 electrons and you ended with the same number. Nothing has changed. lol, well you could say that's true about anything. \nIf someone eats my food and takes a crap on my carpet.  All those protons, neutrons, and electrons are all still there.  I still have them.  \n\nBut I don't really approve of how they were used by that person. &gt; But I don't really approve of how they were used by that person.\n\nI'm sure an author of a movie or a song doesn't approve of how you use their IP either. \n\nLike I said, I believe in IP. It's a real thing that people care about and they should be allowed to defend like any property. The key, as with all forms of property, is that it's the responsibility of the owner to defend, not society. That means if you wish your website IP protected, then you need to protect it yourself. Society doesn't owe you anything. Therefore if you fail to protect your property, you can't seek revenge against others. Learn from your mistake and protect your property better next time. I agree with you. So maybe we're talking about two different things.\n\nIf a user with access to your system, is actively disrupting the functionality of your system.  I don't think that is really an IP issue. It's an IP issue, because nothing is stolen or damaged by defacing a website.\n\nlets change the scenario. Lets say that you invite me into your house, but before I leave, I re-arrange all the chairs in your house. I then slip out the back door before you discover what I've done. Clearly something has changed, but nothing is damaged or missing. \n\nNow you hunt me down and drag me into the street to kill me in front of my family. The neighbors rush to my defense and ask what my crime was. You explain that I moved the chairs around in your house and it displeased you. Do you really feel your actions meet up with the crime?\n\nThats the thing about IP, it might upset someone in how it's used, but there is no real evidence of physical damage. It's the responsibility of the owner to defend his own property. If you're worried that someone will deface your website, then don't give them access to your website. If you think someone is going to resell your song, then don't sell them your song. Fair enough.  I'm with you. I'm not going to try to defend IP, when I think IP is ridiculous.  I guess I'm just unceratain on where the line is drawn between that and an actual property violation.  This is kind of where the rubber meets the road, right?\n\nYou also bring up the point, of what are you willing to do to punish for what you view as a crime.  I'm certainly not prepared to kill a person over a website.  And I wouldn't ask that the state to do it for me either.\n\n It's an IP issue, because nothing is stolen or damaged by defacing a website.\n\nlets change the scenario.

If you think someone is going to resell your song, then don't sell them your song. If someone's moves my property, say, on my lawn, then they have violated my property rights. Defacing a website means causing the disk drive on the server to have different data, which means they caused the head of the hard drive to move and also used extra electricity. However, not protecting a network may be akin to running into traffic. I agree with you. So maybe we're talking about two different things.\n\nIf a user with access to your system, is actively disrupting the functionality of your system.  I don't think that is really an IP issue.

If I break into your house and eat your bread is it then ok to then take a shit on your couch without your permission? \n\nI merely took the atoms stored in your refrigerator and re-arranged them chemically before depositing them on your couch. You have the same amount of atoms that you started with.\n\nSo you shouldn't have a problem with that, right? How is it we both came up with fecal analogies?

OK, so if changing the arrangement of atoms is what justifies retribution, then what should you be allowed to do? I posted a comment on your blog that you didn't like. The blog is hosted on your server and therefore the atoms have been re-arranged. Are you justified in killing me in my sleep? Do you burn my house down? What exactly are you justified in doing now that I made this negative comment about you? &gt; OK, so if changing the arrangement of atoms is what justifies retribution,\n\n\"Justifies retribution\"? Seems a odd choice of words. It certainly justifies seeking damages, which I don't think is exactly the same thing. \n\n&gt; I posted a comment on your blog that you didn't like.\n\nSo, what?

Previously you were claiming that I physically altered the arrangement of atoms on your computer. A simple comment alters the arrangement of atoms on a server, just as much as defacing the website does (e.g. changing the background color). \n\nTherefore what you're really arguing isn't what is physically being changed, but rather what the intellectual meaning is of your website.

Are you only reading every other sentence or something?\n\nIf I make a website publicly available with a comment system I expect people to make comments.

However I am one of the few people on this subreddit that does believe in IP, so I agree that vandalism has occurred. I just think you should consider these arguments for when the anti-IP crowd comes in.  Naw, this couldn't be classified under IP. Ideas can't be vandalized. This is about as much a vandalism of an idea is scribbling in someone else's book counts. The server itself is being altered in a way that is against the will of the owner. &gt; The server itself is being altered\n\nplease elaborate? I don't see how someone could look at the physical nature of a server and be able to see any damage? I'm no computer expert, but the way I see it as changing the way electricity flows through the computer in a way you weren't authorized to do. OK, so if I own a radio station that alters the way that electricity flows through the copper wiring in your home, how would you defend yourself from me? Yeah, probably. actually I wasn't asking if you would defend yourself, but rather how you would. Would you kill me in my sleep and when the community asked what your justification was, you'd tell them that I moved some electrons around in your house? &gt; The server itself is being altered\n\nplease elaborate? I don't see how someone could look at the physical nature of a server and be able to see any damage? When you write new data on a hard drive the surface of the disk is physically altered. Think of it like a very compact vinyl record.  Nothing is taken or left physically. The most you could claim would be that what was pre-existing there was re-arranged. This is a claim that the IP that was your website should not be altered, not a claim that anything was physically damaged.\n\nHowever just for the sake of argument, lets say that I agree that the surface of the hard drive was altered. Remember that it can be altered back just as easily. So my question is what is the level of self-defense you should be allowed to use? Could you kill me? Do I owe you all my labor for 3 years? How do you measure the damage that has been done physically?\n\nNext question. lets say that I own a radio station. Could you claim the same level of compensation for altering the electrons in the copper wiring of your home? Therefore everyone with a radio station within 100 miles owes you $1 million dollars? If I take a notebook you've written in in pencil and erase everything nothing would be taken or left physically. You could alter your notebook back just as easily. What level of self defense are you allowed to use to protect the contents of your notebook? \n\nIt's up to the third party you and I agree on to determine reasonable compensation for the unauthorized physical alteration of my hard drive, I'm sure they could figure out a reasonable figure.\n\nForget about electrons, this is about the physical surface of the platters in my hard drive.  &gt; What level of self defense are you allowed to use to protect the contents of your notebook? \n\nI could restrict access to that notebook to prevent you from even touching it. I could put it in a locked room and if you try to break down the door, I will push you away.\n\n&gt; this is about the physical surface of the platters in my hard drive.\n\nif you want to be technical, then please describe what has physically changed. I'm not sure how familiar you are with hard drives, but they aren't vinyl records. the only physical change is the polarity of the minerals on the surface. Nothing is visibly different.\n\nWhat if I write a nasty comment on your blog, are you equally due compensation? Changing the polarity of the material in my hard drive does constitute a physical change and is detectable given the proper instrumentation. If you can use physical force to protect your notebook I can use physical force to protect my hard drive. If I can't use physical force to protect my hard drive because altering its contents doesn't constitute a physical alteration I'm sure you won't mind if I use a powerful electromagnet on yours. \n\nBy including a comments section on my blog I'm authorizing you to write new data to that specific segment of the website. so what exactly is being vandalized?

Nothing is hurt, nothing is damaged, and the availability of the computer is not compromised then there is no violation. \n\nHowever, generally speaking, when people 'hack' into the computer they are doing it with the intention of perpetuating some violation.

In that case then anybody with a password does have a right to the money.\n\nBut that's not actually how it works. The password, in the case of online banking, is used as a shared secret to help identify the owner of a bank account.  It's a security feature.  Even if you do have the password it does not give you a right to that money unless you are the owner. \n\nThe fraud in this case is caused by the fact that you are pretending to be somebody you are not in order to trick a bank into giving you money that does not belong to you.\n\n&gt; If that is how you interact with the world, then you better protect your passwords. \n\nAm I somehow unique in the fact that i protect my passwords? Do you go around posting passwords to craigslist and then claim that nobody can use them because they are your IP?\n\n&gt; Using violence against me because you want an easy life where money is dispensed solely on the knowledge of a password is not justified.\n\nI wish I could justify the use of violence at people that use really terrible arguments and contorted logic... it would make these sorts of discussions much easier to stomach. &gt;  break into your house\n\nI thought we were talking about a website open to the internet, not hidden away on a computer in someones house.

Would entering a password of the administrator account be considered \"breaking\"? Does that mean you are breaking your own computer every time you log into it?\n\n\n\n Don't be silly.

I don't follow your logic. \n\nI thought I explained what would constitute damages caused by a hacked computer in the following paragraph. What physical property has the vandal denied you the use of? The physical arrangement of the bits on my hard drive. If someone disassembled my car without my permission I'd have a claim against them. They didn't deny me use of the components that make up my car and they didn't damage them yet they clearly did infringe on my physical property.  They denied you the use of your car. What is the analog in the case of your hard drive? They didn't deny me use of the car, they denied me using the car in a specific manner. I still have the car and could for instance sell it but the way I would usually use it, driving, is impossible. If for example someone deleted the contents of my hard drive I could no longer use it in the way I normally would, for instance running a blog.\n\nThis whole argument is immaterial. If someone broke into your house and did something completely reasonable like rearranging your furniture it still wouldn't be justifiable. Objecting to someone screwing around with your property is completely justifiable whether it's digital or physical and without using IP as a justification. so what exactly is being vandalized? Is the server case cracked? Is the monitor broken? Is the magnetism on the hard drive gone?\n\nRemember that in the traditional view, nobody can own IP, so claiming that there was a change to IP couldn't be a crime.

I just think you should consider these arguments for when the anti-IP crowd comes in.  Precisely.\n\nIf one looks at \"what\" is vandalized, vandalizing a magnetic signature on a lump of metal (i.e. a form) is hardly significant enough to make a claim.  Further, claims could not be made based on the type(s) of content stored; regardless of whether one \"Vandalized\" highly sensitive data that resulted from multi-million dollar investments or \"vandalized\" someone's Facebook post wouldn't be much different beyond perhaps an arbitrary quantity of magnetic signatures changed.\n\nIf someone requested I arbitrated a case over *\"several thousand of my electrons being manipulated against my will\"* I'd give them a AA battery and tell them to go bother someone else. People own private servers, which are run on real, physical computer, and hacking that and changing it in a way that the owner doesn't want is essentially vandalism. So yes, I'd say they are entirely subject to property rights and hacking could be considered aggression.  I don't think you have rights to intangible things.  The onus is on me to secure my network and to have backups if I feel they are necessary.  \n\nWith regards to homesteading, while you don't have property, you do negotiate with the community for discrete identifiable services such as IP addresses and DNS TLDs and domains.  But this is a voluntary issue.  Right now the community as a whole agrees to abide by RFC1918 which specifies IPv4 address blocks which are not to be routed across the Internet.  However, nothing prevents Level3 and Comcast from coming to an agreement to exchange 10.0.0.0/8.  Why they choose not to do so is that other ISPs likely will not choose to listen to that advertisement and it will create reachability issues for anyone using an IP address out of that block.\n\nWith DNS, we could setup our own TLD called .ancap and setup root servers and be up and running in a few hours.  I could point rothbard.ancap to your DNS servers and you'd sit and wait for traffic that wouldn't appear.  That's because we would have to convince everyone running DNS servers to point to our root server.  But there's nothing that technically stops us from setting up a competing service.\n\nThis really all comes down to a derivation of Metcalfe's law, which suggests that the value of the network increases exponentially as the number of nodes on the network increases.  Makes sense... I'd offer you $0 for rothbard.ancap if no one could reach it... make it 1/20th of the Internet and I might offer you $1 / year.  As more people can reach the service, the more demand it will create.       Oh also, how does homesteading apply to the digital world? Like, if you are using a particular domain name.  And someone else decides they also want to use that domain name?\n\nAt a certain point. It's all alive on some physical piece of property.  The ISP has a server which has a DNS on it.  When we register domains, it goes out to all every DNS so that record can be updated.  It's not a thing to be owned or to be homesteaded.  It's a service that is provided, for a fee.\n\nSame thing with hosting servers.  You could host a website from your own computer in your living room.  Or you can rent some space on someone else's computer.\n\nIn other words, it's not like land that just exists before people created it.  The digital world must be built by someone first.\n\nNow what about homesteading a radio signal.  like wifi? Or like a radio station channel? I think that gets a little more complicated. If you wanted to occupy the 2.4ghz band that 802.11g wifi lives on, but for some other purpose and you interfere or end up blocking your neighbors wifi signal.   Hmmm, then what happens? Is it stupid to suggest that this is in effect a type of air pollution? I never invited my neighbour to send his signals through my airspace. Polluting the signal?   Yeah, I don't know.  \n\nI mean, there's a similar situation for sound, and noise complaints, right? Is it stupid to suggest that this is in effect a type of air pollution? I never invited my neighbour to send his signals through my airspace.

My mind is pretty firmly made up on IP, I've heard and lived with most of the counter points but one of these days I'm going to have to read some of your stuff.\n\nYou're like a dog with a bone and I can't simply dismiss the esteemed Mr. JamesCarlin. &gt; *\"[a] My mind is pretty firmly made up on IP\"*\n\n&gt; *\"[b] You're like a dog with a bone \"*\n\na + b = ?  I think hacking (especially malicious activity) does violate peoples property and rights, but I think justice is more likely to come from the online world, than the physical one.    Keep in mind that many of the technologies used by anarchists to subvert the state online (cryptography, TOR, etc.) can also be used to cover the tracks of a hacker, which makes assigning and collecting liability equally difficult. What I find interesting is how the hackers have a social function in that they constantly seek out flaws in security, opponents constantly patch those, and that hardens the internet against state attacks.   I don't know if it is even possible to have a truly perfectly secure communication and media infrastructure, against everybody, including the state, but it seems we are being pushed toward a more prefect internet.

As an engineer, I have to call bullshit. I don't want anyone designing a building or bridge that hasn't proved themselves to be competent.

Licensing doesn't prove anything more than you have permission.\n\nTeachers are a great example. Every shitty teacher I've ever known has had licenses just like the regular and kickass teachers. Yes. But, teaching is incredibly subjective. But, engineering is not. You're trying to change the subject to an argument you think will win and I applaud you. \n\nAlso, anyone that says licensing doesn't prove anything obviously knows nothing about engineering licensing. It tests competence and requires a formal education, a long internship, and a standardized test. So, only the people that have the patience and competence to see it through are given a license. As an engineer, I have to call bullshit. I don't want anyone designing a building or bridge that hasn't proved themselves to be competent. [deleted] As an engineer, I have to call bullshit.

How do you suppose that burden of proof be met if you do not let them demonstrate their ability?\n  The man was a trained dental technician. He provided services to those who did not have enough money or access to dental \"insurance\" (which is really just managed care).\n\nI have no problem with his behavior, so long as he properly represented himself as a dental technician, rather than a trained Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) &gt; rather than a trained Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS)\n\nwait a second. Why does a title make someone better qualified? Shouldn't a more honest approach be that people shouldn't hide any poor outcomes?\n\nFor example, shouldn't this guy state I have a 99% complication free rate for filling cavities, while the average DDS has a 98%? My point being, titles don't convey legitimacy or competency. It's a false sense of security.\n\nNow if by \"DDS\" you mean there was a credit reporting agency that monitored this persons success rate and anyone with a success rate above 99% gets to use that title, then I agree with you.   I don't think biglawl is saying the titles make him more qualified. I think he's saying that to claim a title you don't have would be fraud. I agree that fraud should not be done, but I get the impression that biglawl is expecting this guy to disclose to everyone that he's a lowly technician and hasn't a formal title by his name. I think having formal names can help when describing a person in a certain profession that has several tiers. It allows for better decision making when selecting a service. I would go to that man for a basic filling or teeth cleaning, but I would not go for an advanced surgery, such as wisdom teeth removal.\n\nDefinitions do help. Unfortunately we do have a social stigma against the lower tiers, who honestly do help a lot of people, and clear up clinics. I mean, why go to a professional dental surgeon for a basic teeth clean? I don't think biglawl is saying the titles make him more qualified. I think he's saying that to claim a title you don't have would be fraud.  Historically, the implicit purpose of state backed/enforced professional licensing has been to raise the barrier of entry into a given profession in order to restrict the supply of services and raise the rates that those professions can charge.  Of course this is always done under the guise of 'public safety\". The majority of medical schools that admitted black &amp; women students were closed down in the immediate wake of the Flexner Report.\n\nIf a private institution like Underwriters Labratories is good enough to certify that the electronic device I purchase won't burn my house down, then I think private certification agencies could be replicated other professions.

Result of the study is that medical education in America needs to be standardized e.g. 2 years of scholastic education and 2 years of clinical education.

This licensing results in 50% of the medical schools closing and leaves only those associated with large public universities. Schools which admitted black students and women are among those which are forced to close. This closure and regulation of medical schools, along with government control of residency programs, is one of the main reasons why we have such a bad doctor shortage in this country.\n\nSource: I am a medical student and we are constantly told how revolutionary the Flexner report and how great it was for medicine.

OK, so my normal response is I'm against licensing and for certification, but as every non-trivial concept, this ultimately comes down to semantics. Allow me to explain:\n\nTo license means to grant permission to do something.\n\nTo certify means to assert (as a third party) that something is true.\n\nNow, for the simple case, let's assume that Doctor A owns his own property and wants to set up an office. He should in no way be required to get a license, and by definition he can't be required to get a certificate because that would make it functionally a license (also, it means we've got to establish who is requiring, which would then either imply aggression or that they have an ownership stake in A's office). However, since no one is required to attend his office, he's fine to practice on whoever comes by willingly and no one can bother either of them about it, because it's voluntary. Maybe B knew A in college and trusts him, so he drops by. For a while A does fine because he only treats people who know and trust him, and everyone else mostly stays away because they don't want to risk the fact that he's a quack.\n\nNow, this is all well and good, but to stay in business A needs more people than he actually knows to come by. So what are his options? He can spend money to advertise, and this will probably get some people to come by, but it doesn't solve the core issue that they simply don't know enough about him to trust him. His current patients could \"advertise\" for him by word of mouth and that would hopefully be better than just an ad, but it has a much smaller footprint. If only there was a way he could get someone with a lot of visibility to vouch for him. Enter the certification organization Z. Their entire job is to observe doctors and vouch for them, approving their methods. Basically, A would hire Z to come watch him work, and assuming they found him to be sufficiently competent, they'd give him a certificate that he could then display to others or include on his ads. Now even if you don't know A or one of his patients personally, as long as you trust Z then you can at least feel somewhat safe in going to A because Z trusts him. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But Z has a vested interest in making sure they do a good job verifying A because once they've given out their cert, it's not just his name that stands to be tarnished if he screws up but theirs as well.\n\nNow, the only real twist occurs when A wants to rent an office instead of operating out of his own property. After all, offices are expensive. Now, in this case, office owner D has every right to require that A obtain his permission before operating out of D's property because otherwise it would be trespassing. So in this case D could require that A get a license. But if there's no general government to license, where would this come from? Well, D could check out A's operation and credentials himself and decide if A passed muster, but D is a businessman not a doctor and probably doesn't want to take that risk (after all, if A ends up being a quack then D might lose reputation for letting him open up shop in D's property). So he's more likely to look to a certification body that already exists and get their approval, only letting A open up shop if he's certified by Z. In this case, A has been certified by Z which means that he's been granted a license by D because of the certification. This is actually what happens today with most electrical goods: they are voluntarily certified by Underwriter's Laboratory, but most places will not buy or sell electronics that aren't certified. So if Billybob wants to sell his homemade toasters from the corner of his lot that's all well and good, but most people are going to look for a known brand that they can trust despite the fact that the consumers aren't electricians themselves and can't evaluate the safety on their own. More likely that an insurance company would require him to get certification from an agency that they trust. He wouldn't be required to get insurance of course, but even casual customers might want to make sure he's covered in case some freak thing happens. More likely that an insurance company would require him to get certification from an agency that they trust. He wouldn't be required to get insurance of course, but even casual customers might want to make sure he's covered in case some freak thing happens.  The federal government has no power to require licensing for any kind of profession or other activity. Some states may have taken that power in their constitutions, but it's still wrong.  \n\nHaving said that, obviously if anyone causes injury due to malpractice, they should be held accountable. So, in your opinion, it's better to just sue for malpractice instead of attempt to prevent it? I'm an engineer and there are quite a few people that want to be engineers... but, are completely incompetent. But, they get jobs because their dad knows someone. But, they can't buy a license... which is a good thing. The risk, coupled with steep penalties, would avert much of it. Anyone can design a building, just not a very good one. Does that mean you should have to go get certified before you can design one? Does that certification need to be government approved? Does the government approval need to be at the federal level?\n\nIf someone performs medicine on a patient, and kills that patient, it's no different than if he had used a bullet or a hacksaw.  The trouble is in knowing whether he killed the patient or just couldn't save him. The certification doesn't need to be governmental. I think there should be several levels of certification to distinguish better architects and engineers. But, the wrong time to find out someone is incompetent is when their building falls down and kills hundreds of people. People will do extraordinary things hoping they won't get caught. So, your argument that fear of steep penalties would prevent someone doing something stupid is complete bollocks.\n\nAlso, for engineers, doctors, and other licenced professionals, there are, currently, massive fines levied for causing harm. So, the risk you suggest as an aversion already exists. But, it doesn't completely stop people doing stupid things.\n\nThe real problem is that incompetent people don't know they're incompetent. So, providing uniform testing helps weed them out. Let's say that an incompetent person does practice engineering or medicine. For most simple tasks they might do quite well. But, for something complex, they might convince themselves and everyone else that they know what they're doing and really fuck something up. I don't like those odds. I absolutely support the idea of certifications to show experience and knowledge of a job, as long as one is still allowed to do so without them.  Case in point:  http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/08/09/158498244/its-now-legal-to-braid-hair-in-utah-without-a-license\n\nPeople should be allowed to make their own mistakes; no amount of law or oversight will prevent all stupid actions. We're supposed to live in the land of the *free*, not the land of the *safe*. Remember how much doctors used to cost before they all had to go buy six digits of medical school? So, in your opinion, it's better to just sue for malpractice instead of attempt to prevent it? I'm an engineer and there are quite a few people that want to be engineers... but, are completely incompetent. But, they get jobs because their dad knows someone. But, they can't buy a license... which is a good thing. Who would hire a bad engineer? That's way too risky.\n\nBut how do you know if an engineer is good or not? Private certification. How do you know an engineer is bad? Semi-public certification... Did you have anything to add or are you just hoping your knee jerk response gets upvoted for having the words \"private certification\" in it?\n\nHere's an example of private certification: LEED, the standardly accepted licensing program for environmental friendliness. Basically, if you're already a licensed professional, you simply need to take a few courses and pay a load of money for your LEED certificate. Whereas, the PE licensing process (which is state run to national standards) requires a formal education, internship, and standardized testing. Can you tell me which is better or why private certification wouldn't devolve into a simple fee collection?    As already said, victimless crime. No one should be punished. Not necessarily. It could be fraud. I would say it was medical negligence, and should be treated the same as if a regular dentist had made the same mistake.  Licensing boards can take advantage of practitioners and have monopolies on professionals just like government has a monopoly on violence.  In Australia, the registration/licensing board for all medical practitioners was just combined into one giant national organization and they raised the price several hundred percent.....with absolutely nothing to show for that increase except for more bureaucracy and red tape to get anything reasonable done.  \n\nNot to mention the testing organizations required can be just as corrupt and monopolistic as government and licensing bureaucracies.  Don't like the way a certain test is administered?  \"Fuck you!  All that money (100k) and time you just spent on a professional education is worthless.\"\n\nDon't get me started on this shit.         I think ratings agencies that make their money on referring customers to dentists (and so are completely dependent on their reputation to exist) do a far better job than government licencing. If a licencing agency fucks up they still make money so they will be able to take bribes or simply save money by not spending the resources needed to keep low quality or incompetent dentists from being licensed. A ratings agency without government support does not have that option. \n\nOf course that's just the economic argument. The moral argument is that a licencing is a threat of force (extortion, kidnapping, death) against everyone. So it doesn't matter if people would be worse of when finding service provider without licencing, licencing is a bad thing in and of itself because it is violence. \n\n  Its necessary for a civilized society. Look at how things worked out BEFORE licensing.    ",

Each node is its own network that may not control another node that is its own network.

I'm interested in doing a libertarian space opera.\n\nEDIT: [Gave it my best shot](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/17oum1/explain_libertarianism_like_we_are_the_borg/c87lg9o). That is a really good point. The borg systems were distributed and non-heirarchial. It was anarchy in the most literal sense (remember that the queen and locutus were created for diplomatic purposes, helping them relate to other species, not to create internal heirarchy). Despite the fact that they worked together and had no self identity, there were no licences or ranks because every degree of autonomy in each node had was embraced; it greatly enhanced the power of the collective, indirectly.\n\nWith regard to cooperation, the hive mind and virtually instant communication and understanding ultimately made them operate seemingly as a single unit.\n\nFor ideal social evolution / progress, people should be treated the same way. This type of equality is still ideal even when latency and noise is greatly increased.\n\nThe hostility and violence of the borg were against outsiders.

Internally they were arguably the most peaceful race in the Star Trek universe.\n\nWell there's your problem. There is no \"they\" among borg. Calling them non-aggressive among \"themselves\" is like saying you're not aggressive towards yourself. Devil's advocate, the borg saw other humanoids the way we see natural resources in an ancap society. \n\nBut among ancaps, all humans are fellow borg, while traditional collectivists see other humans as a resource to be exploited. \n\nI think that as a difference. Thoughts?  So you're saying both the borg and traditional collectivists want to exploit others? I'm not sure where the devil's advocate comes in to play here.  To be honest, most things in Star Trek are absolutely nonsensical, especially from an economics/political theory standpoint.\n\nI have to suspend my ancapism to watch it.

The Maquis (Part 1 &amp; 2) in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is pretty Ancap. In fact, the entire show is pretty much about breaking down the Federation's collectivist ways. Sisko even says at one point \"The problem is Earth! It's too much of a utopia over there and over here in the wild frontier is where all the problems are!\" Something like that.  That's surprisingly tough. I don't think the Borg have the capacity to grasp the concept. Look how hard it was for Hugh to understand that he was an individual, and Seven could only do so after her human biology reasserted itself.

He doesn't even understand the arguments raised against him.  sooo... your goal here is to discredit the idea that 'intellectual property' is invalid because it violates property rights without putting forth any argument of your own?\n\n&gt; In other words, to say, “intellectual property is not property because it violates property rights” is to make a circular argument.\n\n\nIt seems that you have this backwards.  IP _does_ violate property rights.  Simply calling IP a 'right' does not make it so. \n\nAlso pointing out that somebody is capable of putting forth a flawed argument that somehow 'bodily rights' and 'physical property rights' are not exactly the same thing (which they are)  and can conflict (which they don't) does not mean that the same thing is true for saying that IP violates property rights.  \n\nSimply showing that some arguments can conflict with your argument does not mean that your argument is flawed. \n\nProperty rights have a reason to exist. They flow from the natural order of things. They serve a important purpose based on the physical realities of the universe. Just like gravity or radiation the scarcity of physical goods on this planet is a physical characteristic that cannot be changed irregardless of perception or belief system. \n\nThe same cannot be said for 'IP'.  It's up to IP proponents to illustrate why IP is a valid property right even though it conflicts with property rights.  This is demonstrably so that IP and physical property rights conflict and that they cannot coexist peacefully.\n\n 'IP is property right' _is_ the circular argument.  It's up to the IP folks to show why it is necessary and desirable. &gt;sooo... your goal here is to discredit the idea that 'intellectual property' is invalid because it violates property rights without putting forth any argument of your own?\n\nI am not sure what this means.\n\n&gt;It seems that you have this backwards. IP does violate property rights. Simply calling IP a 'right' does not make it so.\n\nI addressed this in the previous posts. What do you think of those claims?\n\n&gt;Also pointing out that somebody is capable of putting forth a flawed argument that somehow 'bodily rights' and 'physical property rights' are not exactly the same thing (which they are)\n\nThey're really not. Someone who enters an orchard I own is not attacking my body, unless you believe in some extremely fundamentalist strains of deontology which I believe would be very difficult to justify.\n\nFurthermore, calling the left-anarchist's argument \"flawed\" seems to indicate that you believe in an objective proof for libertarian property rights in bodily and physical matter. What is this proof?\n &gt; I am not sure what this means.\n\nI am trying to figure out the point of your posts. \n\nIt seems your goal is to discredit the argument that \"IP is invalid because it violates property rights\". \n\nright?  I don't know a plainer way of stating it. \n\n&gt; They're really not. Someone who enters an orchard I own is not attacking my body, unless you believe in some extremely fundamentalist strains of deontology which I believe would be very difficult to justify.\n\nSomebody that enters a orchard is not attacking your automobile. Am I to conclude then that 'Automobile rights' are not the same thing as 'Property rights' because your orchard does not involve your automobile?\n\nYour orchard is owned by you. Your body is owned by you. These are both property rights. These are both physical things you own. There is no conflict over a person owning themselves and a person owning a orchard. The distinction between 'bodily rights' and 'property rights' is really artificial and completely arbitrary. \n\n&gt; Furthermore, calling the left-anarchist's argument \"flawed\" seems to indicate that you believe in an objective proof for libertarian property rights in bodily and physical matter. What is this proof?\n\nYou have to have exclusivity of control in order to utilize a physical item.  It does not matter how choose to perceive your rights or how you choose to believe the universe functions, you can't change this fact.  Property rights merely describes the mechanism of how we are able to peacefully determine who gets to control what item at any point.  &gt;It seems your goal is to discredit the argument that \"IP is invalid because it violates property rights\".\n\nClose to it, I suppose. I am trying to refute the claims to the effect that IP is objectively unethical because of its interference with physical property. I don't actually support IP, as I said in both posts.\n\n&gt;Somebody that enters a orchard is not attacking your automobile. Am I to conclude then that 'Automobile rights' are not the same thing as 'Property rights' because your orchard does not involve your automobile?\n\nNo, just that people own both their automobiles and orchards separately. You said, however, that an attack on physical property actually was an attack on bodily property.\n\n&gt;There is no conflict over a person owning themselves and a person owning a orchard\n\nBut there is, because a person's physical body can be restricted from entering an orchard. How is this conceptually any different from someone owning a physical object but being prohibited from using it to violate some IP claim?\n\n&gt;Property rights merely describes the mechanism of how we are able to peacefully determine who gets to control what item at any point.\n\nYes, but you are advocating a particular brand of property rights, not just one which solves the \"scarcity problem\" in general. Maoism also establishes owners (namely, the State) for physical objects, but that doesn't mean it's not highly economically inefficient. &gt; No, just that people own both their automobiles and orchards separately. You said, however, that an attack on physical property actually was an attack on bodily property.\n\nNo I didn't. \n\nThe correct way to state my stance is that 'A attack on physical property is similar to a attack on your body in nature'.\n\n&gt; But there is, because a person's physical body can be restricted from entering an orchard. \n\nSo can a automobile. There is no distinction in property rights over your corporal being. It's something that you own and do with what you will. Same thing with other things you own.  They are yours to do with what you will unless it causes a conflict with other people's property. \n\n&gt; How is this conceptually any different from someone owning a physical object but being prohibited from using it to violate some IP claim?\n\nBecause when you violate a person's IP claim there is no damages caused to them or their property.  Nothing is taken away from them. Nothing is removed. You acting on information does not prevent anybody else from acting on the same information.\n\nThe reverse is not true. \n\n&gt; Yes, but you are advocating a particular brand of property rights, not just one which solves the \"scarcity problem\" in general. Maoism also establishes owners (namely, the State) for physical objects, but that doesn't mean it's not highly economically inefficient.\n\nWell I always assumed that Maoism tries to pretend that property rights are invalid in the first place, then uses this as a excuse for people in power to seize property for their own purposes and destroy people's lives. \n\n &gt;No I didn't.\n\nI may have misinterpreted this:\n\n&gt;Also pointing out that somebody is capable of putting forth a flawed argument that somehow 'bodily rights' and 'physical property rights' are not exactly the same thing (which they are)\n\nIt's just that I have heard people say that property is actually an extension of the body, so I may have simply substituted that when I heard you blurring the distinctions. My apologies.\n\n&gt;Because when you violate a person's IP claim there is no damages caused to them or their property. \n\nThis is only if you assume from the beginning that \"property\" is only in physical, rivalrous goods. Change that assumption, and it's possible to obtain the conclusion that IP violations are property crimes.\n\n&gt;Well I always assumed that Maoism tries to pretend that property rights are invalid in the first place, then uses this as a excuse for people in power to seize property for their own purposes and destroy people's lives.\n\nThat's about right. In practice, as you noted, Maoism involves the State being the owner of everything. This leaves no rivalrous resources unclaimed, but that doesn't mean it's a good system. &gt; It's just that I have heard people say that property is actually an extension of the body, so I may have simply substituted that when I heard you blurring the distinctions. My apologies.\n\nIt's difficult to not talk past one another in discussions like this. No apologies needed.  I will probably misunderstand and misinterpret many things you are saying  also.\n\n&gt; This is only if you assume from the beginning that \"property\" is only in physical, rivalrous goods. \n\nI think that 'property rights' can only be justified as limitations to human activity (ie: you can't violate another person's property rights) when it's over rivalrous goods. \n\n I don't think we have a right to just make up 'property rights'... that 'property rights' merely describe the natural phenomena that occurs in human societies. That is people 'owned' things like land, animals, small manufactured goods, and the like without anybody needing to create the concept of 'property rights' first.  That is that that all these 'rights' were created naturally prior to people having any formal understanding of rights in the first place.  I think that property rights were formalized due to the necessity caused by the ever increasingly complex nature of human interactions.  That then means that 'property rights' is more of a scientific discovery then anything else. \n\nI also think that there is a huge amount of confusion caused by 'IP rights' discussions because there is no formal definition of IP rights.  It seems that IP right has actually become a fuzzy concept _on purpose_. That currently we have things like 'copyright law' and 'patent law', but I very rarely see anything resembling these things being discussed. \n ",

    "snippet" : "What do ancaps think of monopolies?\n\nShould anything be done by a government to prevent them?\n\nMore broadly, what would be the end result of a totally unrestricted free market?\n\nIsn't it conceivable that, like the game of Monopoly, there could eventually be one (or *very* few) powerful families that could effectively control just about everything? If so, wouldn't that be pretty bad? It seems that, in peoples' desperation for food, they could be made to agree to anything, no matter how poor the terms of the deal? Wouldn't a tipping point could occur where it's basically 'game over' -- 'back to feudalism' for most or way too many people to seem conscionable?  Monopolies would be rare because they are unstable. If their profit margin is even the slightest bit too high, they attract competition from those offering close or perfect substitutes. The only way a monopoly could exist in the free market is if it offered goods at a price so close to the costs of production that nobody else wanted to compete. They would have to out compete the entire market in order to be all alone as a provider. That just doesn't add up to me. As they get larger and larger the way some companies already do, wouldn't it usually just get easier to get even bigger and use even greater economies of scale and anti-competitive practices to 'win' it all? Think of tipping points.\n\nImagine large companies now that are not allowed to merge with other companies providing the same service? They might like to. They might otherwise agree to. But they are not allowed to. So ask *why* they would like to. The answer, presumably, is that they would like to be bigger and stronger. Rinse. Repeat. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nNow think beyond just monopolies to all sorts of anti-competitive practices that are not allowed. What if they were? I see the economy playing out like a game of monopoly with one winner were it actually gets easier and easier once you get ahead. The hardest part isn't the end, it's being well positioned early on. Add into that the fact that many people in the game of life (well not *the* Game of Life) are entering at different times into potentially 'owned' families where they don't even have the equal opportunities that several people beginning Monopoly have.\n\nFor the record I was an econ major and don't actually think in terms limited to board games. My use of them is merely an analogy, but not one I want disregarded simply because it may seem trivial. I think to an extent it can be instructive of the outcomes of 'winner allowed to take all' scenarios.\n\n &gt; As they get larger and larger the way some companies already do, wouldn't it usually just get easier to get even bigger and use even greater economies of scale and anti-competitive practices to 'win' it all?\n\nNo. Standard Oil brought the price of oil down 90% during the course of its existence, and was only broken apart at the behest of it's competition lobbying the state to break it apart. If oil were *expensive*, then the competition would have flourished because they could *easily* return on their investments.\n\n&gt; So ask why they would like to. The answer, presumably, is that they would like to be bigger and stronger. Rinse. Repeat. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nExcept eventually you run out of money to buy companies up with, or you become so big that you don't run efficiently anymore. The United States Federal Government is a behemoth, and it shows. Social Security is falling apart, we're running a ginormous deficit *every year*, and nobody in the show can actually do anything to fix it.\n\n&gt; I see the economy playing out like a game of monopoly with one winner were it actually gets easier and easier once you get ahead.\n\nMost games of Monopoly end not when everyone goes bankrupt but when people get tired of trying to bankrupt each other. Walking across hotels roll after roll is frightening. Most people I know usually trade \"free landings\" and favors so that everyone can keep playing and building their own distinct and separate corporate firms.\n\nOutside of Monopoly, anti-competitive behavior is a terrible thing for public relations. Just think of when Apple was accused of using slave labor in the Foxconn factories (which was a hoax). Apple's stock tanked, the truth came out that it was a hoax, and now everything's fine again.\n\n&gt; For the record I was an econ major and don't actually think in terms limited to board games.\n\nMonopoly was created by Henry George, a Georgist, which is a term for Libertarian-Socialist, a philosophy that sees capitalism and landed-property as evil. He had a specific goal in mind when he made the game, and it certainly wasn't to say that the free market was good.\n\nPoint being, board games are not a very good way to visualize the world. We don't point to Risk to show how wars will happen, and nor do we go to Jenga to illustrate structural integrity of buildings. Monopoly is not an exemplar of capitalism because it was designed to be its enemy.\n\nThat being said, Game Theory is a highly interesting concept to me because it actually validates a lot of what us ancaps talk about. People on the whole prefer income over time rather than in short bursts, and so will behave with consistency, in what we call The Discipline of Repeat Dealings. This means that backstabbing is very rare, and negative business practices are usually punished and never recovered from. You should say why you're using Standard Oil as an example (besides the sherman antitrust act): Rockefeller made 318 billion dollars, he was the richest person ever by far, so him not fulfilling all these leftist prophecies cuts through a lot of bullshit I... did...?\n\n&gt; No. Standard Oil brought the price of oil down 90% during the course of its existence, and was only broken apart at the behest of it's competition lobbying the state to break it apart. If oil were expensive, then the competition would have flourished because they could easily return on their investments. Well yeah but it doesn't put into scale just *how much* richer rockefeller was than everyone else in the history of business So what if he did it offering people a product that they wanted and entered freely into contracts with him to buy?\n\nAre you insinuating there is a problem with being rich or richer than everyone else?  If not, what is the point of your comment? We've never seen anyone come close to rockefeller, but we have seen evil worse than what the left predicts the rich will do in ancapistan. This proves getting rich and being evil do not go together &gt; As they get larger and larger the way some companies already do, wouldn't it usually just get easier to get even bigger and use even greater economies of scale and anti-competitive practices to 'win' it all?\n\nNo. Standard Oil brought the price of oil down 90% during the course of its existence, and was only broken apart at the behest of it's competition lobbying the state to break it apart.

He was fine with property ownership as long as the property owner compensated others in exchange for the right to its exclusive use. The idea being that those able to pay the most to own the land will be the person who can make the most productive use of it. \n\nYou should check out his book, Progress and Poverty. I read it before i discovered ancap philosophy. Very interesting. &gt; He was fine with property ownership as long as the property owner compensated others in exchange for the right to its exclusive use.\n\nHow's that capitalism?\n It is a form of taxation. Taxes exist today alongside capitalism. It's not capitalism if you are forced to pay taxes. It may not be pure capitalism, but it isn't communism either. Read the book. I don't think anyone was calling it communism. I don't think Henry George was anti-capitalist. He was fine with property ownership as long as the property owner compensated others in exchange for the right to its exclusive use. The idea being that those able to pay the most to own the land will be the person who can make the most productive use of it. \n\nYou should check out his book, Progress and Poverty. I read it before i discovered ancap philosophy. Very interesting. &gt; The idea being that those able to pay the most to own the land will be the person who can make the most productive use of it.\n\nIf I had to pay to use land, I wouldn't ever want to use it productively. There's a specific reason people see themselves wanting to buy a home rather than renting it. Even aside from that, any landlord will tell you about how common tenants destroying property is. Even students in dormitories initiate Tragedies of The Commons in non-owned spaces. In my apartment when I was in college, I was the only person who ever cleaned the place, and I was the one who used the place the least. After every party it was me picking up the pieces, because it wasn't anyone's place in particular and I was the only one who actually cared. And because I was the only person who ever cleaned, I never wanted to invite anyone over or cook or anything since it'd just make even more work on the margin for myself.\n\nPoint being, land-property is imperative to an economy because it avoids the economic problem of The Tragedy of The Commons. &gt;If I had to pay to use land, I wouldn't ever want to use it productively.\n\nYou would have to pay the market rate regardless of how you used it, so if you use it unproductively, you would be losing money.\n\nAnyway, my only point was he was not anti-capitalist, he just had a different view on land ownership. That doesn't actually get at my argument. I insinuated that there would be no reason to do what you say would have to happen. So you would pay money to not make use of something? That depends on the item in question, but that's not the problem with Georgism. The problem is that it implies that people are willing to both pay continually and maintain continually, which are statistically proven to be inversely related. No person wants to maintain something they rent, and no person wants to continually pay to make use of a thing by oneself.  &gt;What do ancaps think of monopolies?\n\nThey're bad.\n\n&gt;Should anything be done by a government to prevent them?\n\nNo, because the government IS the monopoly.\n\n&gt;Isn't it conceivable that, like the game of Monopoly, there could eventually be one (or very few) powerful families that could effectively control just about everything?\n\nThis is only an issue when there is a government involved to create the centralization in the first place.

But wouldn't other monopolies that are currently prevented form.\n\nWithout any oversight at all and without even the appearance of duty to anyone but themselves, wouldn't unrestricted forces eventually take over  in an even worse way?\n\nI can think of some amazingly clever but equally perverse things that profit driven entities could do without any limits to grow bigger and bigger and eventually make practical slaves of everyone else.

Like people who point to Bioshock as an example of a libertarian society not working. Hello, it was written start to finish by someone! They could have made it end in a happy utopia if they wanted to!\n\nAnyway, this is discussed all the time, no point in reiterating everything for the millionth time.

    "snippet" : "I think there is probably a certain amount of correlation between voluntarism and atheism.\n\nWhat are your stances on other topics? I bet many of you are nihilists or existentialists for example.  Considering how the USSR was atheist, I think that's just pure conjecture on your part. What I think really matters is respect for natural rights, and in all honesty I think you'll find people more readily accepting of that in religious communities. There seems to be a logical basis in Ancap theory that doesn't lend itself well to believing in religion. Atheism and Ancapism are the \"null hypotheses\" of their respective philosophies, and I see the evidence for some sort of divine being even less likely than the evidence for a state. It's the same argument of \"Judge the theory by its results, not its intentions.\" I can certainly understand that line of thinking, but I don't think you can call Anarcho-capitalism a null hypotheses, or rather viewing something as \"null\" is entirely relative to what you're comparing it to. Communism is a null hypotheses of property rights, for example.\n\nYou can make the claim that both ideas \"question authority\", but this is also relative as we assert the authority of things like the NAP. Yeah, anarcho-capitalism is definitely the most compatible political philosophy with Protestant Christianity (the one I am most familiar with), but as an Atheist, of course I'm going to be biased and think Atheism is the more logical position. While I'd tend to agree it fits more in line with Protestant Christianity, I actually read an [interesting article by Rothbard](http://mises.org/daily/2607/Lysander-Spooner-Libertarian-Pietist) claiming that this has historically not been the case. The protestant emphasis is on getting to no God on a personal basis while catholics tend to be a bit more ritualistic, leading one to think protestants would be the ones to be more freedom loving while Catholics advocate hierarchy, but he says it worked out the opposite way. Protestants began to see the State as a tool for creating the \"best environment for conversion possible\" while Catholics simply wanted to be left alone to follow the counsel of their priests.\n\nI thought it was pretty interesting. Yeah, it is interesting how that is the case. I was speaking from the angle of what the Bible says, and looking to the early church as a model of the modern Christian. Of course, as we all know, somehow modern Protestants have ridiculously interpreted the Bible to alleviate their consciences of guilt while wishing to establish a theocracy. If I ever hear Christians advocating for that, I redirect them right to 1 Samuel 8, which was apparently when Israel originally started crying out for a king. Great anti-state stuff there.\n\n10 Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. 11 He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. 12 Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. 14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. 15 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. 16 Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use. 17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and **you yourselves will become his slaves.** 18 When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.” yea. I love this one as well. from matt 15 (NIV) \n13 “But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius? 14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15 **Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money?** Or are you envious because I am generous?’\n Considering how the USSR was atheist, I think that's just pure conjecture on your part. What I think really matters is respect for natural rights, and in all honesty I think you'll find people more readily accepting of that in religious communities. Maybe you are right. It seemed to me that religious people may be less likely to accept the legalisation of drugs, prostitution, abortion etc that our philosophy entails. That's true, but I think it's always good to emphasize that \"allow\" doesn't necessarily mean \"endorse\". I think that most Christians you would find that believe homosexuality is immoral still wouldn't want some kind of state crusade to imprison or tax them or whatever. &gt;I think that most Christians you would find that believe homosexuality is immoral still wouldn't want some kind of state crusade to imprison or tax them or whatever.\n\nAs a Christian who routinely makes the argument that the Bible is pretty clear that we absolutely should not support this kind of crusade, sadly there are plenty of Christians who don't feel that way. There is, however, I growing movement of Christian libertarianism that I see in my peers (college age and young professional) who at least are starting to distrust government as a valid solution for most problems. I'm doing what I can to keep planting the see and generally moving people towards the anarchism end of the pool. We won't really know how well it works for another 25 years, I'd say, but we can hope (and pray, for some of us.\n\nThere are also a notable minority of vocal Christian AnCaps like Bob Murphy, Walter Block, and Tom Woods, (and possibly Ron Paul?)so there's obviously a precedent. Still got my work cut out for me.\n\nIncidentally, I'm working through trying to get some of my subversive anarchist/contrarian ideas combined with my religious views into an eBook, which hopefully I'll have to start passing around to people in the next month or two. Anyone interested in seeing a draft should PM me and I'll try to get a copy out once things are more or less in place... I'm entirely with you, man.\n\nListen to Tom Woods and Bob Murphey all the time. I don't think Block is a Christian though, just to point that out. I would definitely put Ron Paul as one of us. I haven't heard him directly talk about anarcho-capitalism, but he has dropped the name voluntaryism quite a few times. He also talked about how he thought Lysander Spooner had some interesting ideas too, while saying that his goal right now was to just get the US back to the Constitution. I'm pretty sure he's an ancap who's just making as wide an appeal as possible. I could have sworn I saw Block identify as Catholic somewhere, but I don't see it anywhere now. I know he's at Loyola, but that doesn't mean he's Jesuit, I guess. So you may be right on that, I just have this nagging sense that I'm missing something somewhere... Maybe you are right. It seemed to me that religious people may be less likely to accept the legalisation of drugs, prostitution, abortion etc that our philosophy entails. Considering how the USSR was atheist, I think that's just pure conjecture on your part. What I think really matters is respect for natural rights, and in all honesty I think you'll find people more readily accepting of that in religious communities.

I am an optimist, a Catholic, and I go out drinking with a bunch of statists every weekend.\n\nEdit: Update - I succeeded in getting hammered I'm exactly the same. I only personally know two other libertarian anarchists; one is in another state and the other I'm friendly with but never hang out with.   not relevant to freedom. &gt;not relevant to freedom.\n\nIs that sentence complete? If so I don't fully understand what you are saying. not relevant to freedom.  Pantheist here.  All the RL libertarians/AnCaps I know are Christian. How many is that? I know about 5 in real life, and we're all humanist.       I don't like what nationalism leads too, but I still like watching football and rooting for the team from my city. I hate when Adam Kokesh gets up on his pedestal and berates people for watching team sports. I think it's a very entertaining game and I enjoy watching high caliber athletes compete. And if I'm going to be invested in watching, why not cheer for the team that's closest to me? Also, /r/nfl is a fun place.  Um, I'm an atheist, I like football, cycling, piano, sunshine, whisky, my little pony: friendship is magic, extended showers, cinnamon toast crunch cereal, the baltimore ravens, putting whisky in the milk remaining after eating cinnamon toast crunch cereal, franz liszt, and pork.\n\nOh and I guess I'm a nihilist humanist if that makes sense. Guess that makes me an existentialist? Whatever.  I'm an atheist, but I'm also a social conservative. Not enough of us in my opinion. I've been called a \"teleological social Darwinist,\" since my ethics revolves around survival of genes and the importance of inherited genetic and cultural traits in facilitating that.  \n\nI'm also a nationalist, specifically a White separatist. There's a small relevance to my political beliefs as I believe Whites are most inclined towards libertarianism, but in general people don't seem inclined towards libertarianism at all. My guiding principle is libertarian theory and pretty much all my beliefs must remain consistent with that.     religious \"voluntaryists\" (almost an oxymoron) reject the temporary earthly state for the eternal state. \n\nhttp://www.ancapfreethinker.info/?page_id=58\n\nAlso, Chris Hitchens has some good material on how religion is like an eternal North Korea. Not all religions are the same, and not all religions involve justification of behavior. As long as a belief set remains a subjective view of the world rather than a justification for an objective affecting of the world, why should anyone care? Because beliefs affect action.",

    "snippet" : "So I've browsed this subreddit a few times and it interest me and I would like to learn more about the topic. Can anyone recommend any books that would enlighten me a bit more about Anarcho-Capitalism. I appreciate the input.  Here, these should help.\n\n* [The Production of Security](http://library.mises.org/books/Gustave%20de%20Molinari/The%20Production%20of%20Security.pdf) by Gustave de Molinari - This is the first ever recorded advocate of anarcho-capitalism, although not under that name, and it is a beautiful and quick book on why security can best be left to the free market.\n\n* [Anatomy of the State](http://library.mises.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/Anatomy%20of%20the%20State.pdf) by Murray Rothbard - In this essay, Rothbard breaks down just what the state is and gives the reader a much more clear understanding into its true nature. I absolutely love this, it is a must read.\n\n* [The Law](http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html) by Frederic Bastiat - While this is actually a defense of minarchism, this essay will give you a good understanding of natural rights. There are few people in history who had as much of a passion for liberty as Frederic Bastiat, and really that's the most important thing.\n\n* [For a New Liberty](http://mises.org/rothbard/foranewlb.pdf) by Murray Rothbard - Rothbard gives a manifesto on libertarianism, and an overview in general.\n\n* [The Ethics of Liberty](http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf) by Murray Rothbard- Rothbard's ultimate work on natural rights.\n\n* [No Treason](http://www.freedomforallseasons.org/TaxFreedomEmail/LysanderSpoonerNoTreason.pdf) by Lysander Spooner - Perhaps the greatest argument as to why the Constitution holds no authority and why the US government is invalid ever written.\n\n* [Power and Market](http://library.mises.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/Power%20and%20Market%20Government%20and%20the%20Economy.pdf) by Murray Rothbard - In this book, Rothbard goes into the problems with every single kind of state intervention, which him specifically focusing on anarcho-capitalism in the first chapter.\n\n---\n\nI made a suggested reading list for /r/austrian_economics ([here's a link to the post itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/1798eh/help_understanding_austrian_economics/c83kson)), so that might be interesting to you as well. These people won't all be anarcho-capitalists, but they are all pro-free market and will help you understand many key problems with the state. For you, I particularly recommend [Economics in One Lesson](http://library.mises.org/books/Henry%20Hazlitt/Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson.pdf) and [Capitalism in One Lesson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eP6iujgeWI). But maybe something else will catch your interest too.\n\n* [Principles of Economics](http://library.mises.org/books/Carl%20Menger/Principles%20of%20Economics.pdf) by Carl Menger - The book that started it all. It's also pretty short. Some of these ideas have been modified over time though. For example, Menger says the prerequisites of action are a human need, a thing that can solve the need, knowledge that the thing can solve it, and command of the thing that solves it. Most people today would combine the second and third prerequisite and simply say \"the belief that a means can satisfy the end\" as to explain things like fortune-tellers, raindances, and other such things. Menger had made an unnecessary distinction with them, classifying them as \"imaginary goods\". This book is the best way to get you thinking like an Austrian Economist.\n\n* [Economics in One Lesson](http://library.mises.org/books/Henry%20Hazlitt/Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson.pdf) by Henry Hazlitt - The modern version of Bastiats classic essay [That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html), which gave us the term \"broken window fallacy\". This develops on the practical implications of many Austrian ideas, and is stated very clearly as it was meant for people without any formal training in economics.\n\n* [Praxgirl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNU_-__LlQ&amp;list=SPEE9A33593A261433&amp;index=1) - This video series explains the basics of praxeology. Girl's pretty cute too.\n\n* [What has Government Done to Our Money?](http://mises.org/books/whathasgovernmentdone.pdf) by Murray Rothbard - This will help give you an Austrian understanding of money in its development, nature, and use.\n\n* [Capitalism in One Lesson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eP6iujgeWI) - A video that essentially explains our idea of capitalism, mostly from an anarcho-capitalist/voluntaryist perspective. Not only a good summary on just about everything we think about the economy, but also links to plenty of very useful articles that expand on lots of ideas.\n\n* [A manifesto on the epistemology of economics](http://adrianbrenes.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-manifesto-on-epistemology-of-economics.html) - Short blogpost summing up how Austrians think economics is understood.\n\n* [The Failure of the \"New Economics\"](http://mises.org/books/failureofneweconomics.pdf) by Henry Hazlitt - This isn't all that short, but it'll probably be handy to you if you want to look at Austrian takes on particular issues in Keynesianism. Good to have as reference material if nothing else.\n\n* [Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth](http://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf) by Ludwig von Mises - Perhaps the most damaging criticism of Marxist socialism (that is, an economy entirely run by the state) in existence, Mises argues that even if a socialist country was populated and run by angels, it would still not be able to effectively run an economy because it would have no profit and loss system and could therefore not know whether resources are being used for their most valued ends. Gives you a good sense of how much Austrians put an emphasis on prices and why we believe markets handle things better than governments.\n\n* [Mises wiki article on Austrian Business Cycle Theory](http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_Business_Cycle_Theory) - This is a very important and unique aspect of Austrian theory which cannot be ignored. The essential idea is that inflation (that is an expansion of the money supply, *not* a general rise in prices) artificially lowers interest rates which drives people away from savings and towards short-term consumption while simultaneously attracting businesses to invest in long-term production. While this happens there is an artificial boom as business expands and people consume more, but as time goes on the long-run hits only to find that there was no savings to justify the production, meaning the only possible cure is liquidation of the bad production so those resources can be reallocated to where they really need to be. In addition, it is explained shortly in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq8wk_bnvaU), while a more academic explanation is given in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhoFOyy7rbo).\n\n* [\"Fear the Boom and Bust\" a Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Anthem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk) - I mean, its a rap battle between Hayek and Keynes, what's not to love? Pretty good production value and explains the essential idea of the Austrian Business Cycle surprisingly well. It also had a sequel with [Fight of the Century: Keynes vs. Hayek Round Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc), which is even better IMO.\n\n* Two great articles on praxeology. [Praxeology (The Laws Of Human Action)](http://intentionalworldview.com/Praxeology+%28The+Laws+Of+Human+Action%29) is a great explenation on what praxeology essentially is and [Catallactics (Austrian Economics)](http://intentionalworldview.com/Catallactics+%28Austrian+Economics%29) explains how some essential ideas and laws of economics are understood praxeologically. Ohh wow, thanks for all the info, I really appreciate the help. I will def have plenty of reading to educate myself now!       I'm glad people are interested in this subject, but I wish we didn't have to answer this same question every day. Do we need more info on the sidebar?",

    "title" : "Uninsured motorists in Ancapistan",
    "snippet" : "So I just renewed my auto insurance policy tonight, and it got me thinking: currently in order to own a car, I am forced by the govt to pay for auto insurance. Even if I was not forced, I think I would still pay for it, since the monthly premium is vastly smaller than the costs associated with auto accidents. Currently, if you are caught driving uninsured, you get arrested/fined and automatically at fault for any accidents you are in. What happens to uninsured motorists in an Ancap society?\n\nFor example: I am driving (insured) and get in an accident with an uninsured motorist, and they are at fault. My insurance will cover the costs of any damage to their property or medical bills, but if they choose to not have insurance, how do my bills get paid? \n\nMy first reaction would be to sue them for damages, but lets just say that they don't have any money, or not nearly enough to cover my bills (hence they can't afford insurance). Also, now that I am at a higher risk to my insurance company, my rates would probably go up. \n\nI guess a more general question would be: What happens when people are wronged by people with no way to compensate damages? \n\nAnother solution would be to garnish their wages (if thats even possible in Ancapistan), but what if they make so little money that they decide to just not work anymore? I mean, say I am paralyzed (or killed) in the accident and they have no way of paying for their damages done to me.\n\nYet another solution would be that the companies that own the roads could force me to have auto insurance in order to drive on their roads. How can they enforce that? I dont think of some meter maid pulling me over to ask for \"my papers,\" without cause when I think about living in a free society.\n\n\n[Footnote: I realize that healthcare in Ancapistan would be quite inexpensive compared to corporate or state run healthcare costs.]  I don't see insurance working too differently than how it does now. To use private roads they will require proof of insurance, which will all be verified automatically through the internet as soon as you enter a road. If I was an owner of a road I would certainly want to give the best service to my customers. Lowering the chance of non-payment in case of an accident might be one such service. Road owners might or might not have their own security. They might simply document the incident and blacklist the driver, submitting all the information to Data Collection Agencies. Such a lawbreaker would soon find it difficult to do business with others and he might be detained by police and taken to court for trespassing. Keep in mind that they must agree to be detained or to be taken to court, since the police are not permitted under the NAP to initiate force (forced detainment would not be responsive force because the trespassing is not occurring as they detain him, and anyway detention is not a proportional response to trespassing, eviction is), but I'm sure they would do so for fear of being ousted even further from society and unable to do business with even more people.\n\nOther than this small detail, I think that your explanation is great; insurance is a good thing to have, and its even better to know that everyone else driving has insurance. However, the only way to make it so that everyone driving on a road has insurance is through force, so we have to find a way for justifiable force (force used to remove trespassers from one's property, in this case) to be used to do this. Property rules established by road owners would surely be the way to go about ensuring that roads are safe. &gt;Keep in mind that they must agree to be detained or to be taken to court\n\nIf they drive on a road, in which the private owner has them sign a contract, or at least notifies them of the policies of the road, they very much can be detained or taken to court. If they still refuse any restitution, then ostracization could take effect as a means for enforcement. Specifically, they would likely loose the ability to drive on roads, or have to drive on more dangerous routes. &gt;Keep in mind that they must agree to be detained or to be taken to court\n\nIf they drive on a road, in which the private owner has them sign a contract, or at least notifies them of the policies of the road, they very much can be detained or taken to court. If they still refuse any restitution, then ostracization could take effect as a means for enforcement. Specifically, they would likely loose the ability to drive on roads, or have to drive on more dangerous routes.  In New Hampshire car insurance is not compulsory, their society has yet to collapse.  Thousands of people get killed by auto accidents every year. I honestly hate driving: the long commute due to government intervention in the creation of highways and roads, the traffic due to Google Cars being illegal (currently), the suburbs due to draconian zoning policies, etc.\n\nWithout government, I dont think there would be any cars. I think if people were scared about situations like this (from driving, operating heavy equipment, etc), there could be a type of life insurance that you pay into, but pays you if something bad happens. And more people would likely walk, ride a bike, or take a bus/train.        Forced labor camp is always an option.  I dont think being sent to a labor camp is appropriate for getting into a car accident, even if the other driver is maimed or killed. Also, I dont think you can force anyone to go against their will in ancapistan. If you agree to having it done to you beforehand, anything is permissible in ancapistan. Say it's put into your DRO contract that you agree in advance to go to prison if a judge certified by that DRO pronounces you guilty. Say that, at that prison, you have the opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably by working towards some kind of compensation or restoration of the previous state of affairs. That way, DROs compete, in part, in the severity of their prisons - if you think it's right that criminals be punished more harshly if they don't help compensate for an accident, you buy from a DRO with that kind of contractual provision. If you're worried you might end up in prison for some reason, you buy from a DRO that has relatively decent prison living standards, but you'll have to pay more (because it's more expensive to have decent living standards than spartan ones) and it's more likely that you'll want to buy auto insurance in that case anyway. What happens if you break the contract by refusing to present yourself to jail. What would the penalty be? In ancap, I think the only penalty is to escrow money or assets and surrender those assets when you violate contracts. The size of the contracts that people are willing to sign with you will depends of the size of the assets you have escrowed. Anything else violates the NAP. It is a common misunderstanding to assume that there is no force in Ancapistan. It is no violation of the NAP to use force to execute a just contract. An interesting comparison is to view the assortment of DRO's as potential executive branches of each individual citizen, whom have chosen to delegate their duty of self-defense. If you own yourself, then enforcing contractual obligations and the defense of your property are forms of self-defense. After the damage is done, you can \"retaliate\" against the man's property by confiscating it but not against him personally, or you violate the NAP. Yes, but that is force just the same.

    "title" : "Christopher Cantwell debating minarchy. Question: is this harsh, black and white stance against minarchy required? Attempting to stop wars and drug wars are legitimate activities. What's the balance between de-legitimization of the state vs. appropriation of it?",
    "snippet" : "  Instead of putting effort into changing the state's institutions to be more liberty-oriented, effort should be put into establishing alternative institutions that give people an anti-state option to fulfill their needs. I think the latter strategy is just as powerful at improving liberty in the short term, but holds the additional advantage of improving the outlook of the eventual stateless society. This is actually something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about lately. As a Christian, I'm really starting to get disgusted with the continuing emphasis the church places on legislative approaches to solving problems, even when I agree that the problem is a real issue. For instance, I'm opposed to abortion, but I realize that the standard \"pro-life\" position is a call to use retributive justice to scare people into changing their behavior (or at least not getting caught). Even if you buy the idea that pursuing this sort of punishment will reduce the number of abortions, shouldn't the fact that you're explicitly using violence as a means be giving us pause?\n\nI'm far more interested in finding ways that we can undermine the \"need\" for a state than trying to bend it to my particular will. Think of all the lobbying and campaign money that's going more or less into someone politican's pocket that could be spent on helping to provide resources for some girl who doesn't want to have an abortion but sees no other choice. The end is the same (reducing the number of abortions) but it's a means I can not only live with, but feel good about as it actually resonates well with my faith.\n\nNow if only I could get other Christians to listen to me and not think I'm crazy because that's not what Rush Limbaugh told them... That's *exactly* what I want to see. Creating a support organization that provides resources (adoption, counseling, financial support for food/medical care) to pregnant women would be far more beneficial than simply declaring that abortion should not be done. It's the difference between performing an action, and writing down on a piece of paper that the action should be done. Writing things on paper doesn't accomplish anything; taking action does.\n\nIn this case, the best course of action also results in a net *reduction* in violence, rather than a net increase, so it's double plus good! Instead of putting effort into changing the state's institutions to be more liberty-oriented, effort should be put into establishing alternative institutions that give people an anti-state option to fulfill their needs. I think the latter strategy is just as powerful at improving liberty in the short term, but holds the additional advantage of improving the outlook of the eventual stateless society. Agreed. But let's take a hypothetical. Let's say there is a referendum on the war or the war on drugs, and we even know that the vote is polling very close or even in favor of ending a war. I think Cantwell would argue that participating in the referendum or voting validates the state and therefore should be rejected by all in favor of no state.  ",

    "snippet" : "  What the fuck? This was the most economic fallacy-filled steaming pile of shit I've ever read. This dude has know idea how economies grow. This is the problem with reddit, you always get some jackass who doesn't know shit with alright writing-ability who just posts horseshit and everyone jerks off to it. The fact that 96% of people got out of farming was sure really \"horrible\" for the economy, automation creates jobs in other sectors. What did he say that was wrong? Serious question even if you disagree that automation is lowering the demand for labor, he is just saying how the economy will probably change because today a lot of it is based around automobiles. Well the most blaring economic fallacy is the destruction of the work force by increasing technology. It's simply just not true. In the short run you see labor lost in a sector due automation and technological advance. But that advance generally lowers prices, which can increase the demand, thereby increasing those you need to oversee the machines. Also, this lower prices frees money from the public at large to be spent in other sectors, such that the excess labor is captured in the long run.\n\nTL;DR Technological advance ultimately leads to economic growth, including the growth of employment opportunities. &gt;But that advance generally lowers prices\n\nNot generally, it DOES, or else there would be no advance.\n\nThis is what the OP misses, yes we won't be paying the salaries of millions of automaker workers, but we also WON'T BE PAYING THE SALARIES OF MILLIONS OF AUTOMAKER WORKERS.\n\nIt's just simple math, if we have cheaper products, we don't have to work as much to buy those same products. Well the most blaring economic fallacy is the destruction of the work force by increasing technology. It's simply just not true. In the short run you see labor lost in a sector due automation and technological advance. But that advance generally lowers prices, which can increase the demand, thereby increasing those you need to oversee the machines. Also, this lower prices frees money from the public at large to be spent in other sectors, such that the excess labor is captured in the long run.\n\nTL;DR Technological advance ultimately leads to economic growth, including the growth of employment opportunities. This has possibly been true in the past but not necessarily in the future. For example, imagine a hypothetical world where there was nothing a human could do that couldn't be done extremely cheaply by machines.\n\n&gt;But that advance generally lowers prices, which can increase the demand, thereby increasing those you need to oversee the machines.\n\nDemand would have to increase a lot in order for this to happen. And the fewer people you need per unit produced, the more demand has to increase to keep up in order to keep the same number of people employed. Demand would need to approach infinity as labor approaches zero.\n\n&gt;Also, this lower prices frees money from the public at large to be spent in other sectors, such that the excess labor is captured in the long run.\n\nPossibly but a smaller and smaller fraction of the money they are spending goes to labor.\n\nIt's just supply and demand. Imagine if we were talking about another good. Say oil. Most oil is used for transportation. So imagine if electric cars replaced the need for gasoline in the same way automation replaces the need for human workers. The price would go down. If the price gets low enough people might find other uses for it, just like businesses might find uses for human workers when wages get low enough.\n\nThe oil producers would make a lot less profit just like laborers make less wages. They might get an advantage from cheaper transportation costs, but it wouldn't make up for the profit they were making from oil at all. Workers would benefit from cheaper goods but it wouldn't make up for their lower wages. &gt;For example, imagine a hypothetical world where there was nothing a human could do that couldn't be done extremely cheaply by machines.\n\nThis is called post-scarcity, if there is nothing that humans NEED to do, then why do they need work?\n\nIt is also impossible, post-scarcity cannot happen, who makes the machines?  Machines you say?  Who makes and repairs the machines who make the machines?  More machines you say?  This is a terminator fantasy. They don't need to work. But they won't get an income either.\n\nHow is it impossible for machines to make other machines? That's basically what we have now. Eventually it will get to the work that it will require very little if any human assistance. I don't think you're thinking the economics through.  Why do people \"need\" to work?  If people don't \"need\" to work, why would they need an income?\n\n&gt;How is it impossible for machines to make other machines? That's basically what we have now.

Although, I doubt people will ever want machines to make EVERYTHING.

This would be a utopia, people laying around with robots fanning them and feeding them grapes.  People would have endless time to create new things and ideas, this is humanity's goal.  Although, I doubt people will ever want machines to make EVERYTHING.  Kind of how there will always be a local farming niche, I will always be willing to pay slightly more to have human hands somewhere in the process of my products, if not everywhere. They don't need to work. But they won't get an income either.\n\nHow is it impossible for machines to make other machines? That's basically what we have now. Eventually it will get to the work that it will require very little if any human assistance. Why do you need an income? If goods are infinite, then prices are zero.  Who said goods are infinite? Just because they can be produced without human labor doesn't mean they become free. People still own the resources and machines which create them. This has possibly been true in the past but not necessarily in the future. For example, imagine a hypothetical world where there was nothing a human could do that couldn't be done extremely cheaply by machines.\n\n&gt;But that advance generally lowers prices, which can increase the demand, thereby increasing those you need to oversee the machines.\n\nDemand would have to increase a lot in order for this to happen. And the fewer people you need per unit produced, the more demand has to increase to keep up in order to keep the same number of people employed. Demand would need to approach infinity as labor approaches zero.\n\n&gt;Also, this lower prices frees money from the public at large to be spent in other sectors, such that the excess labor is captured in the long run.\n\nPossibly but a smaller and smaller fraction of the money they are spending goes to labor.\n\nIt's just supply and demand. Imagine if we were talking about another good. Say oil. Most oil is used for transportation. So imagine if electric cars replaced the need for gasoline in the same way automation replaces the need for human workers. The price would go down. If the price gets low enough people might find other uses for it, just like businesses might find uses for human workers when wages get low enough.\n\nThe oil producers would make a lot less profit just like laborers make less wages. They might get an advantage from cheaper transportation costs, but it wouldn't make up for the profit they were making from oil at all. Workers would benefit from cheaper goods but it wouldn't make up for their lower wages. Well that was a quick answer, Henry Hazlitt has a whole chapter on this topic in one of his books, when I get home I can give you a better answer. It has essentially always been true. \n\nThe main problem I see with that scenario is that if everything can be done extremely cheaply by machines does it matter that their isn't much need for labor? Which is to say in that hypothetical scenario would not the prices of everything be so low that it wouldn't matter that their was not as great a demand for employment?  Outside of the temporary impact on the job security of seamstresses, living standards improved for everyone thanks to the invention of the sewing machine. It was unfortunate for those who made their living being seamstresses but to say \"life got hard\" you must ignore the base of people who benefited by the invention of the sewing machine. Living standards improved for everyone else, and in at least one way for even the seamstresses of the time too. For even seamstresses clothes were much cheaper, and clothing easier to repair. The problem of seamstress unemployment lasted for at most one generation because people reacted to the decreased demand for seamstresses, and fewer people now sought training to become seamstresses. Even among those unemployed seamstresses, many seamstresses found new work and at least some portion of them found jobs they liked better than the one they had previously.  http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/17ncdd/user_joshamania_theorizes_how_driverless_vehicles/\n\nAn interesting discussion here as well.\n\nIt's a great subreddit. look at what he takes from it, he thinks this advancement of technology is scary and will be a bad thing.  He is afraid of the unemployment and horrible economic impacts... it's a fallacy we see repeated after every single technological advancement, and he is advancing the fallacy. How is it a fallacy? Automation lowers the demand for labor. If it didn't there would be no advantage in it. If you had to hire just as many people to build and maintain the automated machines as you would replace with them, your labor costs wouldn't go down. &gt;Automation lowers the demand for labor.\n\nSo, economically, any time you increase the efficiency of something you increase the demand for it. This isn't a law so much as an observation that appears to have been true in basically all major instances throughout history. Increasing efficiency of various fuels made them more attractive economically and led to the rise of machines that used them. Likewise, automation for work in textile factories led to an increase in the number of workers needed to work in said factories because of the substantial growth in production.\n\nObviously this only holds within certain limits and when applied to labor it becomes complicated because human capital varies from person to person (while a gallon of oil is more or less equivalent to every other gallon). And eventually you reach the point that increases in efficiency outpace increased demand for the product, but the increased efficiency in one sector does not remain isolated to that sector: the increased automation in the production of cars may have decreased the number of people needing to work to make those cars (though probably only in recent decades. For most of the history of the car increased automation increased the demand for labor), but it has increased demand for labor in dozens of supporting industries (gasoline, roads, sound tech, mechanics).\n\nAs always, you seem to have fallen into the trap of looking at just one facet of a massively complicated system and rendered a judgment while ignoring the mountains of other factors that undermine your point. It's a common error, and not one that any of us are immune to (despite how hard we try). As a matter of fact, it's the main reason most of us are against government control of the economy: because there's no way to know how a given change will really play out until it's been made.\n\nTL;DR: Your Post = Broken Windows Fallacy It's not the broken window fallacy. The broken window fallacy claims the amount of wealth will be increased by breaking windows. Of course the net wealth, the amount of things we can produce would be greater with automation. But the benefit goes to the people that own the automated machines. The wages for laborers will go down as more and more workers are competing for less and less necessity for them.\n\nAt best the price drops will make up for the decreased wages and they will be more or less as well off as they were before (even though the amount of total wealth will increase massively.) I don't see any reason that is guaranteed to be the case though. You should probably reread your Bastiat. The broken window fallacy has no more to do with windows than the \"If-by-whisky\" fallacy has to do with alcohol. That is, it gets its name from an example dealing with the thing in question, but the fallacy itself is a generic concept that applies in much wider realm of situations.\n\n&gt;But the benefit goes to the people that own the automated machines.\n\nThat's quite an assertion. There's really absolutely no benefit to the workers? By the rules of the internet I can dismiss it without providing a source since you made it without one. However, I'll simply ask how you explain the fact that standard of living (and thus real wages) increased dramatically following the industrial revolution when capital and thus worker efficiency and automation increased several hundredfold. Yes, some fields saw a decrease in number employed, but this also proved to be a substantial boon for virtually everyone, including the displaced workers who now could afford to eat on a few hours a day's worth of work instead of living at a subsistence level where it literally took all of their labor to get enough food to avoid starvation.\n\n&gt;At best the price drops will make up for the decreased wages\n\nI'll save you the trouble of scrolling back up and will, instead, just copy the previous paragraph again. After all, our goal is to maximize the total labor expended, and efficiency only hurts, right? I guess I should probably type it out again, then...\n\nThat's quite an assertion.

Automation lowers the demand for labor. If it didn't there would be no advantage in it. If you had to hire just as many people to build and maintain the automated machines as you would replace with them, your labor costs wouldn't go down. The fallacy is in aggregating 'demand for labour'. Automation lowers the demand for that specific kind of labour, not necessarily for labour in general.  Well it doesn't increase the demand for labor anywhere else, so the net demand is down. There will be the same number of people there were before competing for all the same jobs, except for the ones that automation replaced. With a larger supply of labor, the price will go down and more jobs might be created, but everyone will have lower wages than before. &gt;Well it doesn't increase the demand for labor anywhere else\n\nYes it does.  Technological advancements save consumers money which they are able to spend on whatever else they prefer to spend it on. So lets say that they save 10% on the cost of something. If it originally cost a dollar, it's now 90 cents. That's 10 cents they save each unit they buy, 10 cents that would have gone to workers. Now if they buy 9 of them, they save 90 cents. They spent $8.10, and none of it went to the workers, who would have gotten that 90 cents before.\n\nSo now it depends entirely what they spend the money on. If they buy something where 100% of the money goes to workers, it will break even. If they use that saved 90 cents to buy another one, none of it goes to the workers at all. And if they buy some other product that hasn't been automated yet and only 10% of the price is for labor, the workers will only get 9 cents of the 90 they originally were making.\n\nAnyways you can change the numbers to whatever you want if you don't think that's realistic, but the effect is the same. \"The workers\" is not a stagnant group, it is constantly adapting to the technologies available to us. They adapt because they lose their jobs and have no choice. How is it a fallacy? Automation lowers the demand for labor. If it didn't there would be no advantage in it. If you had to hire just as many people to build and maintain the automated machines as you would replace with them, your labor costs wouldn't go down. Right, we should go back to horse and carriage.  Think of all the horse and carriage makers that lost their jobs! They did lose their jobs. Are the carriage makers better off? Absolutely.  Are you serious? If the carriage makers were better off working elsewhere they wouldn't have become carriage makers. Perhaps they benefited some from faster transportation, but does that alone make up for their reduced income?\n\nOf course the net wealth is increased by having cars, no one disputes that. But even if the collective benefit is great individual groups can still be worse off. And in this case we aren't talking about a specific industry but nearly all of them. &gt;If the carriage makers were better off working elsewhere they wouldn't have become carriage makers. Perhaps they benefited some from faster transportation, but does that alone make up for their reduced income?\n\nI don't think you understand the macro-scale of economics.  If EVERYONE is paying less for one product, this results in an entire economy that is more profitable.  More profit results in more income and lower costs.  The benefit to the carriage worker is not merely just improved transportation, it's an entire economy that is more efficient and cheaper.  Plus on top of that, he gets a better paying job making automobiles.\n\nThese improvements cannot even begin to be perceived by the luddite's close-minded micro view of the economy.   Man automated cars would be so great, we could go on vacation, and just sit back in the RV, and take naps, and enjoy the scenery.  I could finish from the long trip, refreshed, instead of exhausted.   Our food would and goods would be way way cheaper.   If cars are pooled, like he says, I wouldn't have to worry about crap like insurance, licenses, and papers.    Now, I have to drive a few hour road trip, just to get visitation with my son.  Those days would be over.   The nightmare of big stadium events, and the massive long wait and lines of cars, and an exhausting hunt for parking would be over ... my car could just drop me off, and pick me up later.   My wife could use the car while I'm at work, and it would be waiting for me at the door when I get off.   When in the city, my car could drop me off at the apartment, and park miles away.   The hunt for parking is over.   If I need to run an errand to pick something up, I just send my car instead of myself.  It would save me so much time, so many headaches, I can't understand what he's complaining about.   \n\nOh, and when I get old.  I can still drive wherever I want without being home-bound, or at the mercy of friends or neighbors.     Another question to ask is what will driverless cars look like? They will not need to have any of the safety features they do now. There's very little reason for them to sit more than two people. Do they even need four wheels? Two wheels? With well maintained roads can it be a one wheel electric vehicle with a cabin for a passenger or two?",

    "snippet" : "  Since government takes people's money by force, it's not as worried about the bad PR.  I'm not going to read the article, but the act of handcuffing a child will probably instill a 'criminal mindset' in him for a long portion of his life with negative repercussions.   Very likely but not absolutely.  I had a few run-ins with authority/police at a very young age (I was not a criminal, I wasn't even a bad kid) that I now realize basically sent me down the road of anti-authority, anti-statism, anarchy.\n\nIn fact, at age 12 I was interrogated alone by a power-happy pig to the point of crying almost exactly like the claim in this story, for something I didn't even do.\n\n**TL:DR** This might be good for the kid in the long run. I'm not going to read the article, but the act of handcuffing a child will probably instill a 'criminal mindset' in him for a long portion of his life with negative repercussions.   From what Ive read, the handcuff child was already acting in a criminal mindset.\n\nHes a bully. A really, really bad bully.  That handcuffed kid is a terror, a thief, and a little shit.\n\nOf course, the handcuffing is wrong. But this story is deeper then people realize.  250 million dollars? Of whose money? Certainly not the cops. They want 250 million of OUR MONEY! God damn, lawsuits are getting fucking ridiculous. Quarter billion dollars for a little bit of hand cuffing? I'd be willing to give the kid 50 grand. That's a good college education or bail when he comes of age.  The government is of the people.  The people pay for it since they are responsible for voting for those responsible for hiring these thugs and tolerating this behavior.   Hah fucking pigs! I hope that family gets every last cent of that 250 million and I hope some prick cops lose their jobs over this. ...aaaaand where do you think that $250M is coming from?\n\nFresh taxes ahoy! ...aaaaand where do you think that $250M is coming from?\n\nFresh taxes ahoy! Yeah probably. But so what? You'd rather the cops get away with hand cuffing a kid and fucking with him? You want that to be your kid? And if it were your kid wouldn't the very least you would settle for is enough money to make sure you and your family would never have to work another day in your lives? No, punish the cops and their bosses, not the taxpayers.  Fire them.  Maybe break out the tar and feathers.  Then let them make their way in the private sector like the rest of us.\n\nYou think that cop gives a shit how much the city has to pay for a lawsuit?  Let him find a new career, and he won't make that mistake again. The taxpayers are complicit, they deserve to lose that money. Maybe it will give them an incentive to change their perception of the police and government.\n\nWhat your analogy is saying is that Hitler was never guilty of anything, it was the prison guards that did everything. The US is supposedly controlled by the taxpayers, therefore it's the taxpayers that are responsible.\n\nHow about this. you invite me to a dinner party at your house. I know and trust you, you're a responsible person. At this dinner party is a loud mouth buffoon, who picks a fight with me and puts me in the hospital. Who is responsible for paying my hospital bills, you as the property owner, that invited all the guests or the guy that did the punching or both? Remember that I had no control who you invited to the party, I was placing my trust in you that the party would be safe. The taxpayers \"deserve\" to lose that money?  Taxation theft, which is then misapplied, justifies *more* taxation theft?\n\nYour dinner party analogy is deply flawed.  Leaving aside the fact that I cannot be held responsible for another person's actions, *you have the option of not showing up to my dinner party.*  If I regularly invite buffoons, then you don't have to come.  The state does not generally allow you that option. No, punish the cops and their bosses, not the taxpayers.  Fire them.  Maybe break out the tar and feathers.  Then let them make their way in the private sector like the rest of us.\n\nYou think that cop gives a shit how much the city has to pay for a lawsuit?  Let him find a new career, and he won't make that mistake again. Ohhhhh... tar and feathers.... Not a bad idea. I'd prefer a good caning or perhaps a couple of weeks in the stocks.\n\nI agree with punishing the cops and their bosses completely. I think that will happen no matter what in this case though. At least I hope so.\n\nI have to admit that I would probably settle for less than 250m. But you have to remember that after taxes and court/legal fees the family is likely to only get about 10 million. So they probably had to aim high in their suit to get enough cash to make it worthwhile. Yeah probably. But so what? You'd rather the cops get away with hand cuffing a kid and fucking with him? You want that to be your kid? And if it were your kid wouldn't the very least you would settle for is enough money to make sure you and your family would never have to work another day in your lives? They do get away with it. I doubt anyone is going to be losing their job over this. Most likely he'll get some paid vacation time.\n\nWhat I'd rather is that they be held personally liable. The officers involved and the entire chain of command above them, and their union should be sued, not the taxpayers. Hmmmmm. Well the city power structure is ultimately responsible for how the cops behave though. They could easily have policies in place like, \"don't put cuffs on elementary school kids.\"\n\nBut you do make a good point. The cops should definitely be personally liable as well and should eat the brunt of these costs.  Yeah, but the city power structure is full of people. Those people should be the accountable ones, not their victims. I dunno man. The fact is that if we were a real community instead of just a group of people forced to be around each other then people within the community would be picketing the cops and making a ruckus about this. \n\nInstead nobody does shit and yeah the cops will probably get away with it. If people are going to stand by while children are abused by the states power structure then those people deserve to suffer. Everybody just goes on about their day either ignorant of this kind of shit or they just blithely assume it would never happen to them because their kid is better behaved, white, etc. It's bullshit and I got no sympathy for the New York tax payers. I somewhat agree, but I wouldn't go so far as to say anyone deserves being abused simply because they [or their neighbors] are too afraid to do anything about it. The state has real assault rifles, and they aren't afraid to use theirs. Yeah probably. But so what? You'd rather the cops get away with hand cuffing a kid and fucking with him? You want that to be your kid? And if it were your kid wouldn't the very least you would settle for is enough money to make sure you and your family would never have to work another day in your lives? We can punish the cops without it costing a quarter of a billion dollars.  ...aaaaand where do you think that $250M is coming from?\n\nFresh taxes ahoy!  It's a 7 year old kid! Who called the cops in the first place?     ",

Edit:  Lee got mobbed on all sides. :\\  Not exactly what I'd call a debate.\n\nTLDR anyone? Yeah, it was more of a discussion, not a debate.\n\ntl;dr Molyneux, who normally takes everything on principle, oddly enough is against IP only because it is unenforceable. Kokesh is against it being property at all because it's scarce (I hope he is just confused/mistaken and meant to say rivalrous). Tucker thinks the free market will work out how people will get by without IP laws. Other dude develops code, and as such he's biased into thinking he, or his employer under contract, owns the code.\n\n(this is OP btw, I am on a public computer, so I don't want to log into my regular account from here) &gt;Kokesh is against it being property at all because it's scarce (I hope he is just confused/mistaken and meant to say rivalrous).\n\nI think you meant to say not scarce and non-rivalrous. The two are interrelated. IP is not scarce because it is non-rivalrous.  I did mean to say \"non-rivalrous\".\n\nI agree they are interrelated. At a certain point, something can be so scarce that it becomes rivalrous. But, in general, a thing's scarcity mainly effects its price/value. Rivalry is what creates a reason to claim a thing as property (to exclude its use from others). \n\nFor example, the reason I claim the chair I'm sitting on as property is so I don't have a lack of a place to sit when I need to use my computer. If my chair could be used by me and anyone else a the same time, I wouldn't need to claim it; I could just use it. It should be noted that there could hypothetically exist, say, a trillion chairs at a given time, and yet I would still claim at least one as property. They would be ridiculously cheap, but I still have to own one because I need to be able to use it and stop others from using it when I need to sit.\n\n*(btw, not sure if you were actually in conflict with me about the notion of rivalry creating the need for property, but I went there anyway -- at least a third party might get something out of it in that case) We're on the same page on everything except the definition of scarce and the relationship between scarce things and rivalrous things.\n\nNot being scarce means we have functionally infinite of something. All non-rivalrous goods not scarce because since everybody can have it or use it, we can make infinite copies. There are some things that are rivalrous, but not scarce because there is so much. Air comes to mind as a decent example.\n\nSo basically non-rivalry implies non-scarcity. \n\nMost people argue that scarcity rather than rivalry is the reason for property rights. If we had access to infinite amounts of rivalrous goods, we probably wouldn't need property rights. However, because non-rivalry implies non-scarcity which implies no need for property rights, logically, it is correct to say that there is no reason for property rights in non-rivalrous goods.\n\nHowever, it doesn't quite work the opposite way. I don't agree with your statement that:\n\n&gt;Rivalry is what creates a reason to claim a thing as property (to exclude its use from others).\n\nIn a world of infinite popcorn, I don't think we would need property rights in popcorn even though it is rivalrous because we both can't eat the same piece. Imagine if a bag just floated around next to everyone that never emptied. I wouldn't care if anyone took my popcorn because I would have infinite amounts all the time.\n\nIn the case of IP, you can basically treat scarce and rivalrous as perfect substitutes for each other in 98% of these kind of discussions because IP is both not scarce and non-rivalrous and the rationale for why that makes it not property is essentially the same. You seem to be implying that non-scarcity means something is available at no cost. This is not true. To look at your example, non-scarce popcorn simply means that there's infinite potential  to get more, not that getting more involves no labor. If I've homesteaded a bag of popcorn, it's the fact that anyone else eating that popcorn deprives me of what I've homesteaded that makes me desire to defend that popcorn. If I could let you eat my popcorn without its being consumed, I'd have no need to defend it. That's rivalry, not scarcity.\n\nIf there's infinite land available, then land is not scarce. But land can only be used for a finite number of purposes at a time, some of which are mutually exclusive. Are you really arguing that in this world of non-scarcity but rivalry that there would be no need for property rights?

The term can confusingly be used like the word \"hot\". The stove is hot, but not even close to how hot the sun is. Gold is scarce, but it's not as scarce as platinum.\n\n&gt;So basically non-rivalry implies non-scarcity.\n\nI agree, and I don't think I said anything to conflict with this (at least I hope I didn't).\n\n&gt;If we had access to infinite amounts of rivalrous goods, we probably wouldn't need property rights.\n\nYou still need to claim it as property if it is rivalrous. Going back to my chair example, even if there are 8 trillion chairs, I still need to claim one so I have a place to sit. Otherwise someone could come and remove it out from under me as I was sitting down and I'd fall on my ass. We both can't use the same one. The lack of scarcity just means they're so cheap that it's easy to claim one, and not a big deal to defend the claim (e.g. \"Hey, man, I need this chair. If you need one, there's a few right outside you can have. But this one is mine, at least for right now.\").\n\n&gt;There are some things that are rivalrous, but not scarce because there is so much. Air comes to mind as a decent example.\n\nYou do have to claim some air as your property (i.e. exclude its use by others) when you inhale some and use the oxygen within it to sustain yourself. It's just that no one bothers to challenge your claim because there's so much of it (and they know you need it and if they want you to survive they will let you have it; also, they know you would defend your claim with as much force as you could muster, because it would be a matter of life and death).\n\n&gt;In a world of infinite popcorn, I don't think we would need property rights in popcorn even though it is rivalrous because we both can't eat the same piece.\n\nSame thing. You do have to claim the popcorn you actually consume. You must necessarily exclude its use by others. It's just that other people probably don't care because they can easily get their own.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't care if anyone took my popcorn because I would have infinite amounts all the time.\n\nImagine if they kept taking your popcorn as you were attempting to put it into your mouth. You'd probably get pissed really quickly. Hey, don't get mad, bro. It's not your property, so how can you get upset when other people take it? See my point? You claim a small portion of the infinite supply when you consume it. That portion is yours; you exclude its use by others. &gt;Well, I would nitpick by saying there's different levels of scarcity. The term can confusingly be used like the word \"hot\". The stove is hot, but not even close to how hot the sun is. Gold is scarce, but it's not as scarce as platinum.\n\nSure it can be used that way, but the important distinction is scarce vs. not scarce or in your example hot vs. cold. Just because it is a spectrum doesn't mean the important distinction can't be binary.\n\n&gt;You still need to claim it as property if it is rivalrous. Going back to my chair example, even if there are 8 trillion chairs, I still need to claim one so I have a place to sit. Otherwise someone could come and remove it out from under me as I was sitting down and I'd fall on my ass. We both can't use the same one. The lack of scarcity just means they're so cheap that it's easy to claim one, and not a big deal to defend the claim (e.g. \"Hey, man, I need this chair. If you need one, there's a few right outside you can have. But this one is mine, at least for right now.\").\n\nIsn't making me fall out of my chair a violation of the property rights in my body? I don't see how pulling a chair out from under me is any different than pushing me over.\n\nSecondly, you could say that while chairs in general are scarce, chairs I am currently sitting in are not. In fact, there can never be more than few even if I were to lay out across them.\n\n&gt;You do have to claim some air as your property (i.e. exclude its use by others) when you inhale some and use the oxygen within it to sustain yourself. It's just that no one bothers to challenge your claim because there's so much of it (and they know you need it and if they want you to survive they will let you have it; also, they know you would defend your claim with as much force as you could muster, because it would be a matter of life and death).\n\nOnce again, I'm not sure that you can challenge my claim to the air I am currently breathing without violating property rights in my body. I can't imagine how you take that air without choking or suffocating me. In such an act, surely your attempt to kill me is more important than who owns the air.\n\nThe non-scarcity of physical things I'm currently using also comes into play here. Air in general might be scarce, but air I am currently in the process of breathing is not.\n\nFinally, I would argue that air I am currently breathing is a part of me. I think most people would agree that an oxygen molecule in my blood is a part of me while one floating in the air around me or outside is not. The two obvious transition points are once it is in my mouth and when it transitions from a gas into having been absorbed into my blood through my lungs. \n\nIf you think about just about any object other than air, the obvious transition point is my mouth. It's arguable that my property rights in my body even entitle me to some small perimeter around my body. But I think if you stick and object in my mouth or nose or ear, you've violated my property rights in my body even if it doesn't touch me.\n\nAnd I think all of the above arguments apply to the popcorn scenario as well. I won't bother repeating them.\n\nFinally, if you CTRL+f in Kinsella's book Against Intellectual Property (http://library.mises.org/books/Stephan%20Kinsella/Against%20Intellectual%20Property.pdf), you will find that 100 words start with \"scarc\" almost all of which are some form of scarce or scarcity. Not a single word starts with \"rival\". Since that book is basically the foundation of this argument as applied to IP, in the context of our discussion, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the literature is clearly on my side. &gt;Isn't making me fall out of my chair a violation of the property rights in my body?\n\nI don't see how.\n\n&gt;you could say that while chairs in general are scarce, chairs I am currently sitting in are not. \n\nI think you meant that the opposite way, i.e. chairs are not scarce, but chairs you're sitting in are.\n\nRegardless, you just acknowledged that rivalry is the key. In your example, *you are reducing the scarcity such that it is now rivalrous*. At the point where it becomes rivalrous, that's when it is worthy of being claimed as property. \n\n&gt;Once again, I'm not sure that you can challenge my claim to the air I am currently breathing without violating property rights in my body. I can't imagine how you take that air without choking or suffocating me.\n\nYou're in a sealed room, and I suck out all the air. If none of that air is your property, then it isn't a violation to remove it from your vicinity. Obviously a single molecule of air/atmosphere is rivalrous; only one person can extract the oxygen from it. You must claim enough air to survive as your property if you do, in fact, want to survive. Even though air is, in general, so cheap that no one bothers making overt claims of it, you do have to own some; you do have to exclude its use by others.\n\n&gt;Since that book is basically the foundation of this argument as applied to IP, in the context of our discussion, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the literature is clearly on my side.\n\nThen I should like to have a word with him. I think he is as confused as many other anti-IP folks. &gt;I don't see how.\n\nWhat is the difference between pulling a chair out from underneath me and pushing me out of the chair?\n\n&gt;I think you meant that the opposite way, i.e. chairs are not scarce, but chairs you're sitting in are.\n\nYes. My mistake.\n\n&gt;Regardless, you just acknowledged that rivalry is the key. In your example, you are reducing the scarcity such that it is now rivalrous. At the point where it becomes rivalrous, that's when it is worthy of being claimed as property.\n\nAren't I increasing the scarcity by reducing the number? And if goods are scarce at all they can't be not scarce.\n\nWe agree about the status of rivalrous and scare goods and non-rivalrous and non-scarce goods. We agree that scarce and non-rivalrous goods can't exist. The question is about a hypothetical rivalrous but not scarce good. If all scarce or rivalrous goods must be both and all not scarce or not rivalrous goods must be neither then they are perfect substitutes and there is no meaningful distinction for our purposes.\n\nI don't really think that rivalrous, non-scarce goods exist in an absolute sense. There are only circumstances where goods function that way. It is always possible to change the circumstances the goods no longer functionally scarce.\n\n&gt;You're in a sealed room, and I suck out all the air. If none of that air is your property, then it isn't a violation to remove it from your vicinity.\n\nThis would cause me to explode. It's murder via depressurization. It's like pulling my body apart, but everywhere at once via a physics trick.\n\n&gt;Obviously a single molecule of air/atmosphere is rivalrous; only one person can extract the oxygen from it. You must claim enough air to survive as your property if you do, in fact, want to survive. Even though air is, in general, so cheap that no one bothers making overt claims of it, you do have to own some; you do have to exclude its use by others.\n\nThinking about this leads me to believe that breathing air can't be considered taking ownership of it. I'm currently breathing in air that someone else exhaled recently. Perhaps some of the atoms underwent a transformation by a plant from carbon dioxide into oxygen in the meantime, but if breathing truly meant ownership, you would have to have some sort of Marxist / more mutualist conception of ownership where you relinquished ownership as soon as you stopped using it.\n\nI think my interpretation where those molecules of air temporarily become a part of your body leads to philosophical conclusions much more consistent with libertarian property rights theory.\n\nEvery libertarian property rights framework for privatizing air or water that I have read has been based upon homesteading some of the existing physical properties of the air or water rather than the molecules themselves. \n Yeah, it was more of a discussion, not a debate.\n\ntl;dr Molyneux, who normally takes everything on principle, oddly enough is against IP only because it is unenforceable. Kokesh is against it being property at all because it's scarce (I hope he is just confused/mistaken and meant to say rivalrous).

Other dude develops code, and as such he's biased into thinking he, or his employer under contract, owns the code.\n\n(this is OP btw, I am on a public computer, so I don't want to log into my regular account from here) Yeah, it was more of a discussion, not a debate.\n\ntl;dr Molyneux, who normally takes everything on principle, oddly enough is against IP only because it is unenforceable.

Just like if you write a book you own that book. Computer code exists as a series of magnetic fields recorded to a metal disk platter in your computer, or a series of electronic switches if you are using a SSD. These magnetic impulses represent 'ones' and 'zeros' and when read and executed by a computer's central processor they perform a number of calculations. \n\nHe, or his employer, owns the drive, they own the magnetic fields on that drive. They have every right to demand payment for that drive, or demand payment for allowing access to the information container in their drive or on their network.  They can require conditions and limitations on a person's actions if that person voluntarily agrees to those conditions as a stipulation for accessing that information. As a programmer he can also demand payment in return for his services as a programmer. \n\nAll that stuff is perfectly legit, does not violate NAP, and does not depend on 'IP law' in any way shape or form.  Nor does it resemble how IP law works, what it does, and what it is for. Can you hold a third party responsible if he has agreed to no conditions or limitations and downloads a copy of the software from someone who has violated said conditions and limitations? Yeah, it was more of a discussion, not a debate.\n\ntl;dr Molyneux, who normally takes everything on principle, oddly enough is against IP only because it is unenforceable.

My problem with IP, regardless of our current statist laws surrounding it, is that copying is what humans do by nature. Everything we do from when we are born is mimicking what we have seen other people do. To deny someone from reverse engineering something you have created is like trying to say \"you can't learn how to walk because I was the first one to think of it and I would like to be compensated for transmitting the concept of walking to you\".

No, defense is a service, and like any other service, it is best provided on a free market with competition with the highest quality service and the lowest price. We normally call these groups \"~~Defense~~ Dispute Resolution Organizations\" or DRO's. The objection people always come up with to that is \"but then you just have another gang and have a battle between warlords, so there needs to be a monopoly in defense to prevent war\" or something to that effect, but consider this: we currently do not have a total monopoly of defense in the world. Canada can sit right next to the USA without each country breaking out into war. People under Canadian law can go through the US and people under US law can go through Canada, while they are all under different \"DRO's\". These countries settle their differences in law peacefully. If we can break countries down to that, why not New York live peacefully with the the US? Or New York City with New York? Why can't we break it down to city, to county, to neighborhoods, to households, to persons? We reject that there needs to be a \"supreme\" law for law to exist.\n\n2. No, short of geographical limitations, monopolies always form by government-granted privileges. \"Anti-trust\" legislation is really just a tool for special interest groups. The flaw becomes more evident when you see that it covers every type of situation in the market. Selling above market price makes you a \"price gouger\" and an \"exploiter\". Selling below the market price means you're \"undercutting\" and using \"anti-competitive tactics. Selling at the market prices means you're \"colluding\" with other businesses.

Read the rest if you want too, its quite good. &gt;Canada can sit right next to the USA without each country breaking out into war.\n\nCanada and the United States don't go to war sure, but the world is in a perpetual state of war.  The lack of a global government would seem to be anarcho-capitalism being played out on a macro-scale. States continually disregard others for their own benefit.\n\nTake for instance the first Gulf War,  Iraq invaded Kuwait which drew an almost immediate reaction from the United States, and other western nations. They weren't defending Kuwait on any moral basis or even because the law said that they had to, they simply wanted to secure their own economic interests.  There are countless points in history where similar scenarios have been played out. There are however very few instances where states will take action in defense of those who are unable to provide them with some sort of economic benefit. \n\nDoes this mean in an anarcho-capitalist world justice is nothing more than a service provided to the highest bidder? If this is the case it would seem that those with the most resources would have a get out of jail free card. \n\nTake for instance the second Gulf War. The United States, again, was acting in its own interest despite cries of wrong doing from other nations. Despite these protests no political or economic harm came against the United States. Because the United States had the resources to not only defend itself, but also the economic leverage to deter any would be Iraqi rescuers. Iraq didn't have the same resources, as the United States, and was quickly defeated.\n\nIs what the United States did any less unjust, simply because they could afford to defend themselves?  The United States has the ability to inflict its will on others simply because, it has no fear of competition. Thus it would appear that in an anarcho-capitalist world might, or the ability to afford might, makes right.\n\n&gt;We reject that there needs to be a \"supreme\" law for law to exist.\n\nThere has never been laws controlling the actions of states, and they act in manner that reflects the lack of laws restricting their actions. There has never been a point in history were violent conflict wasn't taking place. Look at Europe, being constantly torn apart by war. This trend of European conflict took place right up until the creation of the European Union. Which sought to create security through the joint economic gain of its members. Laws controlling the members' actions in economic areas, led to spillover into all facets European law. These laws are backed with actual repercussions, and penalties should they be broken. What has been created is a *de facto* federation of states, which governs the member states, in order to maintain security. \n\nIt would seem that safety in numbers still applies in an anarcho-capitalist world. Once people, groups, or states decide to band together for safety it seems the next logical step would be rules to govern the newly formed group to insure their new found safety. \n\nIn conclusion the idea of anarcho-capitalism is brand new to me so forgive me if I misunderstood any of its points.\n\n**tl;dr** It seems to me that it will all resort back to something pretty similar to what we currently have, or actually anarchy.\n\n  Hey, no worries! No argument started.\n\nOn protection (police, courts, and national defense) see here:\n\nhttp://candlemind.com/projects/progclub/file/michael/getEducated.php?listID=16\n\nEspecially the first two.\n\nOn monopolies - nope. Evil monopolies cannot exist on the free market. Only when government creates them do they last.\n\nI would write more, but I'm in a bit of a hurry. [deleted]      Monopolies can only form by agreements, not by market forces. And anarcho-capitalism is not about destroying a strong government but having multiple different ones to choose from, so the army could still exist.    ",

    "snippet" : "Basically, how much would I hate doing that?\n\nI recently was introduced to AnCap this summer and took to it. However, I was already interested in economics before, and had taken a class. I thoroughly enjoyed that, but likely more for the discussion than the content itself.\n\nI understand that virtually everything will be Keynes in college, but will there be any areas to be more exploring, or is that just a daydream?\n\nI don't doubt that learning the different perspective would hurt, but is it even tolerable after too long?\n\nThanks to anyone who answers.\n\nEdit. To clarify, I have had interests in linguistics and anthropology as well, but economics has really caught my attention as extremely interesting and likely more \"usable\" than linguistics outside of an academic perspective.\n\nI do plan to go to college. I have already applied and am waiting response from some, and have gotten in one. The one I did get into does not offer linguistics as a degree, so I feel like I would get more out of economics than anthropology.\n\nI would also consider double majoring in linguistics and Econ at one of the other schools that I might still get into.\n\nNone of the ones I've applied to are particularly free-market according to the sources many of you shared. But it seems as if for undergrad, very few offer that perspective anyway, and that is more a graduate focus.\n\nI ideally would study one of either Econ or linguistics into graduate study, as I really enjoy academia. I understand that one can attain and share knowledge without letters behind one's name, but I see that as a plausible and fulfilling pursuit for me.\n\nIf studying Econ, I would possibly apply to the summer mises institute to get an alternate perspective as well.\n\nIn the end, I don't really know what I'd be getting myself into, and if anyone else has any insight into collegiate economics, or other related comments, I thank you for sharing.  Its going to depend on where you go to school. A quick google search yielded this [article](http://www.superscholar.org/rankings/economics/top-austrian-free-market-programs/) on good economics programs with at least some representation of the austrians.\n\nI don't know personally, I didn't major in econ, but I could see a lot of the ideas that are taught in a Keynesian biased program still being generally applicable and true to a certain extent. The issues you'll disagree are in government intervention into the market. It'll be up to you to decide the arguments you hear from the Keynesian professors are legitimate or not.\n\nBut, its always, **always**, a good idea to hear the opposite side's arguments so you learn how to argue against them and to further understand the subject matter in general.  Do you know if UVa is still free market as hinted in this article? I know Coase was a professor there a while ago, and I'm waiting to hear back about acceptance from them as well. If you're in Virginia, GMU is a no-brainer. It would be if I didn't miss the application deadline...  I suspect that if you are interested in economics, it would be a decent experience. It doesn't seem much different than majoring in World Religions if you don't believe in most or any of the religions.   There are some very pro-Austrian colleges out there. George Mason University and Grove City College particularly come to mind.    Can you tell us a bit more yourself? Like your career plans, your interests etc. Otherwise any advice is not going to be very targeted  If it's between anthropology and economics... take economics. Math is better than Marx. True. Or in linguistics praising Chomsky.\n\nAnd math is generally awesome. If you're going to go the math route, just do CS. You can get some formal language theory in there (OK, that includes a bit of Chomsky, though we really only mentioned him once or twice in my whole program). Plus, it's usually easy to pick up some sort of Math minor, and being able to say your degree is in Computer Science and Math is far more badass than just saying \"I'm a math major.\"\n\nAnd no, I'm not biased in any way. This is all purely objective. BS in Math here. The above is verified as true. True. Or in linguistics praising Chomsky.\n\nAnd math is generally awesome.   So you are hesitant to major in Econ in college because it will most likely be antithetical with your (very recently found) Anacho-Capitalist views?  Wut?          ",

    "snippet" : "  This is why I prefer voluntaryist. It's a name that describes succinctly what we believe in which is voluntary exchanges through the Non-Aggression Principle. Voluntaryism is definitely a harder position to argue against, the statists have to think, are we really arguing against voluntary exchanges? \n\nAnarcho-capitalism is more of a prediction about what we believe to be the inevitable end result if the NAP is applied fully. But a voluntaryist society wouldn't necessarily be capitalist, it could equally house socialist communities - these wouldn't be a problem so long as they were voluntary.\n\n  Fuck you man. I tried to click on that cookie monster link and the video wasn't there!\n\nYou only build my hopes up to break them. I feel the same way. I hate the internet today.\n\n[Here, have a cookie monster video anyway. Kowabunga!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGSzqqcl62c)  \n[Double bonus cookie monster!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAqGGpj0Ans)   We need an antonym for monopoly. Polypoly?\n\nEDIT:  Actually thinking about the word \"monopoly,\" it is really just a 1 to many relationship. One organization deals in many things.  Possibly \"polymono\" is a many to 1 relationship.  Many organizations dealing with 1 good or service.  Polypoly would be many to many, many organizations doing 1 or many things.  However all of these terms sound absurd. I though about \"polypoly\" also. It seems awkward, but it has no negative connotations because, is has no connotations as no one uses it.  A proponent of polypoly I guess would be a polypolist. Sounds kind of funny, but not bad. The philosophy of polypoly would be polypolism.  Sounds funny also.  Probably don;t need to use polypolism just polypoly,  \"Polypoly\" is shorter than \"anarcho-capitalism\" so that is a plus.\n\nThe other options could be:\n\ncompetition:  has negative connotations\n\nchoice: Probably to vague. People can chose between political parties, but that is not the choice we mean. \n \nThese need other words to go with them though.\n\nLike competitive governance,, or competitive law, or choice in governance to communicate more what we mean so it get longer.\n\nMaybe polypoly is not so bad. Reading \"polypoly\" just makes me laugh.  I would love to see someone's face after this\n\n \"Are you a conservative or a liberal?!\" \n\n\"I am a Polypolist\" \n\nSounds like Polly pocket or something.  We should give it a trial run or something.\n\nChoice: I do not think it would work, Abortion has a monopoly (possibly monomono) on the word choice.\n\nMaybe just Polyism? We talk about polycentric law, removing monopolies in every situation.  We always are saying more is better, more competition, more voluntary actors in any system.\n\nIdk Polyist sounds stupid though. How should the emphasis be?\n\nMonopoly is usualy said like: mon-opoly instead of mono-poly\n\nPolypoly could said: poly-poly or pol-ypoly\n\nI think poly-poly sounds best. Poly-poly for sure.  Pol-i-poly sounds ... like we are trying too hard.\n\nWhat about Polypolist though, should it be poly-polist?  Might as well I guess, go big or go home. I reserved a subreddit: [r/Polypoly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Polypoly/)  Poly-poly for sure.  Pol-i-poly sounds ... like we are trying too hard.\n\nWhat about Polypolist though, should it be poly-polist?  Might as well I guess, go big or go home.  The post ignores market Anarchism entirely by stating that capital will be *privately* owned under a freedom of exchange. \n\nIt also misrepresents Socialism to a degree. Socialists don't want to tax the rich, they want to tax the capitalists. And while this may seem like one in the same, there *is* a difference. If there is a rich working class citizen, why would the socialists tax him/her? The idea isn't to flat line wealth, it's to prevent a perceived theft from creating the wealth inequalities of Capitalism (some wealth inequalities will exist so long as a market does).\n\nI do agree that it makes the libertarian capitalist ideology more clear if it is presented as \"anti-monopolist\" rather than \"'anarcho'-capitalist\".\n\nThe \"anarcho\" prefix isn't a necessity, really. I mean, when have you ever seen an ideology with a prefix of \"minarcho\" for a minarchist ideology (such as Georgism)? &gt;The post ignores market Anarchism entirely by stating that capital will be privately owned under a freedom of exchange.\n\nWhy is market anarchism exclusive to the private ownership of capital? If people are free to own property and exchange as they please (market anarchism), they might find it useful to own capital exclusively rather than always placing it under collective management. Maybe they won't, but if the option is institutionally prohibited, than how is that anarchism and where is the institution deriving its means and rights?\n\n&gt;It also misrepresents Socialism to a degree.

The idea isn't to flat line wealth, it's to prevent a perceived theft from creating the wealth inequalities of Capitalism (some wealth inequalities will exist so long as a market does).\n\nAnarcho-capitalists would argue that private ownership is not theft, and I would argue that socialists do in fact want to tax the rich. They want to tax the rich because their ideology is based in envy number one, and number two because capitalists will always be the rich and the rich will always be capitalists. The reason for this is that the most risky, uncertain, and vital dynamic of a technological society is the prudent assessment of capital investment. Capitalists are rewarded most highly because their role is the most far reaching and important. Essentially, they are the forecasters of the future economy. I'm of course speaking of entrepreneurial capitalists rather than crony capitalists.\n\nI can imagine a market anarchy situation where other types of roles grow in importance. A famous author or artist may become quite wealthy, but is not a capitalist. In general though, wealth and prudent investment goes hand in hand. Whether it's material wealth or spiritual, those who save and spend wisely will be richest. &gt;Why is market anarchism exclusive to the private ownership of capital?

I'm a libertarian socialist and I don't envy the capitalists. And also, if a capitalist is unable to be a successful businessman, he will be poor.

Capitalists are rewarded most highly because their role is the most far reaching and important. Essentially, they are the forecasters of the future economy.

Workers can manage themselves, so capitalists aren't *the* forecasters of the future economy, they're just forecasters, and they aren't even necessarily the most efficient.\n\n&gt;I can imagine a market anarchy situation where other types of roles grow in importance. A famous author or artist may become quite wealthy, but is not a capitalist. In general though, wealth and prudent investment goes hand in hand. Whether it's material wealth or spiritual, those who save and spend wisely will be richest.\n\nThe thing is, for me at least, that saving becomes obsolete when the cost of goods is cheap along with a non-appropriated labor value market economy. The reason most people save today is because the currency is screwed up, labor does not sell at market-product level, and because of Consumerism. This isn't to say that the pooling of resources for more costly long term ventures is obsolete, quite the contrary, actually. &gt;Well, for one thing, no anarchist school (except for the anarcho-capitalists themselves) considers Anarcho-Capitalism as a form of Anarchism to begin with. So, from there, it follows that market Anarchism is explicitly against private ownership.\n\nThat doesn't follow. The question is what a market would do in the absence of a state. Anarcho-capitalism is simply predicting that people will engage in capitalism.  Well, the premise we're going under is that Anarchism is a bit more than just being anti-State. Okay, I'll accept that premise for the sake of the conversation. You are likely referring to the \"anti-hierarchy\" idea. Anarcho-capitalists would argue either that capitalism is not essentially hierarchical or that if it is, the market lacking a state will produce the optimal level of capitalism and hierarchy. &gt;Why is market anarchism exclusive to the private ownership of capital?
