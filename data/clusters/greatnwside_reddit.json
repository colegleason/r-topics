I thought that was the strangest solicitation and never even considered buying meat from the back of a white van -- but others there said they buy all of their meat from another vendor named \"Jesse\".  They raved about restaurant quality, delicious marinades and the convenience of delivery.  Have I been missing something?  Do you buy meat from the back of a van?   Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality. Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality.  I've had a meat van guy come to my front door. He got pissy with me when I told him no. \"Wat'sa matter, buddy, don't you eat meat?! I could see the van parked down the street. It had the name of the company and a picture of various meat products so I felt he was legit. OTH, we occasionally get guys cruising the alley in unmarked cars selling it out of their trunks. As much as I love a good cut of meat, I'm not about to stand over some strange guy's car trunk parked in the alley. But yet you trust some bigass store's styrofoam platter and Saran wrap presentation. At least from the trunk you can put the meat up to your nose and also smell the cooler they are using to carry it around in.  Got word that the meat van is rolling thru today -- I'm lined up to buy a box of steaks.  Woo hooo!! Let us know what cuts you buy and your critique of their product. Exactly - want to hear about it!  I want a meat van to come by my place...   Very common in the city. Usually they say its extra boxes leftover etc. I figure they just buy it cheap and hustle. I've seen small sedans packed with white boxes driving around.\n    \n Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Yup, Ive never bought from them, especially since they do this in the summer heat... However I hear the meats good, prices are decent too. Ill probably roll the dice one of these days.   After reading this thread...I'm almost embarrassed to say that every once in awhile we buy meat from some traveling salesman.  They generally show up on Friday afternoon.  Knock on the door - tell us about all our neighbors buying this way.  Seem to have an official looking van.  Fail. If the van is refrigerated and the meat was good quality, I don't think it's a fail at all!  Aside from someone trying to sell me shrimp out of the trunk of a Buick on 95th and Ashland, I'm embarrassed to say I've just never been exposed to the traveling meat purveyor.  I gotta get out more! :) - it seems like good stuff - no complaints!  That and Costco...my meat buying experiences.  I'm going to send them your way next time....:) I'm going to hunt down this Jesse guy who works Milwaukee Avenue over here.  The ladies at the salon highly recommend him.  I probably wouldn't even open the door if one of these guys showed up unexpectedly at my door.  I'm a Costco freakoid.  The traveling meat van is a bit pricey (despite all the claims of restaurant quality).  I do better @ Costco - but laziness kick in at times and the convenience factor, Friday afternoon, tired and hungry, etc - cave.   I would like to meet Jessie - he might be better!\n I'm going to hunt down this Jesse guy who works Milwaukee Avenue over here.  The ladies at the salon highly recommend him.

Do you know of an honest wheel guy?  I've never had occasion to require the services of one, but I've found this.\n\nhttp://www.chicagowheelrepair.com/\n\n That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E. That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E.  i assume the rim job included remounting and rebalance of the wheel and it was done in less then a couple hours, seems like a good deal, if you got a rim from the junkyard and had to remount the tire and rebalance it, it would probably be close to the same price and more time spent going the junkyard route. Rim job?  Is the wheel steel or aluminum? Steel is fixable most of the time. Aluminum Is very risky to fix, so much that not a lot of shops will fix them.  go here in the neighborhood:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago While they do not repair wheels or straighten bent rims, it is a worthwhile place for used OEM replacement wheels at a decent price or to have a flat fixed. I go elsewhere for everything else. once a rim is bent you'd really want to just replace it, not knock it back into shape then mount a tire on it. Depending on the extent of the damage, they are quite repairable in the hands of a skilled tech with the right equipment. and where would we find one of these guys around here to work on a stock steel rim or an alloy one?\n\nAlso how do you \"bend a rim\" and not do other suspension or steering damage? go here in the neighborhood:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago I always go to Majestic.

There was someone in the post mentioning how security gave him and/or a friend a \"pass\" to sell drugs in the theater.\n\nEddie's got a serious uphill battle with the City at this point. This would be one of them.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/16orza/congress_theater_eddie_carranza_one_big_load_of/\n\nPay special attention to the hidden comments that \"score below the threshold\". Wow Jazmine has a fancy new title -- projects manager.  Fitting because the Congress reminds one of the projects.  I like how Eddie compares his security team selling confiscated drugs to a speeding ticket. Wow the article was altered to remove the speeding ticket comment and make it seem like he takes the violations more seriously. Since the author (as opposed to \"reporter\") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously. Don't make judgement yet. Victoria the writer said to me she didn't alter the original article. she's asking her editors. Doesn't matter whether it was the author OR the editors. It was altered. I've asked who and why and will post what I find out.  It was kind of a puff piece anyway. Boy was it ever. There was opportunity for a good follow up when the pr person said that at least the bathroom ceilings weren't caving in:  \"what kind of structural work have you done on the theater?\" Because that kind of news would be useful. Painting a few places or swapping out some drywall isn't what I would consider major work - it's cosmetic. But if the cosmetics were delayed all this time because they needed to go in and fix structural things, that would be something I could respect. But that's not what we got in this piece, and it's the second puff piece out of DNAinfo on this subject. I wonder if they require their writers to have journalism degrees. Since the author (as opposed to \"reporter\") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously. He is known for saying provocative things, but maybe he saw how cavalier it looked in print.  ",

    "snippet" : "I'm looking for some insight as to what this part of Irving Park/Independence Park is like, it's the area bounded by N: Montrose, W: Elston, E:Kimball, S: Irving Park.  I'm familiar with, and lived in, Irving Park before but further west on the other side of the expressway and my only ventures over this way are to restaurants and the park.\n\nThe WBEZ gang map says this is prime \"Simon City Royals\" territory and while I take that with a grain of salt (apparently I have spent the last 10 years living in various gang territories without issue) I have a friend who used to live on Kimball there and said it was bad: lots of crime, gunshots, and gang activity.  Walking around at night was a no-no.\n\nThe street the house is on seems nice: well taken care of homes and lawns, no trash, and quiet.  I get the impression that a lot of the people who live there are older with kids or seniors.\n\nAnyone know what it's really like? The plan is to live in the house for a long time and I walk a lot.  Disclaimer: I don't live *exactly* there. I'm north of Montrose, but only one block and I walk down Hamlin to Elston fairly often. The crime really isn't that bad in this area in general. Before I moved to Albany Park, everyone was warning me about gangs. I have never once had to worry about anything here and I have (stupidly) stumbled home drunk at 3 a.m. a few times (which I don't recommend).\n\nAlmost all gang violence is gang-on-gang in this area. Very rarely do non-gang-members get shot. It is kind of quiet in the area, but I love it here. I am planning on moving to the other side of Kimball soon just to be closer to the 'L' but other than that, I have zero issues here.\n\nEDIT: Also, you'd get to live in a place that's in the Albany Park neighborhood and the Irving Park community area. My first time in the area, I got kind of confused about which was which. Awesome, thank you.  I figured it's like most places: there's crime because it's a city and that's just how things are.  My friend's first hand account had me worried on top of the huge orange box of HEY THERE'S A GANG THERE from WBEZ.  Not so much concerned about a random drive by as feeling like I'm trapped in my home from living in a shitty environment, which is how I feel now over in Albany Park. No problem. Hope that helps.\n\nSo you currently live in AP and don't like the environment? Can I ask which side you live on? I'm between Lawrence and Foster, off Kedzie.  My main beef is that it's ridiculously trashy, as in, garbage everywhere on the streets.  My ten minute walk to the brown line is like walking through a landfill and I've watched people leave bottles or trash on the sidewalks.  People don't care about their homes, lawns, cars, businesses, nothing.  It just feels run down and like everyone gave up.  I moved over here thinking I could go for walks like I did in Irving, go to the park by the river, but I just feel depressed looking outside.  The area west to Kimball looks much nicer but between Fransisco and Kedzie it's kind of a shithole. Good to know. My block is hit and miss. I'm off of Central Park near Sunnyside and it's block by block here. I generally don't go north of Lawrence. I'm mostly on Kedzie or Lawrence, or walking to the Brown Line from here. But yeah, the trash can suck sometimes.  I think EB Chris lives over by dere, maybe he will weigh in. I meant Chris from EB.  He says it's much better than it was two years ago.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/SixCornersChicago/comments/15s8yh/ever_been_banned_from_everyblockcom/\n I'm travelling this week, will write more when I return. Yes, I live in the heart of that area, and have as a single family home owner for 5 years now. Prior I lived as a renter in Logan for 13 years.\n\nI like it for the most part. 2 years ago though, we had some bad problems, mainly confined to 4000 block of Bernard, and 4100 block of Monticello, all gang related.\n\nSCR's are so weak now its a joke. Most active gang is SGD, and they are active, though have now taken more root north of Montrose.\n\nOur area has been very quiet now for a year, honest.\n\nWe have a VERY strong neighborhood group in these boundaries that is purely anti crime, IPCNA, meets monthly.\n\nBeing able to walk to tony's for grcoceries, by gadren supplies at garden center, walk to blue line, home depot and target nearby are god sends.\n\nThe biggest ongoing trouble area is north side of Montrose ans Kimball and cullom corner.\n\nThat help. Please don't hesitate asking anything you can think of, just be patient on my response as I'm travelling. But I am very active in community and caps and can give you the low down.

Prior I lived as a renter in Logan for 13 years.\n\nI like it for the most part. 2 years ago though, we had some bad problems, mainly confined to 4000 block of Bernard, and 4100 block of Monticello, all gang related.\n\nSCR's are so weak now its a joke. Most active gang is SGD, and they are active, though have now taken more root north of Montrose.\n\nOur area has been very quiet now for a year, honest.\n\nWe have a VERY strong neighborhood group in these boundaries that is purely anti crime, IPCNA, meets monthly.\n\nBeing able to walk to tony's for grcoceries, by gadren supplies at garden center, walk to blue line, home depot and target nearby are god sends.\n\nThe biggest ongoing trouble area is north side of Montrose ans Kimball and cullom corner.\n\nThat help. Please don't hesitate asking anything you can think of, just be patient on my response as I'm travelling. But I am very active in community and caps and can give you the low down. ",

    "snippet" : "The demise of EB gobbled up several bookmarked threads, including one where I sought advice on a decent, affordable company to give me a quote on a sewer check valve and/or additional flood control apparatus.\n\nThis thread is an attempt to reconstitute that resource, for my benefit and hopefully others who find their way here. This is a big-time home improvement job that many are no doubt considering.\n\nI'll go first.\n\nI had Xpert Flood Control come out and scope out my sewer. It was mercifully clear of roots and remarkably intact all the way to the street, no cracks or shifts or anything. Hurray! I asked for a quote on a flood control system and they presented me with The Cadillac as I refer to it, a $7600 package with more valves and electric pumps than I could shake a stick at.\n\nI'm looking for a cheaper, simpler option. Just a valve on my sewer line, with an access point in my yard so I can pop it open if it gets stuck. Called REI Plumbing (the only one I could remember from the old EB thread) twice and haven't yet received a return call.\n\nAny suggestions for who to call? ",

I mean I can see a whole block in the city or over the alley fence neighbors joining to keep in touch wih each other.  WIKIBLOCK post here: Waiting to see WikiBlocks terms of use &amp; privacy policy.  Looks very promising though. From what I know about WikiBlock (which is little) is the following:\n1) it's based on very very old code base of EB.  Like over 3 years old.  Most of the basic features we'd come to expect in EB won't be present in WB.\n2) the open source version is not wrapped up in a bow for an install.  It's patchy and kinda shoe stringed\n3) it appears to be written against AWS for an infrastructure, and appears to be kinda tethered to it.  AWS is the most robust and stable, but the most expensive.\n4) it appears to be only one person working on this at the moment, and the individual appears to be more of a business person than a hard core software engineer (from his linked in profile, if the whois that was registered is actually the person setting this up).  I would expect new features to be introduced at a snails pace.  I would expect terms of use and privacy policy to be far from this individual's mind.  I think just getting something up is his focus.  He's requested help from other devs, but as far as I know he hasn't gotten back to any (disclosure, I threw my hat in the ring to help as I have much experience with AWS infrastructure, and haven't heard anything back).\n\nJust what I know to keep expectations realistic.  Don't read this as criticizing this individual.  I thoroughly respect what this person is trying to do, and I am thoroughly impressed with what this individual has accomplished so far.\n Is AWS the Amazon thingy?  Not a geek.  I hope they contact you.  If you're the Chris with the DeNiro avatar, I've enjoyed your valuable content/contributions on EB. I'm sorry, I forget acronyms mean nothing to most people out of context.  Yes, AWS is Amazon Web Services.  It's a competitor on the cloud based computing front.  It's by far the best, and richest offering, but the most expensive service.  I have not delved deep into the WB code base, but the way they appeared to be storing avatars and images in the EB version used a AWS only feature, that says to me there are probably several constraints to AWS in the code base.  Personally, I favor AWS, but it puts a potential financial burden on an individual doing this if that is the case.  If set up right (redundancy, backups, load balancing, dev/stage/prod environments for rolling out new features, code repository, etc), with moderate traffic, I estimate anywhere from $500 to 2k a month for AWS charges once it's in full swing.\n\nI'm a Java/Spring guy, WB is a python/Django app.  I know very little about python, but do have interest.  Where I thought I might be able to help them is on the AWS side as I have experience with that while I come up to speed on Python.  Been looking for a community proj to be on, and this one just looks fun.\n\nYep, I was the Chris with the DeNiro avatar (and last two weeks of EB with D. Boon avatar).  I liked your posts too Glad, even though your nick was Glad2B, I always read it mentally as Gladys for some reason, which gave me the mental connection to someone I knew and like when I lived in Austin.  That was prob TMI.  Thanks for the comp. though! Wow, that's a lot of money for AWS.  I would pay $10/month for a good place.  Thanks for the explanation and deets.  If you end up going anywhere else, can you let me know?  Signed, Gladys Kravitz. Waiting to see WikiBlocks terms of use &amp; privacy policy.  Looks very promising though.

CircleSavvy didn't look that interesting to me last week, but just went there and looks like it is getting traction....maybe :).  I swear like a sailor in real life...so don't a problem with anything I have seen on Kenji's site or NWSide site.  That said, I have no tolerance for racist, sexist or anything else that demeans people of any shapes, sizes or color.  Back in EB days, I turned away from some of the homeless threads because I couldn't stand some of the comments and what seemed to be a complete disregard for humanity... likely stay here.  multitudes of other stuff to pass the time.  Multitudes.\n\nETA:  I'm just emphasizing the word multitudes, That Guy.  I won't post one word replies anymore to avoid clogging the thread.  That's prolly bad Reddiquette. Estimated time of arrival? likely stay here.  multitudes of other stuff to pass the time.  I will likely stay here as well.  I was at an open gov hack night last night and asked one of the original EB guys why there was not an outrage in the open community.  He seems to think there is and was kind enough to give me an addy for the eb guy that wrote the UIs for EB that we have grown to love. REDDIT post here: One good thing for me.....Taking advantage of another subreddit to bring news from the racing webzine. REDDIT post here: Reddit is hard to pick up, but still trying.  Not a fan of the crass, lewd and vulgar.  It's not that I can't take it (or dish it), just don't want to have to deal with peeps who want to interact this way on a reg basis.  Just stating my opinion.  There's Monty Python, then there's Workaholics.  I'm more Python.  every subreddit within reddit has it's own rules and reddiquette/netiquette. You are doing a disservice if you paint all of reddit as crass/lewd/vulgar, because it isn't. That is true.  To be honest, I will prolly most likely stay in Reddit.  I could do without the cussing (masking is fine), for example.  I don't want to tell people how to post, however, I think if you want a wider audience for GNWS, maybe something this fundamental could be implemented.  Or not.  at what age did you read A Catcher in the Rye? I read it every year and I started at 9.  My parents didn't know what I was reading.  Speaking of parents.  If I took them out to dinner and the next table over by us was having a convo complete with expletives, I would ask for another table.  My Dad could get salty, but the point is for me is that others behave with more consideration in public.  I would like GNWS to be a place I could ask my rents to go to follow up on stuff in the hood.  That's all. so if we wanted to make gnws g-rated how does it keep sanitized? eb had employees 365/24/7, people who got paid. there's no employees here. OK so you direct your parents to come to GNWS on reddit. what keeps them from finding the porn and other adult groups on reddit? two accidental clicks and they could have penis on the screen in front of them, easily. I'm up for talking about your idea though. Maybe you can start a new thread like, \"How would you make GNWS better?\"  I would post the cussing thing, or mask it (WTF or F*ck).  My rents may be able to handle that.  I would just tell them to go to GNWS and tell them not to stray too far from the cruise ship/resort and avoid venturing into town on a moped with half a tank of gas, they'll KWIM. You can bookmark just this subreddit for them.  That's what I do for convenience as I check it throughout the day. I read it every year and I started at 9.  My parents didn't know what I was reading.  Speaking of parents.  If I took them out to dinner and the next table over by us was having a convo complete with expletives, I would ask for another table.

I believe we can set the prefs so that if a post gets a certain amount of downvotes it disappears from the mainpage. You know about Reddit karma, right? at what age did you read A Catcher in the Rye?  Maybe I've missed it but I haven't seen much swearing in this subreddit yet. Maybe I've missed it but I haven't seen much swearing in this subreddit yet. Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker and Tits.\n\nBetter? I've never really understood why motherfucker was one of the 7.  It's still based on fuck, which is already in that list. I think the incest angle freaks people out.  It used to be that MF was the most offensive term of the bunch, but I think the c word has replaced it.  You can expect to be slapped if you use it. Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker and Tits.\n\nBetter? Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker and Tits.\n\nBetter?

However, I don't think they would join or stay if they joined with profanity or other such talk to be read...I'm just sayin' Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? Hard to say. I'm sure Tim's heard his share of salty language considering he used to be an electrician. Probably unlikely he'd be phased by it. Don't know about Arena.\n\nReddit in general is an oddball place for politicians. On the one hand, you've got polies, even Obama and Biden, posting AMA (ask me anythings) and answering questions. It's seen as a great place to connect with the unwashed masses. On the other hand, I don't know of many polies participating on a local level because it's a bit too personal. For instance, I've never seen an alderman post on r/Chicago.\n\nKnowing Kenji, he's probably extended the welcome mat to both of them already, but they may not feel comfortable with Reddit. May be best to have a happy medium in posting communications from them until the day they decide to join.\n Ha! \"phased\".....electrician pun! Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? To recap, posters on this subReddit will be allowed to use any of the swear words found in the inaugural post of Mr. Carlin for reasons beyond illustrative purposes which may include said words to be used against another poster.   There is now a Southeast Portage Park NextDoor.com section if you are between Addison-Belmont, Cicero-Laramie.\nhttps://southeastportagepark.nextdoor.com\nYou do not need to use a credit card to verify your address. There is an option to have the site call your home phone to verify the address, or you can have verification mailed to you.\nYou can also just show your street name in your profile and you can fudge your name if you feel the need. How many Portage Park enclaves are there?  Do you still get updates for just plain Portage Park, what about surrounding like Jeff Park, etc.? You enter your address to see if you are in an established area, if not you can create one and be the King (you set the borders)  ;-)\nThere are still a few open sections within the actual portage park neighborhood.\n\nHere is some info from nextdoor...\n\nThanks for your feedback on Nextdoor 2.0! We realize there is some confusion on the new Nearby Neighborhoods feature and thought it might be helpful to quickly answer the most frequently asked questions: \n\nDo I have to post my message to nearby neighborhoods? \nNo. You always have the option to post just to your neighborhood or to include nearby neighborhoods. \n\nCan neighbors from nearby neighborhoods see messages I have posted only to my neighborhood? \nNo. Posts just to your neighborhood are never displayed outside your neighborhood. \n\nCan neighbors from nearby neighborhoods see my profile? \nNo. Information about you is never shared outside your neighborhood unless you explicitly choose to post/reply/thank a message shared with nearby neighborhoods. \n\nIf you choose to post/reply/thank a message shared with nearby neighborhoods, then those neighbors will see a limited profile containing only your name, neighborhood, photo and activity stats. They will not see your street name, street address, or any of the other profile details you have shared with your neighborhood. \n\nCan I see posts ONLY from my neighborhood? \nYes. Click your neighborhood name in the left column of the Home Page to only view posts from your neighborhood. We will be releasing an update to the website at the end of next week to make this selection persistent. \n\nSince posting to nearby neighborhoods reaches many more neighbors, it is important to be respectful and stay on-topic. Please avoid commercial or self-promotional messages. Here are some of the best examples of when to post to nearby neighborhoods: \n\n- Sharing information about suspicious activity occurring in several neighborhoods. \n- Finding a lost pet that may have wandered into an adjoining neighborhood. \n- Rallying neighbors from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues. \n\n",

    "snippet" : "Last we heard from Ald. Cullerton, on Everyblock, was that Christopher Belsan 's Skokie court date for his next trial is Feb 14th.   I reached out to Alderman Tim and asked him about the trial. I think he and the rest of the Alderman, this week, are busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking contest, so I'm posting this reply I got:\n\nBelsan is due in court on Thursday at 10 am in the same courtroom in Skokie (107 I think...Judge Haberkorn).\n\nI spoke with the ASA about a week or so ago and as far as I know, he will be offered a three year sentence on a felony gun charge with the possibility of parole is he successfully completes a 120 IDOC Boot Camp ( not the Cook County Boot Camp). I also requested that the Court order him to stay away 100 yards from Portage Park while on parole. If he fails to successfully complete the boot camp or otherwise violates his parole in any way, he will be incarcerated for the full 3 year sentence. The felony charge will be with him forever.\n\nNone of this is Gospel until the Judge formally sentences him if accepts the deal (which I strongly believe he will...... if he has any sense at all).\n\nThis is a far better deal than the usual offer to plead to a lesser, non- felony charge with probation, and I know for a fact that the community's presence at each of the hearings was a major factor in arriving at this offer.  Alderman Cullerton devoted a portion of his opening statement to this issue last Wednesday at the Community meeting and shared this information at that time as well. Well, you could have posted it here! The professionals at DNAinfo failed to report it as well. I did post a lot of other information from it though. Before they did...   I think Heather is staying away from it until she can get facts. Lawyers aren't going to talk until after the kid works his dealio out. You two are on a first-name basis, huh? I think Heather is staying away from it until she can get facts. Lawyers aren't going to talk until after the kid works his dealio out. Well, you could have posted it here! Incidently, the Alderman also detailed possible sentencing soon after the last court date on Everyblock in the big \"Court Date for Portage Park Shooter\" thread......  OK, link to that for us.  Better late than never. I have noticed that a lot of neighborhood meetings are at 6 or 6:30 on weeknights, which is challenging for those who work later than 5 and/or commute downtown.   The trial tomorrow is at 10am. Will you be there? Nope,  and it's Thursday.",

When you don't treat your customers with respect, you deserve what you get.      Agree with the idea of an apprectiation event.  And will put some bucks in.  You know perfectly well they have been community builders and gave creative thought and time well in excess of the paid time.  They have earned the thanks of every single person who has even just scanned the EB salad bar.  Those who have posted and/or commented owe more.  Will watch here for trending rate.  Also my understanding is that there was no monitoring unless someone flagged it. Not true. It was combination of both. ",

An unidentified man approached the woman, removed her clothing and attempted to sexually assault her.\n\nThe attacker is described as a Hispanic man with brown hair and brown eyes, about 40 years old, roughly 5-foot-6 and 130 pounds. Police believe he was driving a black Chevrolet Tahoe or Trailblazer with white “sport” lights.\n\nAnyone with information is strongly urged to call police detectives at 312-744-8261.\n\nAnd please, anyone in the area, please remain aware of your surroundings at all times, and call 911 immediately if you see anything suspicious.\n\nOffice Closed Tuesday\nMy office will be closed Tuesday, Feb. 12, in honor of Lincoln's Birthday. There will be no Ward Night. \n\nWe will reopen at 8 am Wednesday, Feb. 13, and Ward Night will resume on Tuesday, Feb. 19.\n\nAdditionally, the office will be closed Monday, Feb. 18, for Washington's Birthday. \n\nCAPS Community Meeting Recap\nI want to thank the 200 residents who attended the CAPS Community Meeting Wednesday to discuss the shootings last week around Portage Park. Although these shootings were outside the ward, I know criminals do not honor ward boundaries, and these incidents were a concern to all of us. \n\nI also want to thank 16th District Cmd. James O'Donnell and 38th Ward Ald. Tim Cullerton for putting this meeting together so quickly. You can find a recap of the meeting here.\n\nAccording to police statistics, crime is down nine percent in the heart of Portage Park this year, compared to last year. Arrests are up 130 percent, and police contacts with people are up 49 percent. \n\nIn response to the shootings, four or five more squad cars have been assigned to the 16th District, according to police. But police can't do it alone. Most of all, police need us to remain vigilant. If you see something suspicious, call 911.\n",

It has helped, since I actually do feel like I'm decompressing.   Hi Glad.  I was weaning myself off of EB for the past month, so my withdrawl symptoms are relatively mild.    Like most, I used EB to keep in touch with events in the neighborhood.  I enjoyed helping restore the parklet, assisting the wheelchair man with supplies, and having a few meals with Patty's Diner's Club.  Had a few spirited debates with users but generally backed away from the keyboard when things got too heated.  We'll see if we can replace the EB community on reddit or another blog.  Yes --- I said it -- a blog.  Because I chuckled when the final EB post used that term to describe EB.  Take that, Kenji :) Hey there TLO,\nAs you can see, with all my posting here it appears as if I have a case of the delerium tremens.  It has helped, since I actually do feel like I'm decompressing.   I sent a response to this earlier - did it just get sent to Glad's in-box? Or are comments reviewed by a moderator before being posted?  I'm clueless about reddit.\n  I had a love/hate relationship with EB. On one hand, I thought it was a great one-stop resource for keeping up-to-date with happenings in the neighborhood. OTH, I would tire of the endless stream Gladys Kravitz types and sky is falling old cranks talking in code about all the \"changes\" coming to the neighborhood. I always appreciated how Kenji (and others) would sort of needle those folks to keep them honest. Then, there was the \"New\" Democrats and all their trolls that would pop up like that Whack-A-Mole game any time there was an election in the 45th. The \"What Used to be Here\" thread was one of my all time favorites. I loved reading the stories by long time Jeff Parkers. It saddens me that that thread is gone for good. That thread, along with the Save The Portage efforts were perfect examples of how EB could bring folks together in good ways.  The great thing about EB was their ability to aggregate relevant area news stories, and especially city data such as area building permits, inspections and reported crimes. A \"one stop shop\" in other words where I could dig deeper or gloss over depending it's importance to me. The Community Calendar was also very useful.  Agree on those features.  I liked those as well.  Would you mind sharing who you were on EB?  If not that's okay.   Bill the Engineer. I agreed with virtually everything you posted.   Anyone else want to talk?  I'm being told what and how to post. Don't get all bent outta shape. You want us to get a feel for your moderation, yes?  None of us should hold back, no? Not sure what you mean? Most likely the only things that will need to be moderated are racist comments as we go along. You've read the sidebar, right? Yes, the sidebar is almost straight out of the /r/Chicago sidebar.  You mod this subReddit, so we're, me at least, getting a feel for you.  So when a mod tells me to stop b*tching and it has nothing to do with race, then we're getting an opportunity to see how your mind works.  Lay of your land, so to speak.  (I'm a product of primary, secondary and beyond Catholic Ed.) I think you are confusing moderator xrawv, and just plain xrawv. If you posted a racist comment, being there's zero tolerance, your post would just disappear and there might not be a comment made by moderator xrawv about it. If plain old xrawv is telling you to stop whining or bitching he's teling you what he thinks or feels, that's not moderation.\n\nI'm the product of a public school education, but I have two Shamrock sons. Mod-Xrawv sounds like Mothra &amp; Gamera's frat bro.  \nPlain-Xrawv sounds like something I could order at Jamba Juice.\n\n So anyone can start a subreddit and delete/not approve messages from posters they don't like? So anyone can start a subreddit and delete/not approve messages from posters they don't like? MOD-xrawv, care to answer MrMckracken's question?\n\nMrMckrack, who were you on EB?  If you don't want to say, that's fine. Not sure what you mean? Most likely the only things that will need to be moderated are racist comments as we go along. You've read the sidebar, right? Thing is, I don't recall any of those types of examples listed at the right being used on EB. It was pretty civil there.\n\nAnd does that apply to bigotry, intolerance, discrimination, prejudice, xenophobia or bias of any sort against ANY heritage? Thats because the mods on EB deleted the posts really quick. They didn't come close to those examples. I beg to differ. I personally called in dozens of racist remarks that were deleted or the users themselves were deleted. Yup, there were a few that bagged on folks of European heritage, and they were sacked. Anyone else want to talk?  I'm being told what and how to post. Whatchoo wanna talk about? Hey there.  Mind saying who you were on EB, or do you want a fresh start?  Also, would your Dad ever say that his daughters had great legs?   I hear Kenji's sons have nice pecs. That's something Ruthie would say. Hey there.  Mind saying who you were on EB, or do you want a fresh start?  Also, would your Dad ever say that his daughters had great legs?   Whatchoo wanna talk about? Fresh start's good.  EB cracked me up.  We all hoped our posts were more cupcake than rum fruitcake. \n\nEdit:  See, I didn't do that \"child\" thing.  I'm calling it chile (posting as a reply) from now on.  Prolly bad reddiquette.  Cupcakes are those who weren't native to the City, went to a Big 10 school and migrated here for work, not knowing what urban living is all about. They all move to Lake View and North Center because they can't afford Lincoln Park and think that they're living \"da life\". There's a few of them in r/Chicago, but it's easy to ignore them there by not reading the posts.\n\nI didn't do the chitlin thing either, but word morph all you like. \n\nAs far as Reddiquette goes, meh.

Also, I keep reading that there were no ads on EB, but everyday there to the end, I was staring at a little monkey's face from the Phillippines.  What was that?  They had ads. Did anyone think EB was ever going to make money for MSNBC or NBC? If NBC bought EB to get a leg up on other news orgs because EB was being heralded as the cutting edge techy (read cheap:  less journalists because users like us were creating content) direction for them, then I'm sure they didn't like for profit orgs like DNAinfo posting their headlines leading EB people away to their own monetized site.  DNAinfo creates their own content, I thought? Yes they do, but if you were NBC and you paid $1+ million dollars for it (I don't know the real sum), how would you feel about a newcomer like DNAinfo stealing peeps out of your own 10-staffed hyper-local investment? how did DNAinfo \"steal\" anything? You posted DNAinfo headlines with links taking EB users to DNA's site.  DNAinfo also posted their headlines on EB providing links.  DNA used a competitior's (MSNBC) site to draw their users to their own site.  If they \"stole\" anything it was \"site visits\" by EB peeps.  From my very limited knowledge of website analytics, website visits are what are used to determine web ad revenue on a site.  Analogy would be hard copy magazines and the stated circulation on front cover.  The mag's circulation determines the cost of an ad. EB's \"revenue\" was NBC money deposited into EB accounts to pay their salaries and pay their EB bills to stay up and running, there in Ravenswood.  \n\nAdd advertising dollars EB generated themselves on their website, as revenue too.\n\nThe advertising dollars weren't enough revenue to cover the 10 employees, plus the Ravenswood building's expenses.  I'm really missing the random posts by neighborhood folks.  I know I can get news from news outlets, but I'm missing the \"blotter\" type news like, \"Someone Rifled through my Garage,\" or other stuff like, \"What's up with that cranky bike shop?\"  I guess this is the \"hyper-local\" content for which EB was designed. Anyone else miss Chicago Girl's scanner reports? she's a good person I'll miss her. Agree.  Typical, warm-hearted, funny NWSider. ",

Once you are comfortable go and create your PPHH subreddit.\n\nThere's all kinds of interesting features.

    "snippet" : "Dear Kenji, \n\nMy office will be closed Monday, Feb. 18, in honor of Washington's Birthday. We will reopen at 8 am Tuesday, Feb. 19. \nCity Council Update\nI want to give you a quick update on a couple of items from this week's city council meeting. \n\nFirst, the city council unanimously passed additional ethics reforms. The reforms further define and strengthen the roles of the Inspector General, Legislative Inspector General, and Board of Ethics. The ordinance also prohibits lobbying by former aldermen for a year after they leave office. \n\nI voted for the ordinance, but I believe it should have gone further. The ordinance originally proposed by the administration included provisions to allow anonymous ethics complaints against aldermen. Such complaints are already allowed against city employees. \n\nDespite the fact that the anonymous provisions were stricken from the ordinance, it is an improvement. I will continue to support any changes that help strengthen ethics and restore trust in city government. \n\nAt the same city council meeting, I introduced a resolution calling for hearings into the site selection process for red light cameras. 23 other aldermen signed onto the resolution. \n\nThe original intent of the cameras was to improve traffic safety, and I support that goal. However, recent allegations of unethical behavior by the program vendor make me concerned that camera sites were selected based on how much revenue they would generate, not how much safer that would make our roads. \n\nThe resolution asks that Chicago Department of Transportation officials be prepared to discuss how sites are selected, who takes part in making those decisions, and what data is examined. \n\nHopefully, we'll get some answer so that we can ensure that this tool makes our roads safer and isn't used simply to generate revenue. \n\nThanks\nI want to thank the students from Schurz High School who took time out of their day off school Tuesday to show almost 200 seniors a good time during my Senior Valentine's Dance. It was great to see so many young people mixing and mingling with our seniors. \n\nI also want to thank Heck's Catering on Milwaukee Avenue for donating their fantastic food. A great time was had by all. We've already started planning for next year.   The City is Hiring\nThe city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications is hiring traffic control aides to help during the upcoming, multi-year expansion of the CTA Red Line south. \n\nThese are part-time positions that start at $18.43 an hour. Applicants must be 19 years old when they apply. Applications will be accepted through Feb. 18 at the city's Human Resources website. \n Free Tax Filing Assistance \nThe Ladder Up Financial Liberation program is partnering with area colleges to help provide tax preparation services for free to individuals who earned less than $20,000 or families who earned less than $45,000 last year. \n\nThe assistance is available at 13 sites in Chicago, including in Northeastern Illinois University Student Union, 5500 N. St. Louis, and Wright College, 4300 N. Narragansett. Each site is open from 8:30 am to 11:30 am every Saturday through April 13. \n\nAdditionally, NEIU is open from 5:30-8:30 pm on Mondays in February, and the Wright College site is also open 3:30-8:30 pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays. \n\nMake sure to bring an original Social Security or ITIN card for everyone on the return, a photo i.d., all 2012 tax documents, and your 2011 tax return.\n \n\nFor a full list of sites or more information, visit the Ladder Up website or call (312) 409-1555.\n\nFor assistance with the application, visit the Human Resources Department at City Hall, 121 N. LaSalle, in Room 100, or call (312) 744-4976, between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm Monday through Friday.\n\nFree FAFSA Help\nApplying for federal financial aid for college can be a complicated process. But City Clerk Susanna Mendoza and the Ladder Up Financial Liberation program are working to make it easier.\n\nMendoza and Ladder Up are offering free help for families navigating the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Help is available every Tuesday from Feb. 5 to April 9, from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm at City Hall, 121 N. LaSalle, Room 107.\n\nTo complete the application, the student and his or her parents or spouse must provide the following: Social Security numbers; birthdates; alien registration/permanent resident cards, if the student is not a citizen; completed 2012 tax returns and any earning statements for the student, parents, and spouse, if applicable; information on untaxed income; checking and savings balances; other asset information; and a list of colleges to which the student is applying. \n\nFor more information, call (312) 458-9105 or email Ladder Up.\n\nThanks for reading\n ",
