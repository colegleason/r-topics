    "title" : "Dr's who are idiots rant...",
    "snippet" : "Took my 15 year old to see the Dr last week due to chest pain not being able to breath and dizziness when trying to get up. Waited 3 hours due to being a walk in fine when we get back to be seen Dr asks her symptoms she says whats wrong and how she is feeling and what has been going on with her. While we are sitting there Dr says oh I know exactly whats wrong you are pregnant! My daughters eyes popped out of face because she is not active never had a boyfriend and its not possible unless we say immaculate conception. \n\n\n\nAfter explaining it is not possible Dr says we need a pregnancy test ASAP because it will verify your pregnancy uggh damn Dr said she knew she was pregnant and was just lying to me because She was ashamed that she disappointed me and her father. I told the Dr that she was out of line and I wanted to see the other Dr because if we both meaning daughter and I that pregnancy is not possible then it isn't and move on. She has her take a urine test that proves negative then she has the balls to say oh you aren't pregnant lol next time use protection and we wont have these issues and sends us on our way :( I left a huge complaint and have another appointment next week with the regular Dr to find out what is wrong with her. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I dont get is why the hell didn't the Dr listen to both of us! If you are told pregnancy isn't possible don't ignore the patient and say you know thats what it is because all symptoms prove pregnancy! My poor daughter was in tears over this and had a an anietxy attack at the thought of having to go through a pap smear and female exam to prove that she wasn't pregnant!!  Devil's advocate: Patients lie, sometimes tests are required just to be *sure*. How they handled it was rude and unnecessary, but it is understanding that doctors may not trust their patient or the patient's parent.   I'm sorry that they didn't address your daughter's symptoms after the pregnancy test was negative. Did they really not do *anything else?* hey didn't take any blood tests or listen to her chest or anything? \n\nRegarding the doctor not believing you and your daughter about not being pregnant, I'm sorry but young women lie **so often** about these things that doctors are required by medical guidelines to do a pregnancy test if any young woman has any symptoms that might indicate pregnancy. You may have a great relationship with your daughter, but a lot of girls are terrified of their parent finding out they have sex. If a doctor took your/her word for it that she couldn't possibly be pregnant and sent her for an X-ray or something that damaged the baby, they'd lose their licence. Similarly, if they took someone's word for it and they were pregnant and were getting no prenatal care, the doctor would be at fault. \n\nIf a young woman presents with potential pregnancy symptoms, doctor's HAVE to do a pregnancy test. It's not personal. However angry you might be with them, they're looking after young women's health by doing what they do.\n\nI am really sorry if this doctor had poor bedside manner though. They should explain things better and they definitely should have done SOMETHING after having a pregnancy test come back negative. If they really did nothing at all then that's pretty poor healthcare. Your daughter could be anaemic, or have asthma or something and it should be investigated.  I understand what you are saying but when we both told her NOT POSSIBLE, she should have understood what that meant and not insist on it being a pregnancy. We have an appointment next week with another Dr who is going to run a full panel and figure out what is wrong with her. This Dr didn't do anything else except check her for diabetes and then sent us on our way. Since I have Lupus and it runs in the family they will be checking her for that and we do know that she is asthmatic and her Anemia levels are ok since she has to take iron daily for that.

That is criminally insane. Being out of breath and dizzy isn't a symptom of pregnancy. And on top of that, it sounds like when the doctor was wrong about pregnancy he didn't address your child's actual symptoms. Wow. That is criminally insane.

And on top of that, it sounds like when the doctor was wrong about pregnancy he didn't address your child's actual symptoms. This Dr is new to the clinic never seen her before and won't be seeing her ever again after this incident. I went on the rampage the indian and mexican came out that day something they never thought they would see lol The head of the office who took my complaint said I would never of thought you could be so mean lol I told her when it comes to my kids the sweet lil mexican mama turns into the big bad mexican mama!! Oh, there is the catch! I bet $20 she assumed she was pregnant because you are Mex/Indian. \n\nEDIT: Call your state's board and file a complaint. This is a prime example of discrimination in medicine. The Dr didn't even address the symptoms after pregnancy test was negative and assumed your daughter was having unprotected sex. Stereotyping.   I might kindly suggest that a little editing would go a long way in improving the readability of this post. I might kindly suggest you read heartfelt posts for their content rather to critique the way it's written. I usually do.  To be perfectly honest, I got so distracted by the run-on sentences and such that I had a hard time concentrating on the content.  The OP has since made a few edits, such as paragraph breaks, which make it much easier to comprehend.  Downvote away if you like, but those small changes made  big difference and I hope will help in getting the OP the feedback she desires.  ",

    "title" : "Most women misunderstand IUD birth control",
    "snippet" : "  &gt;One recent survey of physicians found that 30 percent had outdated ideas about IUDs, including thinking they are unsafe for women who had never had a baby or being unsure about their safety (see Reuters Health story of March 28, 2012 here: http://reut.rs/HhJ0dH).\n\nThat's for sure. Nothing like a gynecologist telling you that the IUD you have is going to cause more disease and that I should be on the pill instead. If physicians aren't informed and aren't suggesting them as a form of birth control, then patients won't be as likely to ask or have it.  exactly. I've had doctors and gynos tell me before that I can't get an IUD because I've never been pregnant (however, my current doctor says I can get it) and then they rattle off a list of side effects, but don't go into detail about the side effects of the pill. I've had some *brutal* side effects from birth control pills that weren't talked about until after they started occurring. Nothing extremely serious like a stroke or blood clot, but the fact that so many doctors refuse to acknowledge IUDs and act like the pill is the only available option is ridiculous.  I've had a very similar experience. It wasn't until I did some research and had to go to Planned Parenthood, who basically told me I should be on an IUD or one hormone birth control because of the migraines I'd been experiencing. Funny how my migraines drastically decreased after my IUD was inserted.  That's *exactly* what happened to me. When I found out that my BC pills were what was aggravating my migraines (they were to the point where I'd be in bed for days on end, vomiting non stop, etc), I was so confused. I had no idea combination BC pills could have side effects related to migraines and no one (well, in the media or majority of physicians at least) discusses the benefits of IUDs or progesterone only BC.  \n  \n For the record, migraine with aura is an absolute contraindication to the combined contraceptive pill. If you had that and your doctor prescribed you the pill they're an idiot and negligent. For the record, migraine with aura is an absolute contraindication to the combined contraceptive pill.

And it's not like my gyno didn't know about my migraines. He even prescribed Imitrex, which made me feel so sick it wasn't even worth any benefit. \n\nFunny how we had the same experience! ugh, same. I'm on a few migraine meds (one I take daily as a preventative thing and as needed) and all of my medications were in my file, so it's not like it wasn't obvious. I know, that's so weird! I'm glad you had good results with the IUD! I'm currently on the minipill (micronor) right now which was an attempt to help the migraine issue but it's fucking with my endo so I waiting for a consultation to get the Mirena. Hopefully I'll get results with that.   I don't think this is giving women enough credit. Maybe people don't look into it or consider it as an option because of the associated risks and the pain of insertion. \n\nThere are serious complications, *when there are complications*, for both forms of birth control. I think people stick with the pill because they know more people personally who have had positive results. That said, I definitely think the IUD is gaining in popularity.   I looked into getting an IUD when I was considering my bc options, but all the horror stories turned me off. And I'm not talking internet reviews, these are from my personal friends. Bleeding for several months after the procedure, loving it for 5 years until they go to get it removed and find that it's been lodged into the cervix and has to be surgically removed, and the worst of all - my sister-in-law was having stomach pains about 3 years after getting hers. She goes into the dr's office and they do an ultrasound and see that hers has broken through her cervix and is floating around her abdominal cavity. That shit is terrifying. I love the *idea* of an IUD, but I (personally) think they're too new and not safe enough yet. But maybe I'm just paranoid!! I would still take any of those outcomes over having a stroke or the horrible migraines I used to get twice a month when I was on the pill.  Yes, those are bad too - but the IUD and the pill are not your only options. Nuvaring, the patch, and the depo shot all have really bad side effects and increase your risk of stroke. Also, they are all less effective than an IUD. \n\nSure, it's not my only option but I feel I would be really stupid not to choose it, since comparatively the risks are so much less severe.  ",

    "title" : "[trigger warning] need advice on how to talk to my SO about what happened this morning...",
    "snippet" : "I've (26F) been with my SO (28M) since the beginning of January, so still a very new relationship. It's hands down the healthiest relationship that I've been in. \n\nI've had PTSD since early 2009ish, I was raped in September 2008 and 2009. I've been in and out of therapy for other reasons as well, but there was never enough time spent on thoroughly discussing being raped and how to cope with it.\n\nI had planned on telling my SO about what happened a long time from now. In the past I've had the tendency to bring up too much, too quickly. Unfortunately because of what happened this morning, he knows. No details yet, and unless he asks I probably won't tell him for a while.\n\nSo last night we were watching Game of Thrones, and we watched the episode in which a character almost gets raped by a few guys. So far I've been okay with any of the sex scenes in the show, even turned on by them. I guess for some reason that scene triggered me, but it wouldn't affect me until a few hours later.\n\nHe fell asleep on the couch so I went to the bedroom instead. I woke up to him holding onto me and asking me if I was ok. Apparently I had a panic attack in my sleep that woke me up. I couldn't remember what I was dreaming about, but I thought it must have been due to the show.\n\nEventually I fell back asleep. His alarm for work went off, but we snoozed it and kept spooning. He was caressing me on my thighs and my breasts, and went down on me. We were getting ready to have sex when I told him to stop. Nothing actually happened, but I felt off and knew it wasn't a good idea to continue. \n\nHe asked if I was ok and I said no. We laid down and I snuggled into his chest and started to cry. I told him that I was upset and that I didn't want to have to tell him this so soon but what happened was so unexpected. So I don't him that I was raped. Just that phrase, no dates, how many times, no details. I knew he was already late for work so I didn't want to get into everything then. He held me until I fell asleep and left for work. \n\nOf course, it would have been best for me if he had stayed home from work in bed with me for a while and we got to talk about everything and had a low-key day, but I know that that's not realistic. I've been thinking about the conversation that we'll need to have in a few hours when he gets back from work, but I'd like to hear advice from you ladies.\n\nmy thoughts/concerns:\n\n1. if he asks for details, I have no problem telling him.\n\n2. we tend to lean more towards the more kinky side of sex, nothing too crazy, but not very vanilla. I'm afraid (and will tell him this) that now that he knows this it will affect sex in a negative way. I guess as an example...he may feel uncomfortable holding me down or being rough with me, even though I am ok with it. \n\n3. I don't want to fall into the \"emotionally unstable\" label. I've fought really fucking hard for years to overcome shit that's happened to me, and I'm proud of how far I've come. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder a few years ago, and went through Dialectical Behavior Therapy. DBT changed my life, and had a major impact on how I handle my relationships. \n\nI do realize that what happened today will have an impact on the relationship, I just want to make sure I'm communicating and handling it the best way I can. \n\nthanks in advance for advice, I am grateful that I have 2XC to turn to, since I don't have any friends to talk to about this.\n\n**tl;dr: new relationship, had a flashback while with SO, told him I've been raped, want to make sure we have a proper conversation about it and move on.**\n  I don't have anything very helpful to add.  You already sound like you've thought about this a lot.  I am sorry you went through what you did.  Congratulations for the progress you have made also!  I just wanted to send good vibes your way I guess.  &lt;3  I have C-PTSD, so can definitely understand. It seems to me like you have this pretty much under control, so I'll just add a little tidbit that I've found works for me. When talking to my partner about it, it's really helpful to have another source there (eg. webpage, book, etc.) so I can point specific things out and walk us both through explanations of flashbacks and such. It's also nice to remind myself 'this is a symptom, not just me being nuts'. \n\nGood luck.  Oh! Thanks for the tip! the one thing that I am kind of \"looking forward\" to explaining is my exaggerated startle response. That's one symptom that I've never been able to shake and I get teased about it constantly by people that don't know what it's from. \n\nJust yesterday I had to tell him that there was a reason for my startle, but now I can tell him why and he'll finally understand why I jump at the smallest things.

Wow. I put a lot of effort into not letting my rape affect me, I had no idea that being super jumpy could be related. That explains a lot haha.\n\nI'm glad you told him sooner rather than later. I finally told my current boyfriend after he'd triggered me during sex, and by that point he felt really guilty for triggering in the first place and it's something we're still kinda trying to move past. Honestly, I had no intention of ever telling anyone and I'd never tried telling anyone so I had no idea how I was supposed to broach the subject, but it sounds like you're prepared and have thought this through. I'm hoping the best for you!! Me too.  This is crazy, I'm tearing as I read this. All of this, me too.  You are not alone. I got the shakes at that scene, and horrific nightmares. \n\nI've read that in many cases of sexual assult and rape that people develop a taste for non vanilla sex, maybe because it feels more genuine. I know I personally did, and despite knowing I can't help that it turns me on to mimic losing my control with my SO (being held down, taking it, the unique difference is being made to feel good not just being...well, a hole)\n\nIt's hard to tell the SO. I wish I could hug you all. To feel alone and find a place where no, I'm not alone,  WE are not alone in this. But until your SO knows, you can't move forward. \n\nIt will be okay. I can't promise but I hope so. It took my time to tell my SO and I've had a few SOs who couldn't deal with it and made things worse, but until you share that part of you and give them a chance to understand, they will only feel that you don't trust them and are not giving them a chance. Don't let that act from your past take from you any more\n\n(Currently with someone who doesn't have the answers but is happy to hold me while I do. That's all I ask and I'm grateful every day.) I'm also a rape survivor who enjoys non vanilla sex. I had no idea that the two are connected. I actually always assumed it was weird for me to enjoy rough sex and things like being held down and controlled given what happened to me. Now that I know this, it kind of makes me angry that my sexual taste has been shaped by what that scumbag did to me.\n\nIt's been nearly 7 years and I've made so much progress in being normal again that sex with my current boyfriend of over a year has never once triggered me. I've also not told him. I want to, but I've never told anyone IRL besides the therapist I was seeing right afterwards. I really want him to understand why I sometimes I have trouble reading or watching things like Game of Thrones (even though I love them), but I'm afraid he might see me as damaged and feel the need to walk on eggshells around me, especially when it comes to sex. I definitely don't want this. I'm also a rape survivor who enjoys non vanilla sex. I had no idea that the two are connected. I actually always assumed it was weird for me to enjoy rough sex and things like being held down and controlled given what happened to me. Now that I know this, it kind of makes me angry that my sexual taste has been shaped by what that scumbag did to me.\n\nIt's been nearly 7 years and I've made so much progress in being normal again that sex with my current boyfriend of over a year has never once triggered me.

I definitely don't want this. Me too.  This is crazy, I'm tearing as I read this. All of this, me too.  You are not alone. I got the shakes at that scene, and horrific nightmares. \n\nI've read that in many cases of sexual assult and rape that people develop a taste for non vanilla sex, maybe because it feels more genuine. I know I personally did, and despite knowing I can't help that it turns me on to mimic losing my control with my SO (being held down, taking it, the unique difference is being made to feel good not just being...well, a hole)\n\nIt's hard to tell the SO. I wish I could hug you all. To feel alone and find a place where no, I'm not alone,  WE are not alone in this. But until your SO knows, you can't move forward. \n\nIt will be okay. I can't promise but I hope so. It took my time to tell my SO and I've had a few SOs who couldn't deal with it and made things worse, but until you share that part of you and give them a chance to understand, they will only feel that you don't trust them and are not giving them a chance. Don't let that act from your past take from you any more\n\n(Currently with someone who doesn't have the answers but is happy to hold me while I do. That's all I ask and I'm grateful every day.) Oh! Thanks for the tip! the one thing that I am kind of \"looking forward\" to explaining is my exaggerated startle response. That's one symptom that I've never been able to shake and I get teased about it constantly by people that don't know what it's from. \n\nJust yesterday I had to tell him that there was a reason for my startle, but now I can tell him why and he'll finally understand why I jump at the smallest things.

    "title" : "Can we talk about anger?  How do you ladies control yours?  ",
    "snippet" : "As the title suggests, I'd love to hear how you lovelies deal with anger. Yesterday I found myself in a situation where I think I had every right to be angry, but not so much every right to scream at someone.  The thing is, my anger just felt so BIG, and I definitely screamed when I shouldn't have.  So now, I'm trying to figure out what I could have done differently, and I wanted to hear what *you* do in situations like this.  \n\nThanks y'all &lt;3\n  When I feel like I have a very short fuse I immediately remove myself from the situation.  The more emotion I am feeling, the less I am able to handle rational thoughts or be objective - I feel consumed.  If it is an argument, I find it's best to say that you wish to discuss it when you have calmed down.\n\nEven just walking around alone helps calm me down.  Once no longer worked up it's easier to have a productive conversation about what happened and easier to understand the other person's side of the story.\n\nIf I just feel worked up in general, over a longer period of time I make sure I exercise... a lot.  That almost always does the trick. Yep, I have a terrible temper that I got from my father that was a problem when I was a kid, but over the years I have trained myself to just remove myself from the situation when I feel like I'm going to have an outburst. I find curling up in bed with a hot water bottle extremely soothing, but I think everyone is different in what they find calming. Then later on I can talk it out or do whatever I need to do to let it go.  How long does it usually take you to get calm?  What do you do when you can't get away?   When I feel like I have a very short fuse I immediately remove myself from the situation.  The more emotion I am feeling, the less I am able to handle rational thoughts or be objective - I feel consumed.

That almost always does the trick.  I go to my dresser or my book shelf or desk and with my two hands I throw everything off of it in one big sweeping motion. Like how people do in movies when they're about to have serious sex in an inappropriate location. Except I'm just going have sex with how pissed off I am.\n\nThen I topple over whichever piece of furniture it was. I do this maybe once or twice a month when I can't take anything anymore. This might be bad advice.    I store up all the rage from my day, and then lift weights as a release. I don't know how, but it works for me.   I work with kids (nanny/soon to be teacher) and there are times when they get to you. I have been brought to the brink of fury at times. The most important thing for me is to take a moment, and reflect. What is it that is making me so angry? What can I do to calm myself? What do I need to do to diffuse the situation? and if all else fails, walk away from the problem. Losing your lid over something is sometimes worse than admitting defeat. Obviously, when working with kids i cant just up and leave, but I will switch tracks, find something else for them to do, something that will give myself a moment to think. \n\nIt's hard, especially at those times when you are boiling with anger. But those are the times you are most likely to make the biggest mistakes. I know it sounds cliche, but take ten really deep breaths. Count them. The counting and the extra oxygen will help you clear your head and decide what the best course of action is.   I think I might just be a rather sensitive person, but honestly, most of the time when I'm angry, it really just means that I'm hurt. My next step is to just own it, and let myself feel that hurt. Other comments in here talk about empathy, and I do that, too. I try to figure out why the other person would do something so hurtful to me? There is usually a reason, from their point of view, that might explain their actions.\nHowever, some reasons are better than others, and just because you understand why someone did something doesn't make it right. There are plenty of reasons to be justifiably angry at someone, because humans can be selfish and thoughtless about others. There are plenty of people in my life who have wronged me, and I understand why. I try and forgive those people, but I know not to trust them with certain things in the future. \nBut yeah - basically take a step back, try to understand the situation and handle yourself with as much grace as possible. Sometimes that's all you can do.  I have a terrible temper when I'm stressed. Screaming when it's too much (even if it's into a pillow) helps. Other times I just talk myself out of it- rationalize what's making you angry. Look for the other side of things, think about how the other person is feeling. Sometimes I even just imagine that they're going through something really, really heavy and it makes it easier to cut them some slack and come down from the situation. Anger is an emotion that, at least for me, only makes me feel shittier. Trying to empathize with the other person helps me cool down *a lot.* \n\nAlternatively, you could smoke weed about it. lol    When I'm super pissed to the point I just want to punch something, I go to the gym and use the weight machines! Its a great way to push your body and get that physical and emotional aggression out in a positive way!  i remove myself from the situation and try to rationalize things.\nif that doesn't work, i go home and sex up the boyfriend.\nif _that_ doesn't work, i go to the range.  shooting always requires me to focus on what i'm doing rather than what's bothering me, so it gives me a break.  when i finish up at the range, i find i'm better able to process my emotions. What do you do when you're mad at the boyfriend?\n\nI don't shoot (yet...I'd like to learn), but I can see the value in doing something that requires focus.  I will try to get my mind off whatever is making me mad, but unless I'm using a distraction that takes all of my attention, it really doesn't work. call your friends. hopefully you have some really close ones that will take your anger and turn it into something all of you can laugh about. otherwise, try writing everything down. even if you end up destroying the paper, i find that literally \"getting it out\" and down onto paper really helps.  What do you do when you're mad at the boyfriend?\n\nI don't shoot (yet...I'd like to learn), but I can see the value in doing something that requires focus.  I will try to get my mind off whatever is making me mad, but unless I'm using a distraction that takes all of my attention, it really doesn't work. if i'm mad at him, i cut out the sex bit and go straight to the range.  doesn't happen all that often, though.\n\nare you anywhere near Baltimore?  i make a habit of taking new women to the range.  if you aren't, find a range local to you, ask them if they have newbie classes or educate new people on proper gun handling and basics, and to learn to shoot.  rent a .22 pistol and go to town.  it's fun!  and it's one of those things where you absolutely must focus if you want to be _good_ at it. I actually used to live in Laurel, but I moved away a couple of years ago!  It's a shame, since it would be a lot of fun to have another lady (especially an awesome lady redditor) to go with.  I will have to ask around among the folks I know to see if anyone is up for it :) aww, dang!\n\ndefinitely ask around, see if anyone wants to go...but learn the basics from someone who will put you behind a .22.  if someone says \"well i have this little revolver...\" don't do it.  not your first time out, anyway.   Thanks for the tip :)  Clench my fists, take deep breaths and avoid people for the duration of the anger. Once I've calmed down, I go back to the situation and deal with it rationally. \n\nThat is, when I don't scream and cry from frustration of course... But my method works most of the time!  Yeah, once I've cooled off, I can deal with the situation like an adult.  I just wish I could cool off more quickly!       i definitely know the feeling.\nhowever, like you, i'm not so great at handling it. \nall i can say is it helps me to get out. go to the bathroom (its a good excuse) and do all your cursing and yelling and kicking and hitting quietly. if you tear up a bit, you can wash your face and pretend you're washing your hands. \ni feel like this alot when i'm on my period. dont know if its the same for you, but if it is...just know you're not the only one who flips out at little things for no good reason.\nbasically, remember that THEY pissed you off, and no matter what the world thinks, you have a right to be mad at them. even if you're the only one who agrees with you, it doesn't mean you're wrong. don't turn your anger in on yourself. it just leads to more problems. trust me. \ngood luck :)       Me and rage are old friends.  I work in the veterinary field, where a big part of this job is controlling one's emotions, and not always in the ways you might think.  A lot of owners are stupid, ignorant, rude or otherwise abrasive, but what gets to you are the long hours and the combative animals.  \n\nI have to maintain my empathy and perspective, even when I'm sitting Steve Irwin-style on a screaming, biting, 120lb intact male german shepherd that is trying to kill us for trimming his nails.  It is not the dog's fault he's a stupid turkey.  We are there to help him and help his people...not to bash his big, stupid head on the floor.  Sometimes, this state of mind is much, much harder to maintain than one might think.  \n\nSometimes, I just get up and walk out of the room.  I'd rather waste an effort, look like an ass, and prolong a procedure than lose my shit at a patient.  I walk around outside, go eat something delicious, enjoy a pilfered smoke break, whatever.  Doodle on reddit for five minutes, maybe.  Whatever it takes to shake me out of \"red mist\" level frustration.  Takehome suggestion: When about to blow your stack, GTFO. :-)   I pretty much have really bad rage issues, I really don't remeber a day when I didn't feel angry. It's just like a part of me and something that I have had help to control, so it's all under control now using these few things.\n\nSomestimes some don't work, sometimes I use a different way. Normally one will work. \n\n1. I do yoga and when I am at my calmest I think about how I feel and then when I am angry I try and remeber how I felt. If I am dealing face to face and can't leave this helps tons. You can do it with any situation if you take the time to remeber everything, like the sun on your face, the smell of the outdoors, how relaxed you felt and how happy. Going to a momment that you have pre-memorised is fantastic most the time.\n\n2. If I am able to remove myself I do (leave the room, stop the conversation as politly as I can and get back to it when the anger has cooled off.) Thinking about the situation lots will help my mind think of it as something 'old' and then when I deal with it I am less angry because the main front of my anger has worn off. \n\n3. If it's something someone is saying I try and change the topic to something I like and that I know will cheer me up and allow me to use that anger as excitement instead. \n\n4. Also if I can't leave sometimes I just think about killing that person and then about how awful I would feel after, and how anger isn't worth it. Also mind killing them blows off a little of the steam :p\n\n5. If it's something I am dealing with online that I have to reply to, I make myself a tea and allow it to cool before I write back. It normally cools me off enough to think clearly. \n\n6. If it fits the situation, I will think about the other persons veiw and why they would think it's okay to act like that.\n\n7. Exercise, I work out about an hour a day and it takes the edge off. \n\n8. Hot baths, it feels like it burns off the anger. \n\nthere we go, that is what I can think of atm, I hope that helps :)  This is a fabulous comprehensive list.  I especially like #1 and #4, which I guess is kind of funny since they're a little bit opposite to each other.  I can be kind of extreme in my anger, but I want to behave in a way that is better than my rage, but I'm not so good at calming myself down as quickly as some folks.  Anyway, thank you!  I will definitely be trying some of these.     I have a very short temper, but I tend to burn very very subarctic cold. Very cold. I'm also highly confrontational.\n\nIn most instances I don't usually control it, per se. If I have a problem with what you're saying, I tell you straight away. I have had to learn to go from saying \"I find this offensive\" to \"I feel offended *because* ______\". People get reactively angry if you tell them they're pissing you off, but they seem to be more willing to work with you if you explain. And if they aren't willing to talk it out, then in general I don't feel particularly bad about what comes next -- the Ice Bitch. \n\nI will get cold, condescending and very sharp. I know it's not productive, and I'm aware even when I'm doing it. I've also come to the conclusion that sometime you just can't fix stupid. I will demand to talk to a manager at a store, I will talk to the supervisor if I'm stuck in phone hell, you name it. And I will lay out very clearly why I am thoroughly unimpressed. On the flip, I try to do the same if I am in a situation where someone deserves praise. The only thing walking away does is make me stew and lash out twice as hard at the next person, so for me it's much more efficient and better all around to say my piece and move on.  What do you do when the other person yells back? I generally speak my mind, but the other person usually has something to retort and it escalates into a full-blown argument pretty quickly, I've noticed.",

    "snippet" : "I picked up a cup (Lunette) this month but honestly...I don't really like it.  I've used it five times this month in hopes it was a learning curve situation but I'm still not in love with this thing like half the Internet seems to be.  \n\nIt's tricky to remove, even with the tricks from the YouTube videos, and I have to remove it a lot because I have heavy flow.

There are other brands and I'm sure some of the other women on here will chime in on usage advice and the learning curve.  But at the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with choosing what works best for your body and lifestyle.  (One of the reasons I can't use a cup, for instance, has to do with how the bathrooms are set up where I work.) There is always a loud advocate population for any \"recently popular awesome thing\" among female Redditors (most notably IUDs, weightlifting, and properly fitting bras) There is always a loud advocate population for any \"recently popular awesome thing\" among female Redditors (most notably IUDs, weightlifting, and properly fitting bras) Is this a bad thing?

I won't stop trying though. I hope to find a good doctor who cares about me and not quarterly prescriptions. \n\nI have the fluer cup and gosh, as much as I love the idea it does take getting used to. I'm always struggling to get it out and terrified I'll drop it in the toilet and be in public with no protection.

How old are you? We had great sex Ed where I was. The iud may have been mentioned but not really emphasized in any way. I am 33. Wow, nice. Where are you? IUDs are a \"recently popular awesome thing\"...? Well, when I started college it was \"condoms or the pill.\"  The patch, Nuvaring, IUD didn't get talked about a lot until a few years later, and now with more information available quicker than ever/people being more open about stuff generally, you see more people looking into non condom non pill BC at younger ages. Could be regional, not sure, YMMV That's a good point, and the reason for IUDs not being popular in previous years is due to the massive failure of the first prototype that was offered in the US. I'd say the reason many doctors today frown upon giving them to women is because of the stigma still attached to them. I guess I only asked about the \"recently popular\" part because I've been aware of them for a few years (though only got one recently- woo!) I got one four years ago and nobody I talked to knew what one was. They'd all joke that I had an IED *(eye-roll)*. Now most people I talk to know what an IUD is the instant I say the acronym, and it seems to be much more respected as a birth control option. There is always a loud advocate population for any \"recently popular awesome thing\" among female Redditors (most notably IUDs, weightlifting, and properly fitting bras) these are newly popular things? lol. where have you been?  There is always a loud advocate population for any \"recently popular awesome thing\" among female Redditors (most notably IUDs, weightlifting, and properly fitting bras) Properly fitting bras are like a a cornerstone of living, I hope the \"recently popular\" thing is just down to better training of bra fitters who, before I met a shameless old French woman, were really.. icky about trying to measure me and had been giving me the wrong size for a long time.\n\nI have now got so many properly fitted bras and they're amazing. I used to avoid the underwire like the plague but now I know what it *should* feel like I love them as well :D \n\nFind little old bra fitting ladies with no shame who can tell you your size as soon as you walk in. &lt;3 I would say it sounds like you dislike the fundamental principles of cup usage and are a better candidate for tampons and the like.  Which is OK!  Your vag, your choice.  If you decide you want to try again another time, you have the equipment. Yep.  I like this concept (ecologically friendly, nonabsorbent materials) but the mechanics are inconvenient.  Bummer.   If you want it because of the less waste thing, I'd just go with o.b. tampons. Hardly any waste and they are comfy and easy to use.  I'm wearying a diva cup right now and I'm not completely sold on it. This is my second period using it. I have long and heavy periods because I have paragard. The diva cup works well on light days but on heavy days it leaks a lot. The only solution I have found so far is to wear a thin panty liner to protect my underwear. Every night is gets sucked deep inside my vagina and it is very difficult to get it out.

I never understood how it was possible to keep it like that because it'd migrate up on its own.

If you feel like it, try out another brand. I had luck right away with the Diva Cup. But if it's just too uncomfortable for you, it's really ok to use tampons instead! Those things are really expensive though.  Not as expensive as a box of tampons every month!  At one time, yeah it is. I've never bought tampons that took 40$+ out of my weekly or monthly budget. It would take 9 or 8 months of tampons to pay for that. And if you already shelled that out for one and am just trying another brand... pricey. &gt;At one time, yeah it is. \n\nSo save up $15 each month for two months and there you have it... They are $30 a cup. I don't want to have to save up when I can spend 5 bucks to get my needs met with something I know works. At one time, yeah it is.

Diva Cups are $30. A box of tampons is never less that $5, and up to $10 depending what kind you buy. You'll make up the difference in price in 3-5 months of using the Diva Cup, more or less... and then after that, you don't need to re-buy the cup because it lasts for a year or more. I'm not sure how that is considered expensive in the scheme of things. Depends on the brand, a 20 pack of generic cardboard (ugh) was less than 4 dollars at the Walmart here and big lots would be even cheaper. Gahhhhh I can't do cardboard or applicator-free tampons... My vagina is never happy with them :P   It took me three flows to like my cup. I'm very small/tight and it was quite painful at first. Eventually, i went on some forums and did a few adjustments (made the holes bigger for less suction) and that turned me. I have a super light and short flow, so I don't know how I would feel if my flow was heavier.\n\nThat being said, if you don't like it, you don't like it. It's a personal preference, though I understand it's a bummer to be out of the money more so than anything. I would contact their customer service to see if they can offer you any refund, because that's a hefty price for one flow :/    Liking your menstrual cup isn't mandatory. It might just be that they're not suitable for you personally. No big deal, just sling it out and go back to whatever you were using before.\n\nIt gets easier to remove as you work out the method that suits you best. I have regular flow and only need to change it 3 or 4 times a day. The easiest way for me to remove it is to squat and imagine I'm having a poop (obviously don't do this is you actually need to poop, something untoward might happen). If you're tense or anxious about it, then your vagina is going to subconsciously firm up and it's going to be hard to take out. Relaxation here is key. \n\nI have a size A mooncup, I get on with it really well and I'd never go back to tampons. It was a learning curve for me too and it took me a few cycles to get used to using it. I'm glad I persevered though.\n\n I just wish it hadn't cost $40 to find out I don't really like it.  Cautionary tale.  \n\nI might use it for lighter flow days when I can leave it in all day until I can take it out in the shower.  *shrug*  Sad day!  I really liked my Lunette cup.  I think my only gripe was that it could be really awkward to get in there.  It was a little bulky for me.  I'm lucky in that I don't have a very heavy period, so it worked out well for me.  \n\nNow that I have an IUD, I switched back to tampons.  I'm a little wary of using the cup with it, even though my strings are probably short enough.  I had a rough enough time getting it in there, I do not want to do anything that would make it come out.  I really started to enjoy mine after the second month. By then I was a lot more comfortable with it and how to insert. I don't believe you need to worry about cleaning it in the middle of the night either. TSS is a tampons only sort of thing. \n\nBut like other people have been saying, you have no requirement to like the cup. The only thing that matters is making your period work for you.  The changing it in the middle of the night thing is because it starts to fill up and leaks.  I would be more than happy to leave it alone all night -- that was what I was hoping I could do with one.  Woe!   Darn. You said that your desire to use a cup was eco-based. Have you looked into [moon-pads](http://shop.moonpads.com.au/) at all? It may not be something you want to use all the time, but perhaps lazy days?         I HATE THEM SO MUCH OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so uncomfortable for me I think I developed a slight fever because my body was so unused to it. Sometimes things just don't work out.  I'm no expert, but if you have to get up and change tampons or cups in the middle of the night because your flow's so heavy, there may be a problem. Have you talked to your doctor about this? Yep, there's nothing they can find that explains it.  My mom was the same way.   For years I had a heavy flow until I began to take iron every night during my period. My gyno recommended it because the blood loss made me weak. Have you tried it?  I'm no expert, but if you have to get up and change tampons or cups in the middle of the night because your flow's so heavy, there may be a problem. Have you talked to your doctor about this? A lot of women have a heavy flow that requires getting up and changing tampons/pads whatever. Doesn't mean there is anything wrong with them, just that their flow is different that your own. If you sleep for more than 4hrs, which most people do, you should get up and change your tampon regardless of flow due to the risk of TSS anyway.  ",

    "title" : "Has anyone taken a cheater back?",
    "snippet" : "My BF of a year and some months was cheating on me. It's been 2 weeks since we broke up. I just spoke to him on the phone for 2 hours. Even after all the hurt and pain I've gone through, I still want only him.\nI asked, and he agreed that I love him more than he loves me. It's so painful to hear that I am not enough for him. But he swears up and down that he was never happier than with me - he thinks that the highs were the happiest moments of his life, but the lows were the worst he's ever experienced. And it was during the lows that he strayed.\n\nWhat do you think?  Am I being a silly young girl? He says that he will never cheat again, whether if its on me or on the next girl he dates. He says he has learned his lesson, and its clear he regrets causing me this much pain. He was my first boyfriend and sexual partner - all I can think about is being in his arms right now.\n\nIndecision is killing me. Should I choose love, or self-respect?\n\n**EDIT: He would always say that I was the girl he wanted to marry, and that he was so lucky to have me around. He even said this to my friends and his friends. So what the fuck is his deal?**\n  Forgave a cheater, married him. Glad I did. Our situations sound different though. This is about you, not me so here's what I think.\n\nYou wrote that he thinks you love him more than he loves you. I just wonder why you would want to be with someone who would think that? It kind of says to me: \"I'm telling you right now, I don't love you as much as you love me, so maybe you should accept this behavior of mine.\"  The lows in your relationship were the worst he ever experienced, so he cheated? What's with that! You deserve someone who will confront the lows with you head on, not by retreating to someone else. He regrets causing you pain, and that's good, he should. But, does he regret the cheating and do you think he'll do it again?\n\nMy two cents: chose self respect. It's easier to sleep at night with your self respect than it is with a person you aren't sure you can trust.  Very true :)  Thank you.       I have taken a cheater back, and I regret it very much. He was also my first. I spent five or so years with him on and off after that, miserable and constantly anxious.  I always felt that for whatever reason I wasn't good enough, and that must have been why he cheated. There were so many opportunities for him to cheat again, I assumed it was inevitable. I wasted a lot of time worrying about him cheating on me, when I could have been in a great, worry-free relationship (like I am now) with someone else. My advice would be don't date anyone you don't trust 100%. I have taken a cheater back, and I regret it very much. He was also my first.

My advice would be don't date anyone you don't trust 100%. Did he cheat on you again?    It depends on a lot of things.  Some people find that infidelity gives them a massive kick up the ass to fix everything that was wrong in their relationship.  Some people paper over the cracks and are miserable and unfaithful forever.  Only you can decide which it is.\n\nImportant questions;\n\n* Why did he cheat? No one cheats on a perfect relationship.  Something was wrong, and if you don't fix that, nothing will improve.\n\n* What happened?  Was it a one night thing that he told you about immediately, or was it a longer term thing that he was actively hiding and lying to you about.  \n\n* Can you really put it behind you?  If you decide to stay together, you have to be able to forgive and forget.  No \"Well, you cheated so I get to do what I want\", no resentment, no retribution, no bringing it up when you're mad.  \n\nYou cannot decide to get over this, you can only decide to try. He said he cheated because we fought too much. But honestly, 50% of our fights stemmed from me believing he was being unfaithful, which turned out to be true. He said that it was during the \"lowest\" parts of the relationship that he strayed. But that is not true for all the times he cheated.\n\nIt was a long term thing. He lied to both me and the ex-gf he was still having sex with with. On top of hooking up with other girls immediately when we took breaks.\n\nI can put it behind him if he actively changes. Is he actively changing? No, not really. \n\nLol, typing this all out and I realize how much of an absolute asshole he is. I can't get back together with him.  &gt;But honestly, 50% of our fights stemmed from me believing he was being unfaithful, which turned out to be true.\n\nWell, not to defend him or anything, but why did you believe he was unfaithful when he wasn't? He actually was being unfaithful. In August, I'd seen some sexual texts on his phone and was suspicious. but he told me an elaborate false story saying that he and his friend sent them to \"increase the friend's self confidence and teach him how to talk to girls\". I believed that story but inwardly had doubts. Fast forward to now, and it turns out that he in fact DID send those messages himself and was having sex. \n\nWhenever we had fought, I would bring up the texts and say I could not trust him. It raised the levels of fights. A lot of times, fights started because I would bring up what happened and he would accuse me of not trusting him, etc. Such mind games.     Can you tell me what kind of \"cheating\" we're talking about here? Sex with his ex-gf from high school each time he would go home during college breaks (so about 6 times I would say). We had a bad fight (after I saw his sexting) and I told him that I did not want to be with him. He hooked up with a girl that night (kissing, she slept over). This past weekend, when I took a trip home to help me get over the cheating, he hooked up with another girl. he told me upfront about this, saying it was a mistake and he was upset that things had ended between us. \n\nLol, everytime i type this out I dont want anything to even do with him anymore.

If he cheats on you he doesn't consider you, of he doesn't consider you he doesn't respect you. You are smart and beautiful and strong and you shouldn't let anyone treat you any differently. Based on everything I've read you seem like your not going back with him, but I just want you to know it doesn't matter if he cheats on you again, because you were open with him and he was closed with you and he will always be able to close that door again if you ever take him back.\n\n Celebrate yourself, think about your future and everything you want. Sure there is probably a man there but he has to be there for you as a partner not use you as a step. This guy is not that guy unless he seriously works on himself away from you and then you're find each other in five years but even then would not at all be worth getting back with because your dating this really cute Hispanic chef who treat you like a queen and makes tacos after sex.   I did once. We were long distance at the time when he cheated. He called me the next day and told me about it, and apologized profusely. Even though we later broke up, it wasn't over that. If he'd wanted to hide it, I never would have known. But he owned up right away, which meant a lot. It really depends on the situation.  Meh. Fidelity is a choice we make and remake every day. After many years of living, observing and being in relationships I don't think long-term monogamy is a natural state for people. When I was cheated on years ago I ended the relationship but, six months later and after much thought, I wasn't sure I made the right decision. Yet now, many years later, I am very happy where I am with a wonderful SO who is much better for me than the one who cheated on me. Go figure.\n\nLife is like that. One door closes, another opens. Do what you need to do for yourself. It may end badly or it may bring much of what you hope for. The only thing an online forum can do for you is get you thinking about possibilities. Ultimately you will make your own decision. &gt; I don't think long-term monogamy is a natural state for people.\n\nI don't think it is either but it doesn't make cheating okay.  I don't understand why so many people think ethical consensual non-monogamy is so horrible but then they end up cheating on their partner when they want some novelty.  The sex isn't want makes cheating bad, its the lying and the deception.  I get that some people are not wired for monogamy (personally I prefer being non-monogamous) but that doesn't mean you can lie to your partner and fuck around without their consent.\n\nI wish we could push for a greater degree of consensual openness for those that want that, I just think it would be such a better way for people to get the novelty they may want every once in awhile without ruining the love and trust they already have with their primary partner. I agree with you. I finally realized that the actual cheating meant very little to me, the pattern of lying that led to it was the deal-breaker and ultimately why I did not attempt to reconcile.  Yep, its very strongly how I feel.  I get so angry when I see posts like this, it appalls me that people think its acceptable to lie like this to someone.    It's only been two weeks.  I recommend giving it some time.  My current SO drunkenly made out with some girl at a party.  At the time, we were having issues, and the infidelity just made me snap.  We were apart for a month and a half, but he kept pursuing me.  I also still wanted to see him, so we began dating again.  It has been completely different this time around.  I feel like he takes our relationship much more seriously now that he has experienced the consequences of breaking my trust.  Likewise, I have worked to be a better girlfriend to him.  Overall, things are great, and two months ago, I would have told you that he's scum and we're never ever ever getting back together.  \n\nAfter all that ramble, all I really have to say is, take some time.  Don't text, don't call, tell him to respect your space, and re-evaluate a month from now (at least).  Time will give you some more perspective, and right now, everything is probably too raw to have good perspective on the situation. When you were apart for the month and half, did you have contact with him? How often did you speak? How would he try and pursue you?  I have taken someone back who had cheated on me multiple times. It was an on/off again type of relationship for reasons unrelated to the cheating. All the signs of them were there even before we started seeing each other.\n\nWhile I believe some people can change, most people don't. The saying 'once a cheater always a cheater' is somewhat true in my experiences.\n\nThat one Taylor Swift [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y) comes to mind when I think about this.  I took a cheater back, only to get dumped after about 6 months because he didn't want to cheat on me again, but wanted to sleep with another woman. Similar thing happened with my first boyfriend. He cheated once, we reconciled, he cheated again, I returned his things... and broke most of what he gave me. Love is something two people feel mutually. You said yourself, he doesn't love you as much as you love him. Time to find someone who loves you as much as you love them. That's the whole reason for love, isn't it? A partnership, not one taking advantage of the others good intentions.  That is what I thought too. But he said that he wanted to marry me, be with me after college, have kids with me, etc. So this is why I don't understand what is going on. Before we would argue over who liked each other more. He swore that he liked me more.\n\nI am thinking that simply because I am still talking to him and deciding whether or not to be friends is astounding to him - so he thinks that my love for him must be greater than his. But I could be wrong.      ",

    "title" : "I deal with sexism at my workplace and I'm getting sick of it. It's actually hurting my sales commission.",
    "snippet" : "**I work at a bike shop currently, and the majority of the sexism comes from customers, but some from co-workers, too. I have a healthy amount of experience in this industry and culture, and while more and more women get involved all the time, there is still an overarching male dominance.**\n\n**For the most part the sexism I experience daily relates to my perceived inadequacy with the technical knowledge, physical strength, or the fact that girls just aren't supposed to like bikes.**\n\nThe reality is I have more experience than most of my co-workers, actually. I road on my high school's road and mountain bike team all four years, I also volunteered in the school's bike shop and learned mechanic skills. On top of that I have built multiple types of bike frames (different types of welding and brazing technics). Later on, I worked at a really nice shop and I was the only female employee out of 60. Yep. Still the only female at my new shop actually. I have also represented a company at the primary international convention for our industry. I wasn't a booth-babe, I was actually there to talk about the product. I have done all types of riding, from long-distance touring, to downhill mountain bike, to road, and I don't even own a car I just commute by bike. As you can tell I'm very passionate about everything relating to two-wheels :)\n\nIn comparison, some of my male co-workers are brand new to anything relating to bikes and just learn on the job as they go. Just enough to make a sale. It usually takes me longer to make a sale, especially with men ages 30-50. Also, totally not racist but just reporting that I find older asian men in particular are bad about this. I flat out can't make a sale to them and they always try to fact-check me against my male peers.\n\nAn example of what usually goes down is that a lot of men come in looking to buy something or get advice, but they totally overlook me unless it's to flirt. In fact, almost every week I'll have a different guy come in, describe an issue he's experiencing with his bike, and I'll answer in detail. Then he'll go, \"Um, I'm not sure about that, I'm going to go get his opinion\", and point to a male co-worker. I finally got fed up with it this week and said to one man, \"Okay, you're welcome to. But you'll just get the same response.\" I said it in as polite a tone as possible, but I needed to make it clear that I have trusted expertise and I'm not just some bimbo they threw on the floor to attract dudes in. Another thing that happens all the time is someone wants to look at a bike that's hanging on the ceiling. I do need to pull over a step-ladder, but besides that I can lift them just fine. Yet all the time I'll get some man rushing over to \"assist\" me. I hate this because 1) I don't need the help 2) it is embarrassing and gets everyone's attention 3) it makes me look like I'm incapable of doing one of my duties and I don't want my boss or co-workers thinking that and 4) I don't want to be held responsible if a customer gets hurt. I tell them I'm okay and they shouldn't help, but they just do it anyways. \n\nI am a very good employee and I don't do anything to make myself stand out as a woman. I wear the standard uniform shirt, relaxed jeans, and sneakers. I wear very simple, natural makeup and pull my hair back in a ponytail or braid most days. I always greet customers as soon as they walk through the door, smile and ask what I can help them with. I literally can't find a thing to separate me from my co-workers except my gender. And yes, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't attractive. But I can't help that and I sure as heck don't want it hurting my job.\n\n**Sorry for this being so long! I just needed to vent, but would also love some advice from other women who've experienced this type of sexism in the workplace and if you found ways to address it. It's making me not like going to work anymore and I'm not making as much money because I don't sell as much.**  I have no idea what you could possibly do, because the problem you're experiencing is a societal flaw that runs *deep*.\n\nI can only offer my sympathy and empathetic frustration at your situation :c\n\nAlso I guess maybe talk to your manager if they are a cool person and won't look down on you for it and see if they have advice/will give you permission to be just a little bit curt to customers like this?   I think it is unfair what you are experiencing.  I know female IT/tech support workers have the same problem.  Maybe you can get your coworkers to help.  If they notice that one of your customers is trying to get them to fact-check, they should say \"Don't worry, TheAdventureLady is an expert, she will take good care of you\" etc.  But I'm not sure if it's too competitive there because of the commision; they might not be willing to help.\n\nAnother possibility: I realize this is pretty ridiculous, but maybe you can try to adopt more of a \"bro\" personality.  Like maybe you can subconsciously psyche them out with a manly posture and voice.  I apologize for suggesting this because I think it is kind of offensive, and really you shouldn't have to act like a man for people to take you seriously.  I understand your frustration:/ I am not sure what you can really do about it, do you guys have name tags that say how many years you have experience or anything that might show them your knowledge? (I don't know :/) \n\nAlso, it would be cool if you could start your own shop someday :) No nametags unfortunately. I would love to have my own shop one day, actually! I always imagine what I'd do with it, and how I would make it a really welcoming place for women.  This explains a lot about the experience I had last summer. I went to look for a bike at a bike shop. I was almost completely ignored and when I asked for help I was dismissively waved toward a couple of pink \"women's bikes\" while the salesman walked away from me to continue his chat with another employee. \n\nI left the store pretty much immediately after that. I was a little upset at being treated so rudely. Now I have an idea why.  Oh, that really bums me out to hear :( Im sorry to hear that and hope you weren't discouraged from trying another store.    I was in the same situation for the 4ish years I worked at a bike shop! I wish I had something more constructive to say, but unfortunately I never figured out a great way to address it. What helped a bit was making my co-workers aware of the situation and also aware of my strengths as a salesperson. My co-workers were all into mtb, so I was usually the roadie expert on hand. Whenever they had a customer who was looking for a new road bike, they'd point them in my direction with a nice \"fiveminutedelay is our road expert here, so she can help you find the bike you're looking for\" or whatever. In exchange, I'd send customers their way for any mountain purchases.\n\nAlso, I talked with my manager about beefing up and reorganizing our women's section. Women were wayyyy more likely to buy something from me (especially if they were new to exercising or wanting to lose weight) than from one of the guys, so my boss was all for me taking charge of our product geared toward women and assisting any female customers who came through the door.\n\nHope that helps, and best of luck!   I deal with some of the same things at my job. I'm not in sales or customer service though, so I can get away with being more abrupt with people. I was going to suggest the same thing heinhrun said about asking your coworkers to back you up when people second-guess you. If a customer asks them a question that they know you just answered, they should answer briefly or admit they're not sure, then follow up with, *\"But you should really ask [TheAdventureLady] over there. She's a real expert in this type of thing.\"*  Some of your coworkers won't understand or won't do it. Others will get it and be pleased they can help set things right in the world.  \n\nIf there's a man standing in my work area (or even *near* it), other guys will *always* ask the man questions related to my job. Occasionally I have my boyfriend or a male friend visiting me at work. They know to respond to such inquiries with, \"I don't know man, I don't work here. You have to ask *her*.\" Sometimes, the question suddenly becomes much less important.  \n\nAs for people \"helping\" you lift things... I deal with this *all the fucking time* and it drives me nuts. The best way I've found is to act oblivious to their \"help\". I'll only say, \"No thanks, I've got it just fine\" once or twice before it becomes, \"Move please, coming through\" and eventually \"I've got it, get out the way!\" I do not allow people to take heavy things out of my hands. I just don't let go. \n\nDo you think maybe something like, \"Sir, could you move please. I'm going to set this down right there.\" would work? Is it possible to stand there with a bike held over your head while (politely) shooing them out of the way?  \n\nIt's easy to become bitter with people you think are going to give you trouble, but don't let it. Your attitude will obviously effect your sales. Keep cool and professional, act oblivious to flirtation, and never give them the satisfaction of knowing they got under your skin.",

As I'm leaving my mid-twenties, I'm ready for a change but I'm beyond scared and anxious to actually take the leap. \n\n* I've been working as a paralegal for the past couple of years, with no intention of going to law school or becoming a career paralegal (...I think). Over the past couple of years, I realized that my real interests are in nutrition, food policy, with some agriculture thrown in. I've thought a lot about going back to school to earn enough science credits to apply to grad school for something in those areas but it seems so daunting. I've spent four years (and a lot of money) in undergrad majoring in the 'wrong' subjects and I'm terrified that I'm just making another mistake - what if my interests in nutrition and food are just another whimsy? How do I even begin narrowing down these interests into one study and/or a viable career in the future?\n\n* I'll admit that becoming a career paralegal seems very appealing every once in awhile. I'm great at my job, the pay and benefits are decent, the hours are good, and I know that most of the time, I can leave work behind when I leave the office. I'm in a serious relationship right now and we've already started talking about marriage and kids and I know that I'll want to be able to spend quality time with my family on a constant basis. In a few years, I know I'll want the stability that being a paralegal will have to offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to have that sort of guarantee in the fields I'm thinking of pursuing. \n\n* I feel like I have unused potential and am capable of doing something awesome... if I ever decide on something. I want to do something that piques my interest, challenges me mentally, and at the end of the day, makes me feel like I did something worthwhile. On the same note, my parents want to see me do something challenging but their idea of real careers are doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc. (they're immigrants from Taiwan...) In the long run, I know that it's my life and I should be doing something that makes me happy, but the idea of disappointing my parents -after all that they did and still do for me- is upsetting and I'm afraid that reconciling my interests and their expectations will be nearly impossible. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text but I'd greatly appreciate it if any of you ladies have some advice and/or stories on how to deal with all of this. Every time I try to sit down and think about it, I only end up focusing on the uncertainty of it all, gnashing my teeth and having a small panic attack!    Have you thought about taking some free Coursera courses on food and nutrition, just to see how you like the coursework? It'll give you a feel for what it's like to take classes in the field without having to blow a ton of money on it right away. Then you can decide to either pursue it, or not.",

    "title" : "Online Dating - Expectation v Reality?",
    "snippet" : "I have some serious questions. I'm making my first foray into online dating. I'm meeting someone this Saturday. I am a chubby girl, some would say fat. But I'm cool with that. I like me and it's taken a while for me to be ok with my body. I'm a size US16 and decently proportioned. I have myself listed as \"full figured\" on my profile and include 3 pictures that I hope accurately depict my body, in addition to some face shots.\n\n\nHere are main questions: How does one deal with being a \"fat girl\" on a dating site? What if my appearance disapoints a potential partner when we actually meet? Is it their fault for interpreting my profile wrong? Should I out and out tell potential dates that I'm fat?    In case a guy chiming in is okay, the big thing is being honest. I went on a couple dates through OKC where the pictures were nothing like reality. Even though reality was perfectly fine, I didn't appreciate the \"lie\". If you've got representative full body shots, you'll already weed out anyone to whom that matters, and any dates you get will be fine with it because they know what to expect. Good luck!  I second this--my best (male) friend had a similar situation. Online, he met a girl who was absolutely stunning and cute as a button...but in reality, she was much shorter, and \"came out as a fat girl\" because she had taken misleading photos (mainly head shots). Initially, he was taken aback by the lie aspect of it (because why lie that early on, esp. when he was honest about his craft beer+gaming belly?), but liked her all the same. Some guys will get 100% turned off by lying about your appearance. Be honest and you'll find guys who are actually worth your time because they like the whole package, rather than liking the idea of yourself that you (OP) tried to put out.\n\nI hope that made sense. Good luck! :) What surprises me about Okcupid is how many girls just say they are curvy or heavier, props to them really.  Right? My sister is curvier and was honest about it when doing the online dating thing. She didn't seem to have any issue meeting guys and ended up marrying one of them, actually. \nGo forth and be proud of your body type! Others will pick up on what you're putting down.\n\n In case a guy chiming in is okay, the big thing is being honest.

You'd be surprised at how laidback it can be, even if you're a bit bigger. I was about the same size when I met my husband on okcupid, and there was no shortage of dates before that. Make sure you have at least one current waist-up type of picture, and at least one good headshot. They can see your general figure and that's as far as it needs to go. There's no need to \"come out\" as a \"fattie.\" Just enjoy yourself, be you, and things will go fine. \n\nJust remember that a lot of the beauty of online dating comes from the fact that you're able to get to know someone on a special level before they ever become tangible to you.

    "title" : "Scale Smashing",
    "snippet" : "Hello ladies!\nI am a sophomore at a women's college and for the most part my school does an amazing job of hosting events geared towards promoting the equality and self-esteem of women. I am always proud to say that I go here and have never had any opposition to things that go on. Until now. \n\nTomorrow on campus there is going to be a scale-smashing event. It is exactly what it sounds like. Girls are going to take their scales outside to the quad and smash them to pieces with a sledgehammer as a way of saying that women shouldn't have to conform to societies idea of the perfect weight. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I completely agree with the idea that everyone, men and women, should have a positive body image. My problem is the way this issue is being addressed. \n\nFirst of all, the announcement for this event was worded this way:\n\"We encourage anyone who is ready to bring your own scale to smash.\"\nImplying that 1) everyone will eventually come to the conclusion that they should destroy their scale, and 2) that the people who participate are somehow more \"enlightened\" than everyone else.\n\nMy other problem with this is that it implies that weight is not important at all. I've heard a lot of people recently trying to say that weight is somehow not related to health. Of course I don't think that anyone who isn't considered to be in a healthy weight range is horribly unhealthy, but the affects of being too thin or too heavy are real.\n\nI don't think that the purpose of this event is bad. I agree that many people may tie what they see on the scale to their self-esteem, self-worth, and body image. However, I don't think that smashing your scale solves the real issue.\n\nIf someone thinks that the number on their scale is a measure of their personality, talent, or anything else besides their relationship with gravity, then the problem is not with their scale, it is with his or herself. \n\nHas anyone else seen similar events? How did it turn out?\n\nTL;DR My normally awesome school is hosting an ignorant and condescending event.\n\n\nUpdate: The event has begun. It's across campus and my window is closed but I can still hear them screaming. As expected, it's just a huge group of girls fighting for attention. *sigh*  You are correct in that this really is a silly and unhelpful event. I personally rely on my scale to give me an idea of where I am physically and seeing a 2-3 lb increase is really helpful so that instead of needing to do a crazy diet plan when I gained 20 I just cut back for a few days and get my eating in line. As much as I understand eating disorders are a huge problem in this country there is way more of a problem from being overweight/obese.  [deleted] [deleted] How did you not notice on your clothing?   You are correct in that this really is a silly and unhelpful event. I personally rely on my scale to give me an idea of where I am physically and seeing a 2-3 lb increase is really helpful so that instead of needing to do a crazy diet plan when I gained 20 I just cut back for a few days and get my eating in line. As much as I understand eating disorders are a huge problem in this country there is way more of a problem from being overweight/obese.  A 2-3lb fluctuation is pretty much meaningless from day to day if you're staying in the same range -- unless you're really strict about your water and salt intake and weigh yourself at the same time every day. You are correct in that this really is a silly and unhelpful event. I personally rely on my scale to give me an idea of where I am physically and seeing a 2-3 lb increase is really helpful so that instead of needing to do a crazy diet plan when I gained 20 I just cut back for a few days and get my eating in line. As much as I understand eating disorders are a huge problem in this country there is way more of a problem from being overweight/obese.  Except eating disorders in children increased by 119% between 1999 and 2006 ([cnn](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/22/health/child-eating-disorders)).\n\nAnd studies are finding that being overweight may actually be 'healthier' for you, and it is only the severely obese that have a higher death risk ([Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2255685/Dreading-diet-Dont-worry--plump-people-live-LONGER-skinnier-counterparts.html)) To be fair, here is another article criticising the same study, with a response from the lead author ([The Australian](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/slightly-overweight-people-live-longer/story-e6frgcjx-1226546568124)). Did you actually look at that study? The basic indicators that they used were completely out of whack. They looked strictly at BMI which is a terrible indicator of health. The way that study was judged actually made it so an incredible number of really fit people were defined as \"overweight\" because they have a lot of muscle. Pretty much anyone who weight lifts even a little wound up in that category. That study has been criticized and halfway to debunked left and right. Walter Willet in particular has been a vocal opponent as to why the whole study is bunk and being presented in a poor manner. http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/02/168437030/research-a-little-extra-fat-may-help-you-live-longer\n\nYou will also notice that the study looked strictly at chances of being alive at the end, not at rate of diseases. They didn't look at any of a number of chronic diseases that you can live for years with and have a drastically lower quality of life such as diabetes, heart disease and others.  I'm against BMI as an indicator of health, but it is used consistently as a tool in research. You cant judge a research scientist for using the same tools as everyone in her field. \n\nAnd yes I read the actual paper,  it's a meta analysis of papers that excluded papers on adolescents and on those with reported medical conditions.  Its not a paper on the disease risk of weight classes. It's a paper on the overall rate of mortality based on the standard weight classes used in academia. \n\nYour claim that the BMI is not a good indicator of obesity is one you're going to have to take up with a large research cohort. I don't think your BMI should be the main indicator of an individuals health or their obesity status, but as a statistical tool for looking at whole poppulations it works. Your body builders and rugby players make up an insignificant portion of the population. I can judge the study though. Just because everyone else is using it as a tool doesn't mean it's in anyway a good tool. Using a poorly done study as the basis of your argument doesn't make your argument any better. In addition it's a grand total of one study vs all of the research that has been done on how being overweight is detrimental.  Except eating disorders in children increased by 119% between 1999 and 2006 ([cnn](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/22/health/child-eating-disorders)).\n\nAnd studies are finding that being overweight may actually be 'healthier' for you, and it is only the severely obese that have a higher death risk ([Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2255685/Dreading-diet-Dont-worry--plump-people-live-LONGER-skinnier-counterparts.html)) To be fair, here is another article criticising the same study, with a response from the lead author ([The Australian](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/slightly-overweight-people-live-longer/story-e6frgcjx-1226546568124)). This is the exact logic I'm talking about. People take the \"being overweight is healthier\" argument and turn it into \"I don't need to care about being obese because science says I'm healthy\". Not differentiating between what the scale says and how you feel about yourself is the real problem. Scales were just as common in 1999. It's not their fault that people have self-esteem issues, it is the people that misinterpret them. &gt;This is the exact logic I'm talking about. People take the \"being overweight is healthier\" argument and turn it into \"I don't need to care about being obese because science says I'm healthy\"\n\nHow about, my cholesterol levels, my triglycerides, my glucose response, my blood pressure, where my weight is located, and my fitness level, being a better indicator for my health than my weight?\n\nCongratulations, scales work well for you, they are a useful tool for many people. For a large number of other people scales are not helpful, and can be detrimental.\n If you recognize that a scale is not a good method for you of keeping track of your health then you are already ahead of the game. It's not about scales being wonderful and everyone should have one. The point is that if you aren't happy with it, smashing it isn't the answer. And neither is \"shaming\" the people who do use them and making them feel inferior.\n\nEdit: added \"for you\" in first sentence to clarify I can see the condescending attitude of the event organisers, but I still maintain that for a lot of people this could be a positive event. I wouldn't go to the event because I dislike senseless waste, but I'm not going to judge someone who finds the act of destroying a set of scales therapeutic.   Looks like I'm going against the trend here. I don't like scales. I rarely use one, because I know how easily it would turn into an obsession for me. Sure they are great tools for other people, but for a lot of people they are a source of shame, guilt, and obsession. Frankly, this sounds like a great event to me. For a lot of people getting rid of scales would be a very freeing act.\n\nAnd, I'd much rather go by measurements if I'm trying to lose weight to track my progress.  I understand that there are people who choose not to use a scale, and that's fine, to each his own. But why is it necessary to publicly smash it to pieces? Why can't you just get rid of it and not make a spectacle of it? It only makes the people who do use scales feel bad. Also, I liken this to that quote about being a lady; if you have to tell people that you're happy with your weight, you probably aren't. We all have our insecurities, and I would rather see a program that focuses on having a positive body image than this. Because it's a public event where you're supported by your peers? Because you're making a statement that scales are only a tool which don't have power of you, that you're not going to spend your time freaking out over the numbers on it anymore. Doing something publicly can be useful when starting a new routine, it means you're talking about your issues rather than hiding, and you've told people that you're doing something and can now be held accountable for that change. \n\nFrom what I'm getting, it's not an event saying that scales are evil and that all people who use them do it unhealthily. It's not about judging people, just like fat acceptance isn't about judging skinny people. It's about making a statement surrounded by people who support you, and who have more than likely been through the same issues you have.   Being obsessed with the scale and one's weight is generally not healthy.  And for most people, they can notice the small weight gains and losses by how their clothing fits.  \n\nI don't think the event is particularly helpful, but I don't see why it's ignorant or condescending. It seems ignorant because they're telling people that weight isn't important at all. Sure, it's not the most important thing and has nothing to do with one's value as a human being, but it's still important.\n\nAnd the condescending part comes from the announcement. The way it was phrased makes it seem like the girls who aren't prepared to go smash their scales are inferior.  I did not pick up the same implications from \"We encourage anyone who is ready to bring your own scale to smash.\" A glance at the comments already posted demonstrate how quickly a discussion like this turns into an \"Oh, no! I gained 2 lbs!\" \"Oh, no! I was a size 6 and now I'm a size 8!\" \"Oh no....!\" cluster-fuck.\n\nWhat I get from the concept of this scale-smashing thing is that too many people allow the scale to tell them how to feel about themselves, and for people like that, the scale needs to shut the fuck up. I recognize that many people can obsess over the scale, but I don't see how smashing it to bits solves anything. The problem with the scale is on the surface, but the bigger problem is lack of self-esteem, and that isn't being helped at all. And it's making the girls who do use scales in a healthy way second guess themselves. It doesn't make sense.  What ever happened to the good old fashioned bra burnings? You can throw off the shackles of the patriarchy and it keeps you nice and toasty on those cold February mornings.  A scale is a measurement tool. If I saw someone smashing a scale as a symbolic measure to show they don't conform to societies idea about weight I'd immediately assume that they are probably a person with a terrible body image as well as deep insecurity issues.

This has really been the way that I can get through anything, it's the pick me up for getting through a hard day, it's how I can remain calm at my job no matter what happens. It's been almost 20 years since I've started and lately it's the only thing that can get me through the day recently.\n\nI've tried to stop many times, and the last two years  but at the end it just never ends up sticking when something bad happens.

    "title" : "What is your opinion on virginity?",
    "snippet" : "Sorry, lots of questions here. \n\nIf you are no longer a virgin, what made you decide to have sex?\n\nWhat age do you think is appropriate to have sex? Do you think teenagers are having sex too early?\n\nI am a virgin. I'm asking this out of genuine curiousity. Personally, I don't plan on having sex anytime soon. I don't even have a boyfriend :p. I think people should have sex whenever they think they're ready to. For me, I'd like to wait for marriage, but it might happen sooner.\n\nThanks in advance!\n  I think \"virgin\" is a pretty antiquated term. I think it's led to more issues than solved them.  I was 21 and just wanted to get it over with. Whatever importance virginity had (or, alternatively, \"losing it\") in high school just didn't exist anymore...also, I was curious.\n\nI don't think there's an appropriate age, but at the same time, if you're incapable of discussing safe sex/what you're comfortable with/\"what if\" scenarios - then you probably shouldn't be having sex. Surelly there has got to be some minimum.  12?  11? 8?   The legal minimum age of consent is a good place to start. 18? \n\nIsn't that the minimum age of consent?  18? \n\nIsn't that the minimum age of consent?                      I hate everything about the concept of virginity.  Its antiquated, sex-negative, limiting, and heteronormative and it really isn't a good description of actual sexual experience.  I hate the idea of \"losing your virginity\" you don't \"lose\" anything by having sex you merely GAIN experience.  Its a celebration, not a loss, therefore I call it a \"sexual debut\".  \n\nI don't equate \"virginity\" or sex to piv the way the social concept seems to.  Piv sex is only one kind of sex and there are so many other ways to have sex and they are just as real and valid, that's why its called oral SEX, manual SEX, anal SEX.  As a bisexual woman this sex = piv sex thing really pisses me off since it implies that \"real sex\" is only between a man and a woman.  The sex I've had with women is just as real even though it didn't involve a penis.\n\nI consider the first time I had manual sex (fingering and hand jobs) at 16 to be my sexual debut.  That was the first time I became sexually active and it is when things changed for me.  The other acts I tried later didn't really change me too much, they only broadened my sexual menu.  I absolutely think that was a good time for me.  If anything I wish I'd been more sexual sooner and that it hadn't taken me as long to embrace my kinks as it did.  I just found myself being so much happier when I truly did accept my kinks.\n\nI still too this day think oral sex is my favorite kind of sex.  My sexuality consisted of masturbation (which I technically have been doing since early childhood) and after 16 consisted of oral and manual sex for many years.  I didn't actually have piv sex until I was 21.  That was a personal choice because I wasn't ready to risk pregnancy in high school.  At 19 I was ready for piv but it didn't happen because I went though a series of sexually incompatible bad relationships that ended before piv sex happened.  During that time I got really good at oral and manual sex and grew pretty kinky.  Before I'd had piv sex I had already been using sex toys including butt plugs.\n\nReally, piv sex was non-consequential by comparison.  After years of oral sex and other types of kink it was just another new thing, but it didn't change anything for me since I'd been sexually active for so many years prior.  I'm glad I have had so much experience, I've had multiple partners, group sex, kinky sex, anal sex, and it has made me so happy.  I love exploring and trying new things and I kind of wished I'd been more open sooner.  I could have explored a lot more in high school/early college then I did and I regret that somewhat.  I'm in a non-monogamous relationship with an amazing partner so I'm making up for lost time now.\n\nPersonally, I think waiting until marriage is pretty risky.  I understand waiting for commitment but until marriage is kind of naive.  Sexual compatibility is really important and its hard to know what you want and how your needs mesh with your partner if you have no experience.  Going into a marriage without knowing these things can lead to a lot of pain.  I've lived through sexual incompatibility and its really horrible.  I had an ex who had a low libido and he rejected me constantly.  I also had another ex who was selfish in bed and never reciprocated or cared about my pleasure.  I would've hated to discover those problems after having gotten married.  \n  I love your term \"sexual debut\"! I'm totally going to steal that.       &gt; If you are no longer a virgin, what made you decide to have sex?\n\nIt was the first week of my first relationship, when I was 18. He was gorgeous, as inexperienced as I was, but he also had a very calm steady manner, which was exactly the same manner I had. He was the first guy I felt genuinely like I *needed* to be closer with, it's pretty fucking powerful that, especially when it's new. We were just having fun and being awkward, we laughed, we kissed, and we got soooo much better. It was the start of university and I'd already had so many fun new experiences I figured I'd add sex to the list. \n\nLet me just chuck it out there, I have no idea exactly *when* I lost my virginity. It took a month or two to squeeze him in, and even then, when do you loose it? When you're 'entered'? When he cums? When you cum? It's ridiculously ambiguous. \n\n&gt; What age do you think is appropriate to have sex? Do you think teenagers are having sex too early?\n\nLook. That's harder to say. Some have very good experiences at ages I'd feel were too young, like 13. Some have very bad experiences at 20. I feel most comfortable with ages 16 and up, but to be quite frank, I'm not them, it was never anything to do with me, and so long as they were able to control it, and to take something positive away from it, then good on them. It's often not about age but about reasons. Wanting to wait is a great reason to wait, wanting to have and enjoy sex is a great reason to have sex. Wanting to have sex to save a pretty shitty relationship is not a great reason to have sex, which is what my friend did and it severely tainted her attitudes not just to herself, but to men, sex and intimacy. It's more about maturity and consequences than it is about age.     I'm not a big fan of the term \"virgin\" but I'll give your questions a shot.\n\nI first began engaging in various sexual activity (naked make-outs, manual and oral stimulation) when I was 18, as a freshman in college. A few months later, I first attempted vaginal sex with my boyfriend. I trusted him and felt very comfortable with him, which was definitely part of the decision. I also just wanted to have sex. Now, when I say \"attempted\" what I mean is that I experienced a LOT of tightness/pain at first, and so it actually took us a long time to work up to actual penetration, and even longer to have fun, meaningful sex. When I say a long time, I mean months. Keep in mind, my experience was unusual, but not unheard of.\n\nThis is why I'm not a really big fan of the concept of virginity -- when did I stop being a virgin? The first time I engaged in genital stimulation with someone else? The first time my boyfriend tried to put his penis in me? The first time he got it all the way in? The first time he ejaculated from having sex? We phrase it as this dichotomy, and I think that creates a lot of stress and confusion around one sexual activity (penis-in-vagina) among many. It's also very exclusive towards non-heterosexual intercourse. If virginity is defined as a penis being in a vagina, is a lesbian a virgin forever, even when she's done every girl-on-girl activity the world has to offer?\n\nI think that some teenagers have sex too soon, but I don't think that \"when\" is as much of an issue as \"how.\" I think a lot of teenagers feel pressured to have sex in risky or unhealthy situations -- casual sex when they really want intimacy, unprotected sex, sex in vulnerable places like parked cars at night, drunken party sex, sex because their partner wants it even if they don't, etc. A lot of teenagers (and adults!) are woefully misinformed and not given the tools and skills they need to be assertive about their boundaries and desires and to make informed decisions about sexual activity. I think the majority of people are not really ready for sex before about 15, but if you go over to /r/sex you will find both men and women who had sex earlier and do not feel it was a bad decision.\n\nSorry this was so long, but this is a topic I have TONS of thoughts on!\n\n  TwoX is very \"pro-sex\" (whatever that means) and they are very hostile to virgins.  Beware. \n\nMy personal opinion is that teenagers are too young to have sex and that sex should be only had in the context of a committed relationship that will eventually lead to marriage.  Unfortunately, because of the way our society is structured, with integrated schools and hyper-sexualized images coming in from the media every time, that is a difficult ideal to obtain.  Furthermore, people are getting married later and later in life (the average age of marriage jumped 8 years since 1971) so its very hard to wait from the time of puberty (around 12 or 13) to your mid-20s to have sex.  \n\nFurthermore, a lot of girls think they've met \"the one\" in high school but the reality is that people are very immature at that age and the person whom you think is \"the one\" could turn out to be a total dud.  Where are these mysterious posts that are hostile to \"virgins?\" I keep hearing this, yet no one can provide these so called hostile comments.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, a lot of girls think they've met \"the one\" in high school but the reality is that people are very immature at that age and the person whom you think is \"the one\" could turn out to be a total dud.\n\nThis can happen to people that are out of high school. TwoX is very \"pro-sex\" (whatever that means) and they are very hostile to virgins.

Shew, your first statement is a pretty harsh generalization, PourItUp. Jussayin'.\n\nAnyway, I'm a virgin to many things (skydiving, scuba diving, cliff diving... I don't know why I just went off on a \"diving\" theme...). *head tilt* :P\n\nI was 22 and in my first official relationship when I had my first sexual experiences. I was born and raised Catholic (went to Catholic school kindergarten to senior year of high school) but knew even as a young woman that I wouldn't wait 'til marriage like \"they\" told me I should. I do love the idea but I'm a pretty frisky critter and it just did not fit into my pragmatic lifestyle. I was a little older when I \"lost it\" but only because of circumstances and not any other particular reason.\n\nI don't feel there is a universal age minimum for sex, so it's hard to say. I guess there's some wisdom in waiting until legal adulthood so that it can be \"truly\" consensual. It's such a subjective topic, though.\n\nTo answer your question, I have no opinion on virginity. To each his/her own! As long as you're safe, happy and consensual, you do it whenever you're ready and don't worry about what other people think of your \"status.\" :) Don't pay any attention to her, she was trolling the other virginity thread all afternoon. If by \"trolling\" you mean posting opinions that people disagreed with, then yes, I was \"trolling.\"  TwoX is very \"pro-sex\" (whatever that means) and they are very hostile to virgins.

Way to be hostile to those of us that like casual sex.\n\n&gt;teenagers are too young to have sex and that sex should be only had in the context of a committed relationship that will eventually lead to marriage.\n\nYeah sorry 16 was the perfect time for me to have started having sex and if anything I regret not trying more sex and having more casual sex when I was young.  I felt too limited and afraid to go against the social norms and taboos.  Now I'm involved in the local kink community and finally getting to explore sex on my terms and I'm way happier because I am doing what is right for ME and no one else.\n\nLets not paint casual sex with one wide brush as being bad.  I've had good experiences and bad experiences but sex isn't necessarily better because you are in a relationship.  I've had very sexually incompatible relationships in the past where the sex was horrible and yet also had mutually negotiated and honest casual sex that was phenomenal since all my partners could agree on what they wanted and needed from the encounter.  Communication and honestly makes for good sex, it doesn't have to be in a committed relationship to be good.\n\nIf you think personally a committed relationship is necessary for you to enjoy sex then that's cool but I'm happiest with a mix of casual and committed like I experience in my current non-monogamous relationship.  Its what works for ME and for my partners and that's all that matters.  What works for one person may not work for someone else and so you have to do what is right for YOU.  But lets not paint all other choices with the bad brush, because they may be right for someone else.\n I never criticized people that like casual sex, I was just saying that there a lot of people hostile to religious people and/or those who choose remain virgins until marriage.  I have seen a lot of judgmental posts on this subreddit about that subject.  &gt;I never criticized people that like casual sex\n\nYes you did, I even quoted it, allow me to quote it again.\n\n&gt;teenagers are too young to have sex and that sex should be only had in the context of a committed relationship that will eventually lead to marriage.\n\nYou said sex should only be had in the context of a committed relationship, meaning anyone who chooses to have casual sex is doing something they \"shouldn't\" do.\n\nAlso I'm not understanding how warning people of the dangers of sexual incompatibility that often occurs when people get married without experiencing sex with their partner is \"being hostile\".  If someone was becoming sexually active I would warn them of the dangers of STI's and unwanted pregnancy so they could manage the risks.  That isn't considered \"being hostile\" to sexual people because its just common sex to fucking educate people.\n\nIts important to educate people who wait too because sexual incompatibility is a big risk and its much easier to end up in a sexually incompatible relationship if you commit without knowing your own needs and how they mesh with your partner's.  I wish someone had warned me about sexual incompatibility when I was a virgin because it would have allowed me to recognize it sooner in my relationships and to get out of them before my heart got broken.  I'm just trying to do the same thing for others so they don't have to go through the same kind of pain I did.  Everyone can still make their own decisions but just as there are risks to having sex there are risks to not having sex and I think people should be aware of both when they make their decisions. I was only quoting my personal belief.  I never criticized the \"people\" who like casual sex.  You can have a particular preference for doing things a certain way, and not criticize others that do it a different way.  You can say \"I think people should drink fruit smoothies every day\" without judging people who don't do that.  \n\nBut whatever, you just seem to want to start a fight.  I don't think a conversation with you will be productive. \n\n&gt; Its important to educate people who wait too because sexual incompatibility is a big risk and its much easier to end up in a sexually incompatible relationship if you commit without knowing your own needs and how they mesh with your partner's.\n\nOh hey, looks like you're \"criticizing\" virgins.  Pot, meet kettle.  I explained that I am educating people, not sure how thats different then educating people of the risks of having sex such as STI's and unwanted pregnancies.  Everything has a risk and you have to understand that when you make a decision.  I know that having lots of sex with lots of people makes me more prone to encountering STI's, I am glad I am educated about that and I manage that risk by getting tested often and using protection.  I didn't get all bent out of shape when someone told me that there was a risk to it.\n\nNot sure why someone would get upset when you educate them about the risks of not having sex and how it can be hurtful to a relationship.  How are those things different? &gt; I explained that I am educating people,\n\nOh, so you're educating people when telling them that their choices are wrong, but I am \"criticizing\" people.  Glad you cleared that up.  I'm not criticizing, its still your choice to make I just think its important to point out that waiting to have sex comes with risks too.  Just like I think its fair that people point out to me that my lifestyle of having lots of sex with multiple partners comes with a different kind of risk.  You make a decision based on what kind of risk you are willing to accept and move on with your life.  You'd be stupid to think that not having sex doesn't have its own risks. That's why its important to talk about those risk just as it is important to talk about the risks of sex.\n\nYou can't just say that not having sex will work out and you'll find your prince charming and know exactly what to do and have great sex and never have to worry about libido or kink incompatibility because that is a fucking lie.  Just like it would be a lie to say you can fuck around and not get tested for STI's and never have to worry about the consequences.  All decisions have consequences and I don't think its fair to anyone to deny those consequences.\n\nI accept that my lifestyle has risk and I manage it responsibility, is it really so unheard of to not ask that virgins do the same thing?  You take on a bigger risk of incompatibility as a virgin and that's okay if you are willing to accept that risk.  I accept that by having sex I risk other things.  You'd be naive to think your actions don't have consequences. [deleted]",

    "title" : "Wondering if anyone else has ever had any menstrual/pelvic problems like this?",
    "snippet" : "Hey ladies, I've been reading this subreddit for a while and I decided to make a throwaway to try to get some advice on some problems I've been having since August. I'm 20 years old and I am sexually active. \nIn August, I started experiencing excoriating pain in my lower right abdomnen. I was on the Depo shot at the time and I went to the hospital right away out of fear of appendicitis. I had a CT scan and an ultrasound that showed no signs of appendicitis or signs of anything being wrong. I was sent home. A few days later, I started throwing up all over the place and went back to the emergency room where I was admitted to the hospital for 2 nights. I had many tests and there were no signs of anything wrong except for my pain and I was sent home. Starting on August 31, I bled for an entire month. I opted to stop getting the Depo shot (which is the only form of birth control that I can use due to being on anti-seizure medication). I stopped the Depo because I have had the bleeding problem before that while on it. \nI saw a gynecologist in October who told me that I was \"probably fine\" and I should see a gastrointestinal doctor. I basically got tossed back and fourth between the gyn and the gi for months. Throughout this whole ordeal, it's also been extremely painful for me to have sex, I'm extremely bloated all the time and I look pregnant, and I am also severely fatigued all the time. \nIn January, my pain became unbearable and I went back to the hospital. They found a 1.5 cm cyst on my right ovary. They told me that was probably the culprit behind my pain over the past 5 months. I was sent back to the gynecologist. In January, I had two periods that both lasted 7 days and were awful. This time the gynecologist told me that my cyst could not possibly be causing me pain because it was too little and insisted that it was a gastrointestinal issue. I was sent back to the GI. I had an upper gi/small bowel series done that showed nothing wrong with my digestive tract but did show that my cyst had become complex. I was told to find a new gynecologist. I have Medicaid and it's really hard to find a gynecologist in my area who accepts it. \nLast week, my pain became absolutely unbearable again while I was visiting a friend about an hour and half away from where I live and she rushed me to the hospital. They said that all my tests came back normal and gave me a referral to a gynecologist in the area. The problem is that there aren't any appointments available until June so I'm pretty bummed about that. \nAnyways, has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I'm getting stressed. I'm so sorry that this is so all over the place. :(   Yikes... My mom just got out of the hospital for similar issues.  She apparently has a large cyst on her ovaries.  They are either going to freeze it off (they have done this to her before when she was younger) *or remove her ovaries (she's past the child-bearing age).  In all honesty, I'd say put forth the effort to find a gyno that will take it seriously.  A cyst can cause lots of pain regardless of how small it is.  \n\n*I don't know if this is actually a thing they do or if my mom was still doped up on pain meds and making shit up. Oh my goodness. I didn't know they could freeze cysts off, that's crazy. I'm trying really hard to find a gynecologist that will take me seriously. Hopefully I can find one soon!\nI hope your mom gets better! ",

    "title" : "Menstrual issues, I have an appointment scheduled, but am seeking advice/good vibes/etc.",
    "snippet" : "All right, obligatory apologies for a wall of text.\n\nI'm a 28 year old female.  About a year ago, I went through an incredibly stressful time, which had an effect on my period, I didn't have a period for almost six months.  I did spot here and there, but overall nothing.  I tested for pregnancy regularly, as I am sexually active (WD method or condoms).  I am uninsured, and aware that stress can mess with your period, so I didn't go to a doctor at that time.  I have actually never been to a gynecologist, I've spent most of my adult life uninsured, and before this recent issue, I had no problems.\n\nSo after a few months of little/no period, I started having a normal period for a couple months.  It was maybe lighter than normal, but it still came as it should.\n\nSlowly, this turned into my cycle shortening.  1 week of bleeding and two weeks between, then 1 week on and 1 week off, and so on.\n\nAs of now, I have been bleeding since January 29th.  The flow is mostly a moderate flow, like in the middle of a normal period.  However, some days the flow randomly picks up and is awful.  I have filled a diva cup to the point of leaking in 30 mins, to empty it and do the same thing again and again for several hours.  When it picks up like this, I am typically passing HUGE clots.  I started to get frustrated because the diva cup is not comfortable to take out/replace so frequently, so I switched back to tampons with pads as a backup.\n\nI have an appointment with Planned Parenthood this Saturday.  I work a 9-5 M-F, am uninsured, and cannot have any time off because of work obligations I need to take care of during the week, so driving 1.5 hours to them on a weekend is really the only way I can be seen by anyone.\n\nI do not currently take birth control and am slightly worried about taking it because my sister experienced bad heart-related side effects (we are very similar and have had similar reactions/allergies in the past).  She did try multiple kinds with similar results.  If birth control is the only thing that will get my period under control, then I'll do it, but I will have to closely monitor potential side effects.\n\nThey told me they can't do some diagnostics (pap smear) while I'm actively bleeding, but that they will see what they can do.  I am having to drive a long distance to see them, so I really hope they can help me.\n\nToday the flow is back to a normal flow, but yesterday I was soaking super plus tampons to the point of leaking every 30-60 mins.  Which is just awesome to deal with while trying to work productively.\n\nI am a little overweight, and I know this can impact the menstrual cycle, but I'm hoping they will look into short term and long term solutions with me and not just send me away and tell me to lose the weight.\n\nI'm just wondering, for anyone willing to share, have you experienced anything similar with long periods, heavy periods, etc?  When you got to a doctor, what was the determined cause, and how did they fix it?  I'm of course fearing things like cancer, but realizing that it could be fibroids, hormonal imbalance, etc.\n\nAlso looking for general advice for going to planned parenthood as someone who has never been to a gyno and is uninsured.  I can afford the $85 they said it would be for the appointment, but am worried about what additional stuff may cost and how they will work with me on that.  I really need it to be worth my while to go, because it is a long way to drive.  I tried to get an understanding about this when I was speaking to the woman who scheduled my appointment on the phone, but she mostly just wanted to get me scheduled to come in so they could try to figure out what's wrong, which is understandable.\n\nSo yeah, I know I should have gone to a gyno a long time ago, and probably should have gone when I missed periods/started experiencing the shortened cycle.  But I am scheduled now.  I'm worried and just wondering if anyone has any recommendations/advice/etc.\n\nApologies again for the wall of text, and thank you to anyone who made it this far.  Also thank you to anyone willing to share.  Could be a cyst.  I have a fybroid on my ovary and when it 'acts' up i get super heavy super painful super long periods.  It's usually marked by EXTREME pain for about 8 hours then i start bleeding HEAVILY. The pain will subside a bit but will not entirely go away for about 3 days.\n\nYou're health is more important than money.  go now worry about money later.\n\nGood luck See that's what's weird to me, the cramping really kicks in after the heavy bleeding has subsided.  With my normal periods, I would always cramp while the heavier bleeding was going on.\n\nI know my health is more important, but not all places will treat you if you're uninsured or if you don't have the money to pay that day.  I've also been working to pay off debt and am incredibly frustrated that I may be about to sink into debt after all the hard work I've put in.  I know I need to go, but I have concerns. Another fibroid sufferer here and I had the same thing- horrible bleeding to the point that I couldn't leave the house and cramping so badly that I'd throw up from the pain, pass out on the floor, it was terrible. Birth control fixed the problem, there are other options besides the pill though. \n\nI also wanted to mention that with the missing periods and then appearing like that you should look up PCOS because that was my first thought reading this. Also since you've been bleeding for a month you may want to watch your iron- take a supplement if you can stomach them or eat some good ole iron rich foods.   I did used to get terrible cramps when my period was regular, I would also throw up from the pain.  I've been lucky that the constant bleeding has been mostly cramp free.\n\nLooking into PCOS, I am experiencing a lot of those symptoms.  It will suck if that's what it is, but I suppose it's not the worst thing that it could be.  I feel your pain, girl. I've been dealing with period problems for awhile now as well. Just wanted to send you some good vibes &amp; virtual hugs =) Hugs to you too, hope you get your period problems worked out :-)  I had long-lasting and heavy periods. Was put on hormonal birth control at the age of 12. Probably just masked the problems, but I've been on it since then and now am sexually active (many years later).\n\nOne hormone-free birth control option is the paragard IUD. It can sometimes cause heavier bleeding, and may be an issue if you do have cysts, but it's worth the price (10+ years of protection) and is hormone-free if that's what you really need. I have 6 friends who've gotten it in the last few years and they've all had good luck.\n\nBest wishes on your appointment. Your best bet is to make a list of your symptoms, try to record when heavy bleeding vs cramping happens, and give them as much information as you can. Planned Parenthood is a great resource. \n\n&lt;3",

    "title" : "My sister is a manipulative, deadbeat single mother living at my dad's house. My dad is powerless to get her to do anything. Any advice? (warning: LONG)",
    "snippet" : "I'm really bad at writing these long detailed posts... if anything's unclear I'll try to clear them up in comments.\n\nMy sister got pregnant at 19 and had her son at 20. The father dumped her halfway through the pregnancy and isn't listed on the birth certificate. But at the same time he doesn't try to contact her, and my sister won't go after him for child support, because, as she puts it \"If I do that then it'll give him an opportunity to fight to see his son and I don't want that\" (even though he's just a lazy bum, not violent or drugged out) \n\nShe is currently 21, almost 22. She has only ever had one job ever. She worked at a tea shop for about 6 months when she was 17 and quit after she was institutionalized for swallowing a bottle of ibuprofen. She went to cosmetology school but refuses to go get her license to actually start practicing. She's stay at home but all she does is play video games, watch TV and go hang out with friends with my nephew in tow. My father has been powerless to criticize her or get her to do anything because she is manipulative and has learned the art of \"If you make me do something I don't like I'll (insert threat here - usually threats of cutting since she was into that, but she stopped that very quickly after she tried to blame her postpartum depression on me that she was going to start cutting but I told her I wouldn't hesitate to call CPS in a heartbeat if she did that)\n\nHere's where things get irritating:\n\n* My nephew is 18 months old. She does not have him on any sort of healthcare like healthwave or medicaid or any programs designed to help children of low-income families and single mothers. Why? Because in order to sign up for those, she has to name a father so they can go after child support, but she doesn't want him to have the opportunity to see his son, even though there's no guarantee he even would have that chance.\n* As you can guess from the above point, my nephew is VERY behind on his vaccinations. She cites that she's a fan of the \"Delayed vaccination\" route but you can tell from how she talks about it that she has no intention of vaccinating her son and only says \"We're just waiting til he's a little older\" to get people off her back. \n* 18 months old and breastfeeding is his PRIMARY source of nourishment. She is making NO efforts to wean him. He eats solid food and has all of his teeth for his age but she won't make any attempts to encourage him to eat solid food or, for that matter, get him on a regular eating schedule. She feeds him when he's hungry, never sits him down to eat, and often makes other people feed him for her.\n* My sister has diagnosed herself with [misophonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia), a hatred of sound. She reacts VIOLENTLY whenever she hears *anyone* chew, make any sound with their mouth, or even breathes heavily (flu and cold season drove her insane with all the sniffles and mouth breathing). She refuses to seek treatment for it or attempt to overcome it; instead she lets everyone know that she has the problem and expects everyone to cater to it, lest they suffer her wrath. I have NO idea how this is going to affect her son when he gets ahold of crunchy food. \n* She makes no effort to supervise her son. He will run around holding metal forks, spoons, keys, just about anything he can hold onto and could easily hurt himself. This actually reached a breaking point with me when I saw her encouraging him to push around some small magnets on the fridge that were small enough for him to swallow and end up in the hospital over. She rolled her eyes and said it was no big deal, and when I told her she needed to get her head out of her ass and stop being a shitty parent, she attacked me. The last time I told her she was a terrible parent before that she threw a 5lb towel rack at my head while holding her son at her hip. \n* My sister has not cleaned her bedroom in 19 months. She had a nesting moment about a month before she gave birth and cleaned her room spotless. Since then, her bedroom has been coated in a thick layer of clothes, both hers and her son's, that she refuses to remedy. She actually goes out and buys new clothes as opposed to sorting what's on the floor and cleaning it. There is also grime from who-knows-what all over the room and around his crib and you can imagine that yes, this poses a huge health risk for him. She has also overtaken my father's living room and refuses to clean up after herself. My father is 63 years old and can't keep up with the cleaning and maintenance so he just quietly deals with it, though it's visible that it's tearing him apart. Last Christmas I treated him by shoving everything from the living room into her bedroom and deep cleaning his carpet for him. I hadn't seen him smile so big since my college graduation and he was incredibly grateful, though you can imagine my sister was pissed that we moved everything.\n* The final clencher - her manipulation. Any and all criticism is responded to with \"He's my son, keep your nose out of it.\" or some variation on that theme. I'm 24, not living at home anymore and don't have any kids, so of course her retort is \"You've never been a mother or raised a kid so who are you to tell me what's wrong with my parenting?\" My dad won't kick her out because she has a child and of course it would tear him up from the inside to see his grandson living on the streets. He's powerless to do anything to get her motivated to do anything with her life because she won't hear any of it. She shuts people down the moment she's tired of a subject and often walks out of a room or starts screaming at them. She forces my dad to adhere to her odd schedule, meaning that if my nephew is sleeping (not napping) at 4pm when my dad comes home, she'll tear into him if he tries turning on the television to watch his favorite shows or catch the news. But for some reason it's totally okay if she booms dubstep at all other hours of the day at levels that are probably incredibly harmful to her son's hearing. \n\nOur older brother, my dad's first son, committed suicide in 2012. The last time my dad got onto her about where she's going in life she responded \"You've already had one kid commit suicide, I suggest you drop the subject.\" I wasn't there to hear this conversation but I'm pretty sure I would have gone to jail if I had. \n\nMy sister needs help. Psychological, social, all of that. My nephew (and my father) don't deserve any of this. My father is 2 years away from retirement and wants to live out his golden years in peace and have his home to himself. He deserves that. But he's so broken from her manipulation (our mother was emotionally abusive too, which made him very submissive) that he feels powerless to do anything.\n\nThe biggest fear I have, is anything happening to my father. It's his house. She's living under it. It's his grandson; his family. Meaning he's as responsible for his well being as she is. If anyone BUT him were to call to report any of my sister's behavior, he would be in just as much trouble as she would be because he let it all happen. But convincing my father to report her is useless. He's just as furious with her as everyone else is, he just feels powerless to do anything.  You should report her to child protective services. She is abusing that baby. 18 months and breastfed as a primary source of nutrients?! Refusing to get healthcare for her child just to stick it to her baby daddy?! Letting him run around with sharp things? It's only a matter of time before that little guy gets hurt. \n\nYour father isn't \"as responsible\" as she is, and unless she is physically abusing him or that kiddo is living in a house full of filth and hazards, he is probably not going to be charged with anything. Look into Failure to Report laws in your state, but any way you swing it, this is the wakeup call she needs and the help your nephew needs.  Have you considered just calling CPS and maybe taking the your nephew and sharing taking care of him with your father? Obviously you and he would both have to be on-board, but it would allow him to kick her out and hopefully she'll get her shit together.\n\nI don't think he would be just as responsible, especially if he's at work all day. I'm pretty sure if one parent called CPS or the cops on the other for being abusive, the reporting parent wouldn't be in trouble just because the abuse was happening under his roof. &gt;I'm pretty sure if one parent called CPS or the cops on the other for being abusive, the reporting parent wouldn't be in trouble just because the abuse was happening under his roof.\n\nMy thinking is if **I** were the one to call. If I called, wouldn't my father be at fault for allowing all of this to happen while a child was living under his roof?  Might be worth playing hardball with him. Tell him the exact time and date you ARE going to call. Come over for about an hour beforehand. Give him the chance to make the call himself. And then call at the appointed time. \n\nI know you love your dad and want to help him, but if he won't do what is needed to protect that child, HE **IS** GUILTY. His rights, his fucking feelings don't matter when there is a toddler's lifelong health and mental stability at stake. I don't want to alienate myself from him though. Failure to report is considered a misdemeanor at best and my dad has a perfect record. Pretty much telling him \"You need to report it or you're going to end up a criminal with possible jail time because I will if you don't\" isn't going to be the best way to do this.\n\nI need to emphasize the need for him to report it because of this reason though. If not me reporting, it will be someone else. It's a ticking time bomb and he's the only one who can stop it. I don't want to alienate myself from him though.

It's a ticking time bomb and he's the only one who can stop it. &gt;I'm pretty sure if one parent called CPS or the cops on the other for being abusive, the reporting parent wouldn't be in trouble just because the abuse was happening under his roof.\n\nMy thinking is if **I** were the one to call. If I called, wouldn't my father be at fault for allowing all of this to happen while a child was living under his roof?   To be fair about the breastfeeding thing: if it's really his only source of nutrition, that's not good at his age. However, there's nothing wrong with being breastfed at 18 months in conjunction with solid foods. \n\nhttp://www.babycenter.com/404_whats-the-best-time-to-wean-a-baby_3319.bc\n\nSupposedly, WHO even recommends breastfeeding at least 2 years! I think it's just not very common to see in the US, so we believe it's weird or unhealthy; in other countries I imagine it's not as strange of a sight to see a 12+ month old infant being breastfed.  I thought the WHO recommended that for nations where access to uncontaminated water is more difficult. For small children in developing nations, it is worlds more healthy to drink breastmilk than to drink water and eat food they don't yet have the immune system to handle, but in countries where that's not the case, there can be less pressure. That is a really good point. I might go check a few other places to see what I can find, because I am curious as to the age at which the benefits of breastfeeding for the child drop off. I guess I just didn't like that OP seemed to be having a knee-jerk reaction to the idea of breastfeeding after 12 months--as if it's this abhorrent thing that needs to be stopped as soon as the minimum requirement has been reached. :(  I thought the WHO recommended that for nations where access to uncontaminated water is more difficult. For small children in developing nations, it is worlds more healthy to drink breastmilk than to drink water and eat food they don't yet have the immune system to handle, but in countries where that's not the case, there can be less pressure.    Are you entirely sure she can't get him on Medicaid? (Ie maybe she's just lazy in that regard as well)\n\nMy sister never listed my nephews' father on the birth certificate because he went awol and is an absolute pos. She never once had issues getting him on Medicaid &amp; state based programs (in both redder than red and bluer than blue states)- and she did not have to give them the fathers' name to get the benefits.  I'll have to look into it but I know she's tried looking at Healthwave and they do require a father be named.  It sounds like you actually can report elder abuse in this case and help to keep your father out of trouble as well.  I could? How does that work? I thought elder abuse was only in situations where the elder was being given care, such as in a nursing home or assisted living?  Before you call, or try to get your dad to call, take pictures of everything. Get evidence and proof that these things are happening.  Sometimes CPS will call before they come, and she may try to clean things up, and put on an act that she is being a good parent.  \n\nIt would really help if your father made the call, or if you both do it.  You really want to avoid your nephew going into the system.  You may want to start preparing a room for him at your place, if you do want to get temporary custody. That way he won't even have to spend 1 day in a foster home.  If you want to keep custody, you should also talk to a lawyer. \n To be honest I'm not thinking of all this with the intent of gaining even temporary custody. I live in a one bedroom apartment and there's no room for him at my place. Truthfully I also do not want kids (I'm childfree). If anything I'd like for the birth father to have a shot at gaining some custody because while he was an idiot to knock her up, his parents were very excited when they heard they were going to be grandparents and were devastated when my sister ran them all out and refused contact.

    "snippet" : "I'm 17 years old, sexually active for 3 months (1 partner) and for the past few days I've been having a ridiculous itch that has almost made me cry because it was so aggravating and almost painful. It's driving me crazy. I've never had a yeast infection before, but I think I have one and every website I've been to tells me to go to the GYN if I've never had one before. I've also been having some soreness and thick and clumpy discharge. I was just wondering what I should know before going in. I'm making the appointment hopefully tomorrow (I tried today but we're in the middle of some ice right now; Everything is closed) and I just want to know what to expect I guess. I really want a female doctor... I just don't feel comfortable having an older man looking at me down there. Is that silly? Should I just get over it if I can't have a lady doctor? What are your experiences and what are they like? Do you feel comfortable?  It's TOTALLY not silly to want a female doctor. I have had both male and female doctors, but I am totally comfortable with having a male doctor. You don't need to change your mind or become comfortable with having a male doctor, though. Doctors don't get offended by this. They understand. And if they don't, too bad so sad for them. \n\nAnyway, remember to breathe. It's a bit awkward and uncomfortable the first time but they will never think \"OMG WHAT IS THIS WEIRD VAG UP IN HERE. WHAT A FREAK LOL\" so don't worry about that. Their main goal is to keep you healthy and informed. \n\nDo you guys use lube during sex at all? It's possible that your lube can be causing yeast infections, if you are. Glycerine can feed yeast and bacteria and cause itchiness and irritation. Don't be shy about telling your doc about your condom brand, your lube brand, or your soap brand. It's in your benefit to be honest. You can even tell them you're a bit shy and embarrassed if you need to. A good doctor won't judge you for it. \n\nThere IS a chance you won't like your doctors personality. That is okay. If you leave your appointment not feeling 100% comfortable, it's okay to shop around for a Gyno. I have lived in a new town for 2.5 years and I have seen 5 different doctors, no joke. It took a while to find one that had the same beliefs as me (pro-choice is Texas is tough sometimes), and one I could be honest with about my sex life/medical history. \n\nGood luck!  Oh my god! Where in texas? Ive been looking for a good doc, one that shares my pov on things like abortion and stuff but like you said, its hard to find here.  I always feel like my doc is judging me.  I am in Austin Houston. I guess my search continues. . . Poop! Good luck     Thank you! Yes, sometimes we do use lube, and I think we did the last few times before I started showing symptoms...hmmm.. I read somewhere a while back that either bacterial vaginosis or yeast infections can be caused by using a harsh or fragrant soap down there and I remember freaking out a bit about a week ago because I wasn't paying attention and got soap all up in there. But anyways, I'm rambling now I think lol :) But that makes me feel better about going! Also, what type of questions should I ask about birth control?

If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... \n\nIf it were me, if the symptoms didn't  go away after treating, then I'd hit up the doc.  Might save you the time and trouble.  If I have a yeast infection, I get almost immediate relief from over-the-counter meds.  There are treatments designed to take as little as one day (overnight) or up to a week.  Remember that you're hiring someone to do a job they've trained to do, nothing more.  Would you want a client to hire or not hire you based solely on your gender?  Go and do likewise. You know, I see what you are saying, but it isn't like you are hiring someone to paint your house when you pick out a gynecologist. If the OP feels more comfortable with a female doctor, then that is going to make her experience better overall. Especially since this is her first gyno appointment, being comfortable and getting used to having someone poke around down there is really important. Personally, if I were comparing two doctors with equal qualifications, but one made me feel less anxious while being there for whatever reason, I would have no problem picking that doctor. I don't think that she should rule out all male doctors on basis of gender alone, but I do think that, in this rather personal medical situation, taking gender into account isn't an invalid consideration. Here's a brain-teaser: let's say you have two gynos with equal qualifications, and just to make it easy, we'll say that they're both female.  One's black, and one's white.  Do you still advise the prospective patient to choose the one they're \"comfortable with,\" or do you advise them to get over their bias? I think that I would say that that is a very different [argument](http://d22zlbw5ff7yk5.cloudfront.net/images/uncaptioned-L1x4G-50f714ddb4062.jpeg). The original sentiment focuses on the commonality of what the doctor is examining and the physical characteristics that you both share, while your \"brain-teaser\" focuses on something outside of what the doctor is examining.\n\nUltimately, however, the OP has the right to hire whoever the hell she wants to. Okay, so back to the original sentiment: commonality of body parts, suggesting that a woman will be more comfortable having her reproductive organs examined by another woman.  By that logic, you want the doctor who sets your broken leg to have broken his own leg at some point, or that your cardiologist have had a heart attack, or that the neurosurgeon who does your lobotomy...well, you get the point.\n\nChoosing a female ob/gyn solely on the basis of her gender completely ignores much, much more important criteria like bedside manner, experience, religious beliefs (which, let's face it, is a factor these days), support for home birthing, etc. Remember that you're hiring someone to do a job they've trained to do, nothing more.  Would you want a client to hire or not hire you based solely on your gender?  Go and do likewise.",

Because every woman has her own reasons, her own story, her own need for accessible medication. Because sex is not a crime, and women shouldn't suffer penalties for it.\n*my comment with signing    As a Planned Parenthood intern, THANK YOU!  Signed!  My comment on it:\n\n\"Nobody should stand between a woman and her health, her decisions, and her future.\n\nThere are plenty of women, both religious and non-religious, who choose to use birth control on a daily basis.  Birth control allows women to have personal responsibility in making sure they do not procreate when a child is not wanted due to a multitude of reasons.  The choice to use birth control should only lie in the thought processes of a woman, and her own personal feelings on the matter.\n\nMaking birth control more accessible to those who cannot always afford it is a very potent move.  It will reduce the number of unwanted children born into families that abandon, abuse, neglect or otherwise raise a child who may end up mentally damaged from the way (s)he was raised.  It will reduce the number of children placed in the care of the state (for whatever reason), and reduce the number of children doomed to wait for forever homes, until they reach the age when the state kicks them into the world to sink or swim.\n\nPlease do not allow individual companies to make choices for the women that choose to be employed there.  Corporations and companies are not citizens.  Women are citizens.  Women are equal.  Women have struggled throughout the years... to vote, to have equal pay, to have equal treatment.  In this, you are able to put your foot down, and say women deserve to make a choice for their own medical treatment.  There is NOTHING wrong with this, and there is EVERYTHING wrong with trying to block it.\" We give shelter to the homeless, we give food to the needy, but do we really need to give free birth control to those who can't afford it?\n\nWe can live without sex. \n\nNothing in life is truly \"no-cost\". Someone, somewhere, will have to fund this. I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just asking, where is the money going to come from? \n\nAnd I'm sure there will be people who will say it's a slippery slope to \"no-cost\" abortions. While I don't believe that would really happen, I can agree that it's a very precarious ledge to stand on. We don't always give shelter or food.  There are issues elsewhere, yes... but less cost prohibitive birth control will help prevent some of the economic issues we have.\n\nThe cost of birth control would be less expensive than the cost of a child being in a state run facility from birth to age 18.\n\nThe cost of birth control would be less expensive than the cost of families being on food stamps and other programs.\n\nThe choice of what pill that has to be provided with no cost is up to the individual companies.  Right now, at Walmart, generic OrthoTriCyclen is $9 for a 30 day supply.  You cannot feed, cloth and house a child on 30 cents a  day... so offering birth control free seems more economical.\n\n\n\nSure, we can ask everyone not to have sex... but... I just don't believe that would happen.  Human nature just isn't built that way.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The following statement is NOT in reference to pregnancy that was not avoidable - rape and sexual molestation.\n\nAs for abortions, they should never be free and should never be covered until government care.  I'm all for choice, but if you can't be bothered to grab some free condoms or pop a free pill... I can't be bothered to see my hard-earned money paying for your abortion. I was nodding along with you until after your disclaimer.\n\nPeople get pregnant even when they're on birth control. People who cannot afford birth control let alone an abortion and require public assistance are disproportionately under the poverty line and under-educated. What seems simple and obvious to you and I may not be to them. This is a class issue, not an issue of willful ignorance or stupidity. Free birth control is completely affordable, though.  And I'm not sure I agree with the class issue vs ignorance/stupidity.  Sex ed and/or biology classes in school teach you that if you have sex, you could end up with a baby.  If you don't want a baby, you take steps to avoid a baby.  I can understand maybe homeschooled kids being ignorant, depending on what parents teach them, but no one else really has that excuse.\n\nAnd if the school doesn't have a sex ed program and somehow doesn't also have biology, that is a failing of the school system to properly educate the youth they are responsible for, and a school overhaul should be considered. To quote you:\n\n&gt;The cost of birth control would be less expensive than the cost of families being on food stamps and other programs.\n\nThis applies to abortion as well. We don't always give shelter or food.  There are issues elsewhere, yes... but less cost prohibitive birth control will help prevent some of the economic issues we have.\n\nThe cost of birth control would be less expensive than the cost of a child being in a state run facility from birth to age 18.\n\nThe cost of birth control would be less expensive than the cost of families being on food stamps and other programs.\n\nThe choice of what pill that has to be provided with no cost is up to the individual companies.

Less cost prohibitive and no-cost are not the same thing - unless I'm misreading things. $9 for a 4-week supply isn't free either. \n\nI think there are so many places that already offer free condoms - but not everyone is going to take advantage of that. Just like not everyone will take advantage of free birth control pills. \n\nI just think there are better ways to spend money than free birth control. \n\nIf I'm reading \"no-cost\" to be \"free\" incorrectly, I'm very sorry. But that's how it reads for me, and that's my biggest issue. I'm ALL FOR birth control and Planned Parenthood is an amazing establishment.       I'm really sorry. I love Planned Parenthood. I really do. I love affordable health care, and I love affordable birth-control. \n\nBut I just don't think it should be free (no-cost). \n\nThis is just too vague for me to stand behind it. What is the \"no-cost\" birth control? Are we talking about free condoms? Free BC pills? \n\nI would totally read more about this if anyone had the information handy. As I understand it, \"holding the line on 'no-cost' birth control\" means refusing to back down from the laws the ACA already has in place. This means that for insurance plans that have not been grandfathered, they must cover at least some birth control options without requiring a co-pay. This isn't truly \"free,\" as the insurance pays for it, and insurance in the US is typically part of an employee's compensation plan. At the end of the day, the employee earns everything inside that compensation plan. This means that technically the employee pays for their \"free\" birth control, but even if premiums are hiked birth control being covered by insurance is still cheaper than birth control via co-pay (or buying it outright).\n\nThere are various exceptions, i.e. Medicare/Medicaid, private insurance, religious groups, etc. that I have less expertise on and someone else should jump in to explain.\n\nBut frankly? It is my opinion that birth control should be completely free, every single type. It costs significantly less on the state to provide everyone with free birth control than it does to cover the costs of pregnancy and childbirth. Covering birth control makes financial sense.\n\nedit for clarity. Wow - thank you so much for this. I had a feeling that there might've been a disconnect between the \"free\" and \"no-cost\".  One of the biggest problem that they seem to be running into is corporations (Papa Johns, Hobby Lobby are two) that say they don't want to give employees insurance that covers free birth control for religious reasons.\n\nPapa Johns - this is a publicly traded company and (IMO) should not be able to deny employees hours/health insurance because of personal beliefs.\n\nHobby Lobby - this is a privately owned company that is Christian owned, but secularly run.  This company provided comprehensive health care - including birth control - to employees... but only had an issue because of Obamacare only.  It's hypocritical of them, IMO. I really would love to see a universal approach towards birth control as preventative care. More and more companies are covering an annual \"well woman exam\" as preventative care, and BC should be on that list too. I agree.  Sadly, the prevention of implantation and the abortion of an already implanted egg keep getting incorrectly interchanged in the eyes of some folks :( And truly, too few people understand that there are *many* reasons a woman would want to be on the birth control pill aside from preventing a pregnancy. My younger sister has been on the pill for a few years now and is still a virgin. It made me sad that my mother did some slut-shaming when I started the pill, and when she tried it with my sister I put her in her place.  I'm really sorry. I love Planned Parenthood. I really do. I love affordable health care, and I love affordable birth-control. \n\nBut I just don't think it should be free (no-cost). \n\nThis is just too vague for me to stand behind it. What is the \"no-cost\" birth control? Are we talking about free condoms? Free BC pills? \n\nI would totally read more about this if anyone had the information handy. I'd rather have my tax dollars go towards free BC to curb the amount of tax dollars going towards families who can't afford their kids. BC is the much cheaper option. The attitude of \"just don't have sex, then\" is honestly not going to happen in a widespread fashion.

I'm sorry if that read the wrong way. But in my mind, I'd rather my money go to feeding those who can't afford groceries, than giving a pill to a girl so she and her boyfriend don't make a baby.

Enlighten me. Someone had to pay for it - just not the person receiving it. This is factually inaccurate. Please see my comment below regarding how \"free\" birth control is paid for. Downside of free birth control? Enlighten me. Somebody's got to pay for it.  You can live without sex until you can pay for your own contraceptive. As a married woman who has chosen to not have children but could not afford birth control at this time if it weren't free to me, I respectfully disagree.

    "snippet" : "I am getting married in October.  My fiance and I are not religious at all but our families are.  His Jewish and mine Catholic.  I am getting so tired and offended by everyone asking us what religion our kids will be raised.  \n\nI have found these religion questions to be the worst from fellow Christians, they are disgusted that we are having a civil outdoor wedding and not being married in a church.  1. I don't care if my marriage isn't legitimate in God's eyes, I don't believe in him anyway. 2.  Why must you feel the need to voice such a negative comment to me about something that I am supposed to be happy about.  We have chosen this because this is what is best for us, I don't care if it isn't your idea of what is right.  \n\nI am really getting sick of people poking and prodding in my life.  We do want children and just planned on raising them to know and accept both religions (and know about all the others out there too).   Let our children decide what they want to be when they are old enough to. I have started to just answer that we can't have kids because it makes the questioner feel awkward for making me admit to this.  I just really hate how ruse people are. This is matter meant between me and my husband and no one else!! \n\n/rant.  *hugs* Families are (often) horrible and clingy and invasive, especially when it comes to weddings and children. \n\nI'd tell them that if they're so disgusted by your wedding, they don't have to attend. Being nosy and opinionated is one thing, being blatantly disrespectful is another.\n\nI'd also just rehearse the \"we're planning on raising our children to know and accept both religions\" line. And then refuse to discuss it further. Phrases like, \"I appreciate your opinion. I'll discuss it with my fiancé.\" can help diffuse situations too.\n\nI'd stick to your guns about this being *your* wedding, though. It's about you and your husband, not your extended families. If they can't accept your choices and wishes, they don't deserve your time and energy. I think I could accept it better if it was my family, but it isn't its either strangers or acquaintances.  I feel like its so obnoxious. I would never in a million years ask someone that or the ever so common and equally bad \"You've been married long enough why don't you have kids yet?\" \n\nI feel like people spend too much time trying to be PC without actually accomplishing it.  In that case, it's none of their business! And yes, it's very obnoxious. Either tell them to buzz off or say something vague like, \"My fiancé and I are making sure we choose what's best for our family.\" Yea, that seems like a great approach but I'm sure it will be met with a \"Jewish/Catholicism is the better choice for a happy family\".  I have answered a few times with \"Oh we haven't even discussed that yet\" and it's usually met with utter shock like we are so irresponsible for getting married without discussing it.  Who says we are even going to have children. Fuck it, tell them you plan on eating your babies, so religion doesn't matter. HA HA HA HA, can we be besties &lt;3 I think I could accept it better if it was my family, but it isn't its either strangers or acquaintances.  I feel like its so obnoxious. I would never in a million years ask someone that or the ever so common and equally bad \"You've been married long enough why don't you have kids yet?\" \n\nI feel like people spend too much time trying to be PC without actually accomplishing it.  If it's only strangers and acquaintances that are being obnoxious about this issue, then I'm curious why you share enough information with them that it would even occur to ask. If someone were engaging me in casual conversation, and mentioned something like \"My fiance and I are different religion\" I would assume that you were giving me information to feed the conversation, so I would ask open ended questions to continue the conversation. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say, is that by giving them the information that leads to the question that bothers you, you are somewhat inviting them to ask it, and they likely assume that because you brought it up, it's within your comfort zone. If something is private, keep it that way.   I feel the same. My SO's dad is a Christian pastor and his mother, of course, is also extremely religious as well as his entire family (except for him). I know they're going to freak when they find out that we will not be getting married in a church or have any prayers or any religious stuff at our wedding. As for kids his mom always says things like \"you're going to let take your future kids to church every Sunday, right? And teach them the bible?\" Drives me crazy. I'm really not looking forward to dealing with it. I can't even imagine how they'd treat us if they found out we have already had sex before being married! Some people just need to learn how to accept people's choices and not judge them. Best of luck to you.   For some reason a lot of people seem to think that as soon as somebody is planning on getting married they can be obtrusive and rude. I got married last month, untraditionally (out of the country, just my husband and I). I never heard the end of it, especially from older family members such as my grandmother. Eventually I just started responding \"This is what is right for us.\" and ignoring any further questions. Don't be rude, but I suggest you do the same. What you do with your life with YOUR husband and YOUR children is none of their business, especially when it comes to something so personal like religion. Yea it's tough... I swear some days I just feel like eloping because everyone has an opinion or comment about everything from our wedding song to our venue... Even the name of the officiant that is marrying us, like I have any control over someone else's name! It really just comes down to the fact that people don't realize they are being rude when they say the things they do.  A simple congratulations is all that is necessary when someone tells you about an event in their life they are excited about.  No one announces their joys to hear someone else's negative opinions about it.\n\nGood for you for doing what was best for you and your hubby Yea it's tough...

People don't know how to mind their own damn buisness!! It is up to you and your fiance how you want your wedding, how to raise your kids, where to live, etc....NO ONE ELSE should be telling you want to do. Just ignore everyone or tell them we are going to worship llamas, lol. Ha Ha Llamas! It's hard for me I am a very quiet passive person, my fiancé has been telling people that our kids will be raised Japanese.    I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this but whatever.\n\nFor intermarriage, how the kids are raised is one of the biggest issues that causes conflict &amp; divorce. And divorce rates are pretty high for intermarried couples. So it definitely is an issue that you and your husband-to-be should discuss in some detail.  I can tell you hair raising stories about one partner realizing that the children will go to hell, and divorcing and fighting and generally being horrible.  Anyway, your religious beliefs or lack thereof are your own business, BUT this is an issue that you and your SO should have discussed at length before getting married. We both are not religious but plan on raising our kids to know what Passover and Easter are and are about.  I don't see either of us banishing either religion or divorcing because  of religion based things.  I won't make my kids go to Sunday school or Hebrew school (unless they want to).  We were both forced into these things and hated it  I'll probably be downvoted to hell for this but whatever.\n\nFor intermarriage, how the kids are raised is one of the biggest issues that causes conflict &amp; divorce.

I hope it doesn't offend you if a Christian (and Mom of two kids) pops in with a comment, and I know that this doesn't matter to you, since you don't believe in God anyway, but how can anybody else pretend to know which marriages are legitimate \"in God's eyes\"? \n\nThis question might be more important than you realize for one big reason: You said that you plan to raise your children to know and accept both religions.  Does this mean that they'll learn about God, but that you think God isn't worth believing in and that you think God didn't accept your marriage?  That seems hypocritical, or at least there are some mixed messages going on there. (Many believe that God is loving and accepting, regardless of whether you married in a civil ceremony! Only a really bitter God would consider a marriage less legitimate because it was outdoors!)\n\nChildren have a huge interest in the beliefs of their parents.  And while it is best, as you say, to let them decide for themselves when they are older, the tendency of children *when they are younger* is to rely very heavily on their parents for their beliefs. Children are like blank slates wanting to be filled. It's impractical to expect them to \"wait\" until they are older before they start making preliminary decisions about their beliefs. Moreover, if your families detect a vacuum in your children's beliefs, understandably, their natural tendency will be to try to fill it! (And your children might respond by being fascinated with what your families have to offer.)\n\nIt is, of course, your choice (between you and your husband) to be as you wish to be. But one of the likely consequences of being ambivalent about religion or God is that your children will want to know WHY.  And while it's okay to brush off everybody else in the world because it is none of their business, your children will deserve a more solid set of explanations. (Yes, children are free to make their own choices, but they're going to want to know what *your* choices were and why.)\n\nSo setting aside the rudeness of the people around you, there's some future homework for you and your husband (after the wedding) in figuring out what you want to believe. Even if you solidly decide that atheism is right for you, it's better to know that, and know your reasoning, before your children are old enough to ask \"why?\". \n\n\n   &gt;  I am getting so tired and offended by everyone asking us what religion our kids will be raised.\n\nWhy would you offended at that question?  It's just a question.  A lot of people are proud of their religion and how they raise their children.  How would they know that you have some weird sensitivity to that question?   &gt;  I am getting so tired and offended by everyone asking us what religion our kids will be raised.\n\nWhy would you offended at that question?  It's just a question.  A lot of people are proud of their religion and how they raise their children.  How would they know that you have some weird sensitivity to that question?   It's the reactions to the OP's response that seem to be the issue. It's one thing to be curious about an upcoming milestone in someone's life, but to ask personal questions with the very thinly veiled intent of receiving validation for your own choices/beliefs is an entirely different thing. It's a case of \"I'm in this club, you should be in it too, *why wouldn't you want to be in it?!?!*\" and it is offensively inconsiderate behavior. So basically you're just making assumptions about their intentions.  Got it.  You are aware of the fact that you can decipher a person's intentions through things like words and actions, right? well i don't think asking what religion they are going to raise their children is offensive.  Also, I don't know what \"actions\" they are doing to show that they have bad intentions.  Read the OP.\n\n&gt; they are disgusted that we are having a civil outdoor wedding and not being married in a church. 1. I don't care if my marriage isn't legitimate in God's eyes, I don't believe in him anyway. 2. Why must you feel the need to voice such a negative comment to me about something that I am supposed to be happy about. that's a different part of her post than I was referring to.  I am referring to her first statement that she is disgusted by people asking what religion she will raise her child in.  It's intrusive. Some people find intrusive questions offensive idk So I guess you don't appreciate it when people ask about your relationships, your children, your work, your interests, your health, or your family?  All that could be interpreted as intrusive?  &gt;  I am getting so tired and offended by everyone asking us what religion our kids will be raised.\n\nWhy would you offended at that question?

    "snippet" : "\n  Is there a place you can find where they teach the students how to do hair.  That's how I got mine done, and it was a pretty decent cut.  It only cost me 20 bucks and I have that kind of hair that salons charge me 80 bucks for.\n\n[My hair before Tuesday and After Tuesday](http://codewolfnao.tumblr.com/post/43607135432/ive-transitioned-d)   As a stylist, please don't cut your own hair.\n\nFind a nice place, book extra time, express your frustrations and concerns to the stylist. Bring photos of what you like and be firm about things you dislike. If you end up with something you don't like TELL THE STYLIST. We can't read minds.\n\nAlso never go to super cuts and the like. A lot of students are told to go there after school if they don't feel confident, and it shows in their work. Ideally, that's what I'd do, but I don't have the budget for a non-super cuts stylist... I mentioned in the other comment also, I live hours away from even the nearest school where you can get a discounted cut from students. What about the creaclip though? I'm curious about it, it looks simple enough, it has good reviews? i wouldnt trust it, but thats probably because i went to beauty school and i know if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. plus 30 bucks plus shipping/tax? thats pretty close to an average salon price (like ULTA or REGIS)   The people who have done my hair actually operate out of their homes, and all the cuts I've gotten from them are great. I've never gone to Great Clips or anything like that, but I hope this helps.\n\nEdit: spelling  I'm super paranoid about my haircuts because my hair can either be gorgeous or I can look like a cocker spaniel...and I trend towards cocker spaniel unless I get a great cut. I've moved twice in two years and both times Yelp has been really helpful. I just found a place near me and got a great haircut for $40 when $80-$100 is the norm for a salon cut where I am. \n\nI would probably try looking around a little more before I'd buy that, but that's just me!  Ugh my hair's the exact same way. I put my hair in high pigtails once when I was a little girl and they really did look like Lady's ears lol I just looked at the creaclip and I think you'd want to invest in a good pair of scissors, too. I'd be nervous but I think my hair is too wavy/curly.

No use trying to cut split ends with a dull scissor :P\n\n&gt;\"layers\"\n\nlol I hope you have pictures!

    "title" : "'man'='human'?",
    "snippet" : "I started to see if I could look this up and then I figured I might as well ask you ladies. :)\n\nSo today at work my coworker started to write \"craftsmen\" out on a poster. Though I have been out of college for two years, I am still surprised when I say something about gendered language and people look at me like I'm crazy. We got into a discussion about the word \"man\" and apparently, according to my coworker and my manager, \"man\" means \"human\".\n\nMy manager also said, \"there are some feminists who don't like using 'craftswomen', etc. because it means that they are not human, because 'man' means 'human'. I have never heard this.\n\nI understand that some people do not see the importance of language, and honestly, I'm not going to make a huge deal about it in most cases, I just like to inform people to get them thinking at least. My coworker did make a new sign (because he messed up the original, not because of me :P) and wrote \"artisans\" instead.\n\nIs this a thing in some feminist circles? That we SHOULD use words ending in 'man' because 'woman' is not human?\n\nTLDR; told by coworker and manager that 'man'='human'.  Well, etymologically speaking...\n\nman comes to us from Old English *man* or *mann*, from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic (theoretical language that all germanic languages come from) *manwaz*. Both of these words meant person, without reference to gender. (As a fun side note, woman comes from the same, with prefix *wo-* meaning wife, so wife-person. The sometimes popular spelling womyn leaves out the personhood but keeps the wife... in fact *myn* is the Old English form of *mine* or *my*).\n\nNow, where it gets tricky is that in the move from Old English to Middle English, *man* becomes gendered in some cases, while retaining universalhood in others. Thus, the general case of man (all people) and man (male person) become conflated. Then, during the same period, the names of roles and proffesions become segregated (well, a lot of the already were, honestly) by gender, so we have craftsman, policeman, fishwife, and midwife.\n\nSo, from *my* feminist perspective, we ought to promote a language that de-genders those roles, perhaps by putting the Modern English universal, person, back into them (or a more topical but ungendered term, such as police officer or fish seller/monger). Barring that, a construction like \"craftswoman\" is sort of nice because it upsets the gendered assumption that all people who practice a craft are men, which is implied by the ubiquity of \"craftsman\" This is what I was going to say, but you explained it far better. Man originally just means 'person' and predates the word 'human' significantly. The wo- was a medieval prefix, to indicate a female or 'wife-person' while 'man' evolved to indicate the male version of man in common speech. There's inherent sexism in that males retained the default form while females were defined as their common relation to the \"default\" male man, but the original word was completely neutral.\n\nWhether a female craftsperson wants to refer to herself as a craftsman or craftswoman is totally up to her, but there's no contradiction in a woman identifying as part of mankind or as a craftsman/seaman/ombudsman etc. You could say, *man* meaning male became the unmarked term \\^_\\^ Hmm, I wouldn't say *man* in the sense of *male* became unmarked (assuming by that you mean that *man* as in *all humans* became marked). They both require different syntactic cues that lead to the semantic sense as well as having differing ability to be inflected.\n\nFor instance, *man* meaning *male* has a plural form. *Man* meaning *mankind* does not. *The man* meaning that particular male human, works fine whereas *the man* meaning \"the humans\" does not. *Man* in \"Man has taken great steps forward in technology\" can't mean one particular male and it's a stretch to take it to mean all humans of the male persuasion, exclusive of female humans. \n\nI'd argue that they are still lexically distinct and each is the unmarked term in certain syntactic contexts. Oh, I meant man (male) as opposed to woman.    Man does mean \"human\" *sometimes*. Not all the time.\n\nIn \"craftsman\" it doesn't mean human. It means man. Just like \"congressman\" means man and so when speaking about them in general and not just one specific congressman we use \"congress men and women\" or \"congress person\" now. \n\n\"Artisan\" is better. Best to replace gendered words with non gendered words whenever possible. Good on your coworker for making that switch.  &gt; Though I have been out of college for two years, I am still surprised when I say something about gendered language and people look at me like I'm crazy. \n\nDoes it surprise you that they look at you like you're crazy?  Because it shouldn't.\n\n\"Gendered\" is very much an academy word.  Something you hear in sociology classes and women's studies groups, but not really in the New York Times.  And that isn't really a bad thing.  You don't have to get all theoretical to point out how gendered language can be a problem.\n\nYou can just point out how only phrasing is more inclusive.  Like perhaps \"Woodworkers, Metalworkers and Other Artisans\" would work and draw people in a way craftsman wouldn't.\n\nI don't think words ending in -man are really gender neutral, but I think you shoot yourself in the foot when you make it a sociological discussion rather than a practical one.   I'm a community college drop out who's never taken a women's study class (though I have taken one sociology class).  Don't think I've ever read the New York Times for that matter, either.  I'm well aware of the word \"gendered\" and what it means.  I don't think we should necessarily lower the bar for people with poor vocabularies.\n\nThat said, I agree with your last paragraph, though OP didn't really tell us what language she used.  She says that she said something about gendered language.  Doesn't mean she necessarily used that word.  It might have been a very practical conversation for all we know. I'm not advocating lowering the bar for people with poor vocabularies, I'm in favor of not alienating people.  Plenty of well educated people would have no idea what \"gendered\" language means because it is mostly used in university classes and feminist blogs.   Doesn't sound like she alienated anybody.  The co-worker felt comfortable enough talking to her about the issue to bring up his point of view about some feminists disagreeing with her point.  But telling OP that she should not feel surprised to be looked at like she's crazy for using a fancy word sounded to me like she was being told to make sure she dumbs down her vocab for the possibly uneducated.  I probably jumped to a conclusion about your intent so I apologize for that. I'm a community college drop out who's never taken a women's study class (though I have taken one sociology class).

    "snippet" : "I had a nervous breakdown last year.\n\nNot anything in particular triggered it. I had just graduated college, where I had worked three jobs and held a full class load, and was working a high-stress advertising job. I hadn't dealt with any of the issues my parents' hideous divorce had created...just shoved them to the side. Really, it feels like I just was VERY depressed and anxious one day, and it stuck. And stuck. And stuck. \n\nI started therapy and medication, and things slowly got better. My fiance is very supportive, loving, and open throughout this whole process. I posted a while back on this subreddit about how one of the things I discussed with my therapist was my toxic relationship with my mother, and how uncomfortable it made me at the time. I cant believe it, but it's taken a year to click.\n\nMy mother is a narcissist. My mother is toxic, selfish, and hurtful, and she uses my brother as a foil to enforce her abuse when she isn't able to. My mother takes (and has always taken) advantage of the insecurity I feel in myself and in my convictions to bully me into accepting her way or her version of things, and to constantly undermine me and make me feel like I'm crazy. My mom takes possession of things that should belong to me (exercise and diet plans, heath insurance, what shoes I wear), makes them her own, and guilt trips me when I try to go a different route. My mom gleefully details to me her sex life and leaves for days-long trips to sleep over at strangers' houses. My mother (47) compares herself on a regular basis to myself (24) as if her issues and responsibilities are remotely similar to mine. My mother is never, ever, EVER wrong.\n\nI really do feel crazy. I feel like I am actually psychotic, thinking these thoughts. Because she and my brother constantly tell me I am.\n\nYou see, I stumbled on a website the other day titled \"Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers\". As I went through their information, I realized that the person they were describing was my mother. And that she had a scapegoat--me, because i always take it, and because i crave her acceptance--and a golden child--my brother, a useless, lazy, rude brat who can do no wrong, and whom she gangs up with on a regular basis to call me a \"crazy bitch\" (direct quote from my loving 17 yo brother!)\n\nLike the time my brother shattered the new iPhone my fiance and I bought him for Christmas, not even two months after receiving it, and he and my mother ganged up on me the next day that I was a crazy bitch and overreacting. \n\n(Nevermind that we barely have two pennies to rub together right now, with the wedding expenses looming.)\n\nLike the time my mother asked me EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. about what I had been eating and whether I would go to the gym that day or not, because she now goes to the gym 2x/day and basically subsists on nuts and berries. ANd when I asked her why she keeps insisting, she acted offended that I was asking, as if I didn't love her if I didn't put my entire diet in her hands as I did from the time I was born until the time I left home. Because my whole life, my mother has been a delicate bird and a dancer, and I am 6 feet tall, a size 14/16, have a fat chin and big boobs and make noise when I walk. Because she and my dad used to tell me I looked pregnant when I was a 13 year old size 10. Because she is a narcissist.\n\nOr how about the time that she announced that an old ex of hers--someone she rudely dumped in high school--was flying her to Prague for a week for her birthday. How about that time when I panicked, viscerally having a PTSD flashback to my father flying his mistress to Estonia so he could fuck her, and my childish fear that maybe my mommy wouldn't come back. how about her mocking me and laughing at me and hanging up on me, and then going anyway, without even providing me an address of where she is staying, half a world away.\n\nHow about when I asked my brother tonight if he hates me, and why he never calls, he told me that he was \"tired of my crazy bs...you freak out at me and mom all the time for nothing\". And when I pressed again, would he please call me once in a while, he simply said \"No thanks\".\n\nI feel lonely. I feel ugly. I feel angry. I feel sad. I feel like throwing up. Most of all, I feel like it shouldn't have taken me this long to have the breakthrough that all of this comes from my upbringing and the way I was taught to relate to others and how the others in my home related to me. Is it supposed to take this long? Am I crazy? Am I broken? Am I OK? Am I going to be a shitty mother, too?\n\nAnd where do I go from here? How do you go from calling every day (and getting your daily dose of Good Ole' mom's anxiety inducing dismissive conversation) to calling once a week? How do you explain to your captor why you suddenly can't talk to them anymore? How do you explain to your scared, needy, worried inner child that it's OK that you aren't good enough for mommy, because you can be good enough for you, and that's enough?\n\nHow do you start?\n\nHow does it end?\n\n\n(Thanks for listening.)\n\n  If you discover that somebody's adding cyanide to your coffee, you quit drinking the coffee. \n\nYou don't have to become her, but it really sounds like you need to stop drinking her coffee.  I want to. I have been trying, in one form or another, to quit my whole life. \n\nBut she is lonely. She has no friends, my brother is an emotional void that just takes without giving, and she has never been to therapy (refuses to go) for what happened with my father. I feel like if I abandon her too, it is a death sentence. And the guilt is overwhelming.  You are not her parent. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to make sure she's happy. She has been failing you your entire life, and making it YOUR fault. She's wrong and she's toxic and it's OK to be scared. It's OK to grieve for the relationship that you wanted, but didn't get. It's OK to mourn something that won't happen. At the end of the day, though, you have to let go.\n\nTake a deep breath, let it out slowly. It's going to be OK. Take all the \"I should's\" out. Find the ones that are killing you:\n\n\"I should eat, sleep, and otherwise exist as a healthy person\" can stay.\n\n\"I should call my mother because she'll feel better once she can put me down\" should not.\n\nFocus on taking care of yourself. This is not selfish. This is VITAL. Keep up the therapy, and PM if you ever need to.  Thank you. I might just take you up on that. I want to. I have been trying, in one form or another, to quit my whole life. \n\nBut she is lonely. She has no friends, my brother is an emotional void that just takes without giving, and she has never been to therapy (refuses to go) for what happened with my father. I feel like if I abandon her too, it is a death sentence. And the guilt is overwhelming.   It is tough, she is your mother (even if she doesn't act it). Both my parents were leading me down dark paths at different times in my life. My father barely spoke to me, never asked how I was doing, and never called. I craved acceptance and attention but it never came. One day I just got mad. I decided \"fine, if he doesn't want to talk, I will just return the favor. I only get stressed when I talk to him so I am cutting him out.\" I didn't speak to him for almost a year. After some soul searching, I finally felt strong enough to call him without having to feel obligated to prove something. I took control of my life. It worked. He still doesn't call often, but I now know I don't need him to validate my worth. Our relationship isn't the best, but it has gotten better (he confessed it helped him gain a little perspective on the matter). \n\nI'm battling with my mother and brother now. Both of them are severely depressed and feed on one another. They avoid confrontation, or as I call it, responsibility. My mom will stay in her bedroom for months at a time, only leaving to shower and eat. My brother calls in sick to work more than anyone I know... and I know people with debilitating conditions. They try to make me feel sorry for them when I'm around. I understand depression, I was depressed for years, but I have offered all kinds of help. When money is brought up, I refuse. That's where we get into trouble. My mom says it's easier for me to work, that I don't have to struggle as much. I tell her my life isn't easy, I just do what I need to on days I don't want to get out of bed. The rest falls into place. She won't hear it, accept any kind of help, won't go to counseling because \"it costs too much\" EVEN THOUGH I found her a free counselor. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, you don't need these negative people to control your life. You are the only one that counts in the end. If you want to change something, do it. If you like things the way they are, stay there. You don't need someone controlling your life who doesn't have control of their own. \n\nCut contact. Don't answer calls. Call when you feel strong enough to face the inevitable shit storm that is coming. If it doesn't happen for months or years, so be it. You don't need people trying to sabotage your happiness in your life. /rant  \"I don't like how you treat me. If you are nice to me, I'll call you all the time. If you're not nice to me, I won't call. It's pretty simple. The ball's in your court. Talk to you later.\" It is that easy, but it isn't. I wish I could explain. The thought of doing that gives me an overwhelming sense of fear, anxiety, and guilt.   &gt;Is it supposed to take this long?\n\nIt takes as long as it takes. For some people it takes longer than others. My MIL is also a unique kind of crazy, and at 18, my husband ended up having a breakdown on the Uni chaplain, went to Centrelink (Aussie government lot who deal with students, those on disability and other social security stuff) and basically THEY cut him off from his mother. His government record clearly shows (from the psych assessment they did at the time) that he suffers depression &amp; PTSD because of her.\n\nHe has siblings who somehow still live near their mother. I don't know how they can, especially since she was pretty much the same degree of toxic with all 7 of them as well.\n\n&gt;Am I crazy?\n\nNo, you have a toxic mother and brother.\n\n&gt;Am I broken?\n\nPossibly, but do not let that be all that you are, because it's not.\n\n&gt;Am I OK?\n\nIt doesn't sound like it right now. But you will be.\n\n&gt;Am I going to be a shitty mother, too?\n\nNO. You have a perfect example of what NOT to do with your kids. You just have to not go too far the other way. With a good partner, you'll do just fine.\n\n&gt;And where do I go from here?\n\nYou cut them off. My husband moved over 1,000kms to get away from his mother and start healing. We see her *maybe* once a year.\n\n&gt;How do you explain to your captor why you suddenly can't talk to them anymore?\n\n\"Mum, your behaviour is detrimental to my health, so I will not be talking to you any more. I love you, but you are constantly belittling me, which is abuse, and I will not have abuse in my life.\"\n\n&gt;How do you explain to your scared, needy, worried inner child that it's OK that you aren't good enough for mommy, because you can be good enough for you, and that's enough?\n\n\"Bitch, I'm fabulous! I don't need no nasty-ass bitches in my life!\" :)\n\n&gt;How do you start?\n\nYou stand up for yourself. You DO have it in you to, as well. Do not doubt your own strength.\n\n&gt;How does it end?\n\nThat depends on you and her. Maybe she'll realise what she's doing and change, maybe she won't. If she does, then it's up to you to decide whether you can forgive her and accept her back into your life.\n\nYour life. Your decision. And how do I fix what damage is already done? How do I learn to love myself and stop associating the necessary things of life--like exercise, eating, dressing well--with her? It is weird--the more she makes fun of how I look or asks about the gym, the less I care about my appearance and the less I care about my health. \n\nI just want to be in control again. But in her world, any opinion I have to the effect of... \"you are creating a toxic force in my life\" is the effect of me making something up so I have something to be sad about. She has said as much before.\n\nAnd, it would be cruel. My dad said the same thing to her when he left. And he is a narcissist too.",

    "snippet" : "25/f kinda accepted the fact that it would never happen! but it did! I have gotten laughed at when told people I hadn't had an orgasm before.  I have gotten close with partners, but being able to have my first orgasm by myself is what I really wanted. \n\nI'm kind of surprised how easy it was! I used a vibrator on my clitoris and got that feeling of warmth just spreading over my whole body was so nice! Soooo nice. \n\nJust wanted to share! \n\nThanks, ladies.\n\n*also I love you all for making this thread important!*  That's awesome! Congrats!

I remember I once saw a post, and all it was was a photo of a Hitachi Magic Wand, and said \"Ladies who've never had an orgasm, 1. Buy one of these 2. Think of something you like 3. Enjoy! Life is too short not to enjoy orgasms!\" and I did just that and it worked and it's been wonderful. Still have a really hard time without my wand, but this gives me hope for someday.\n\nI've noticed my orgasms aren't \"all over the body warmth\" but rather more like localized waves of sensation that swell and die down to sweet hypersensitivity. I suppose everyone's different! :) Enjoy! It gets easier the more you do it so have at it!! actually, i think that \"all over warmth\" is what precedes an orgasm, and the waves/swell is the \"real deal\" so to speak. when i hear girls say they have the warmth thing, i can't help but think that they haven't had it as good as it can get!

I'm 26, married and gave up years ago. *hugs*  D: go get a vibrator! I started without one and rarely ever use it but it might be easier for beginners. I've been doing it for years so I don't have a problem solo. With a partner is harder, so I say take them out of the equation and have a go yourself. That goes for all of you who haven't had one!\n\nWoman, love thyself! I've got several vibrators that are quite used, and I've tried quite a lot of other things too. I'm tempted to get a Hitachi magic wand and try one more time, but I just can't justify the cost right now.\n\nI do love myself, and it did take a while to get there as it is! It's the reason I gave up, orgasms are nice but they don't define how awesome I am :)  What about a shower head? If you've got a detachable \"massaging\" one it feels fucking incredible. I haven't orgasmed, but that's because I'm too terrified (mental block over anything else) and it feels amaaazing. Only downside is that if you have tank water it uses it up fast.. \n\nI guess it probably feels like what a vibrator does, but warm (assuming you choose a warm heat)? Assuming you already have one, could be a good idea.\n\nAlso, apparently you can do the same with a bath tub faucet, but mine's too close to the wall so I can't quite angle myself right.\n\nEDIT: Just realised this is my username for a good 90% of the internet, including some social media. Uh. Oh well, sex-positive, right? This is my default username too, I always mean to post on a throwaway and then just never bother :) \n\nI've thought about getting a detachable showerhead, once I move out of my apartment I may finally do it. I've never managed to angle myself right with the tub faucet, whoever pulls that off has really awesome bend-o-flex hips! \n\nI have mental issues too, they're not actively in my brain stopping me from enjoying myself but it's probably a factor which is why I've just thrown up my hands at this point.

Leave the bath water in there and get the shower head down in the water.

Yeah, unfortunately my shower and bath are separate :S but I still have fun in the shower, haha.\n\nJealous of you though! That sounds lovely - nice and warm, as well as fucking amazing (I'd assume).

Congratulations! 28 here and still haven't. :( What did you do when you tried to have an orgasm? Single sex, partner sex, vibrator, porn, everything. I was sexually abused when I was 6 and I think that has something to do w it  Single sex, partner sex, vibrator, porn, everything. I was sexually abused when I was 6 and I think that has something to do w it  That very well could be the reason why. Orgasms are a mental thing. I cant do it if my mind is not in it. Have you considered hypnotherapy? It could help you clear your mind and relax and get your mind right to enjoy sex. If that makes any sense. \n\nI have some issues too, and if I hear a bad story on the news or something, it traumatizes me and it takes me weeks to get back in the right frame of mind to enjoy myself again.  Makes me mad that it has affected my life so much even over 20 years later. I was raped at 15. I am in my 30s now and it still affects my sex life. Its really hit or miss for me. I have to be really careful about reading/watching news, because stories about any type of sexual assault really affect me. I have been to counseling and I have considered hypnotherapy, just so I can clear my mind from all the bad thoughts when I am trying to be intimate with my husband. Sometimes they just creep up. Sometimes they dont and those are the times I am able to fully enjoy myself.  Have you looked into MDMA-assisted therapy (perhaps \"unprofessionally with your partner)?  It's currently being used to treat soldiers with PTSD and rape survivors with chronic PTSD (not sure of the difference).  It seems to do a remarkable job of sort of forcing your brain to feel certain wonderful feelings again.    This sounds like a pretty good idea. Makes me mad that it has affected my life so much even over 20 years later. Same here, I was sexually abused and blackmailed by my neighbor who was only a few years older than me at the time. 20 years later I still can't seem to let go subconsciously. Luckily I can reach orgasm alone easily but with anyone even in the same room or close by it becomes a challenge. It's funny how our minds work even when we have logically dealt with the issue. /hugs! I know that exact feeling. I've had partners since who get frustrated and then take it personally. I think that is the hardest to deal with.  Single sex, partner sex, vibrator, porn, everything.

Many women don't hit their sexy peak til their 30s... keep on keeping on.

It only gets better from there, once you figure it out its easy.   Well, I'm close to 26 and I still haven't gotten there.  I haven't figured it out yet :-/ Which is an odd concept to me, since I sorta live in this body and I still don't know how it works!  I was 25 when I had my first as well. I'd had multiple partners but had never gotten there. One day I figured out how to do it solo. I \"practiced\" and got good at figuring out what worked for me. The very next time I had a new partner, Whammo! Orgasm! I was still pretty surprised by it because I didn't expect it to happen, but now it happens more often than not as long as I don't have a selfish partner. I'm sure you've got many more orgasms in your future. :)  21 here, still haven't had my grand finale. Nearly 23, same. *hugs* Maybe one day... I think there a lot of emotional aspects to it rather than sexual. That's what really holds me back. I think there a lot of emotional aspects to it rather than sexual. That's what really holds me back. viewing it as purely physical and not emotional is its own issue, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that you have a very intensely concentrated bundle of nerve endings that you can stimulate It can be more complex than this. A life time of abuse, lies, shame, or any number of (other) things can work at you subconsciously and sabotage the entire ordeal, even if you approach it in a purely objective, mechanical manner. Speaking from experience, just because you have a push-to-win button doesn't mean it works right out of the box. These things take practice. There's a million and one reasons behind why orgasm does or doesn't \"work\" for a lady. It can be more complex than this.

I'm just wandering, the women who've never orgasmed before, do you try vibrators and it just doesn't do much for you, or don't you use a vibrator? Just genuinely curious. I had one for over a year before I managed! Of course, I think I only tried a dozen times over that year, but I wasn't super determined...\n\n...shit, people who know me know my username OH WELL HI GUYS I'm just wandering, the women who've never orgasmed before, do you try vibrators and it just doesn't do much for you, or don't you use a vibrator? Just genuinely curious. I've used vibrators before. I'd honestly rather be with someone than a toy. My overall issue is that I view sex as just sex, no emotional attachments to it. When I was younger I would pretty much have sex with whoever I came across. It's different now. I haven't had sex in a year except the beginning of the year I came across someone I actually really like. We did have sex but I was really drunk and viewed it again, as just sex and nothing more. I want my next time with him to actually be special. So again, overall it is something emotional with me that's keeping me back. And that could be an issue a lot of women are facing. I'm just wandering, the women who've never orgasmed before, do you try vibrators and it just doesn't do much for you, or don't you use a vibrator? Just genuinely curious. This is a good question. I've seen with some of my female friends that their bodies have no problem relaxing to a vibrator and having fun, while others (myself included) have a harder time. \n\nUltimately, masturbation takes PRACTICE. Media, pop culture, things like this would have you think otherwise but it's not the case. Especially in our society where women are, more often than not, shamed for being sexual in any capacity from the moment they hit puberty (or even before that). So a lot of ladies try to masturbate and any number of things could be going on in the background making the effort hard or impossible. Biology, as some commenters have added, is just a part of it. Something as simple as needing to pee, but not enough to warrant an immediate trip to the toilet can ruin an orgasm (by making it hard to reach plateau, less yet climax). Hunger, stress, lack of sleep, feeling pressed for time, having a large agenda(schedule) etc.\n\nEdit: typo I'm just wandering, the women who've never orgasmed before, do you try vibrators and it just doesn't do much for you, or don't you use a vibrator?

I'd had orgasms with partners but couldn't have one on my own until I turned 29! For real! Now I'm making up for lost time. I had 30 last night. It took me two hours but it was time well spent.\n\nEdit: what's the deal with these downvotes ladies? :/ Now *that's* a good Tuesday Congrats! I'd had orgasms with partners but couldn't have one on my own until I turned 29! For real! Now I'm making up for lost time. I had 30 last night. It took me two hours but it was time well spent.\n\nEdit: what's the deal with these downvotes ladies? :/ Regarding downvotes: I think people are assuming you are confusing some lower climax with an orgasm since 30 seems a little high and probably taxing on the energy stores in the body. I dunno though. Just a guess! Thanks for the insight! I'm pretty sure I can tell the difference but I understand the skepticism. It was certainly a record for me and I'm proud of how far I've come but I don't need to be plastering the number around so I'll keep it to myself from now on. I've done somewhere in the mid-twenties myself on a lazy afternoon, downvotes aside, don't feel weird/alone about your enthusiasm. We might not be able to pee standing up, but us girls can certainly take advantage of our quick recovery time post-orgasm. Agreed though, best Tuesday ever. &gt;take advantage of our quick recovery time\n\nI've always wondered whether there's something a bit wrong with me. I can recover (and enjoy the sensation) quickly, but a second orgasm would take me FOREVER (as in, 45mins+ when it takes me only 5-10 to orgasm the first time) so I just lose interest. I stopped ever trying for a third.  Same.. First one, no dramas.. But backing it up just never feels like it is worth the trouble. &gt;take advantage of our quick recovery time\n\nI've always wondered whether there's something a bit wrong with me.

I stopped ever trying for a third.  I've done somewhere in the mid-twenties myself on a lazy afternoon, downvotes aside, don't feel weird/alone about your enthusiasm. We might not be able to pee standing up, but us girls can certainly take advantage of our quick recovery time post-orgasm. Agreed though, best Tuesday ever. Aww thanks! I really appreciate your support and you mentioning your number too since I was starting to feel like a weirdo!  If you're a weirdo, there are many weirdos alongside you, me included, and say what you will about us, we know how to take advantage of an empty house and a free schedule Thanks for the insight! I'm pretty sure I can tell the difference but I understand the skepticism. It was certainly a record for me and I'm proud of how far I've come but I don't need to be plastering the number around so I'll keep it to myself from now on. &gt; proud of how far I've come\n\nlol. &gt; proud of how far I've come\n\nlol. Congrats! I'd had orgasms with partners but couldn't have one on my own until I turned 29! For real! Now I'm making up for lost time. I had 30 last night.

I'm 23, have yet to orgasm even though I use my vibrator and/or have sex nearly every night, and it's nice to know that I'm not alone in my quest.

I discovered the wonders of the massaging shower head.   Okay this is awkward but does anyone else feel like they have to pee during sex? I've even made sure to go to the bathroom before hand and I get this weird pressure that kind of feels like I'm about to burst but I fight it because it feels like I'm going to pee on him hahaha which would be really awkward.\n\nIs this the beginning of an orgasm? I don't even know uuugh.

Congrats! Power to you, bro/sis! *sister?   Woah! I think I was probably 7 or 8 when I had my first one... They have gotten better with time though! Used to be just smaller localized-ish ones (if that makes sense). Buuuuut since I was 22 or 23 they have turned into mind-numbing, body convulsing pleasure roller coasters.

    "snippet" : "Longtime lurker here.  I've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit that attack or question virgins for why they haven't had sex yet (whether they're saving for marriage, aren't ready, are unsure of their sexuality, or something else) and telling them that they should just \"try it.\"  I don't think it promotes a healthy dynamic.  I see this kind of thing in real life all the time.\n\nOne of my friends is a virgin and attracted to men, but only on an emotional level.  She thinks she wants to have sex someday, but she doesn't feel a desire right now.  Her other friends have told her that there's something wrong with her and she needs help straight away.  How can she want someone and not want to have sex with them?  She's 22, for crying out loud!  Now she feels like shit because she's a virgin and doesn't feel sexual desire.  This is not okay.\n\nWhat I want to get out there is that just because someone isn't having sex or has chosen not to, especially if they're in uni or older, doesn't mean they're slut-shaming or judging you for your sexual experiences.  Some of us have become deeply ashamed of our virginity because the media and our friends and peers are flashing SEXSEXSEX at us.  Please don't make this subreddit a place where virgins feel worse about their virginity.  How about we stop labeling people virgins because it's an arbitrary term that holds no practical meaning or value? Then, there will be nobody to shame. Everyone just has their level of sexual experience (whatever that may be) and that's that.\n\n(Clarification on virginity being arbitrary: it only refers to intercourse with a man. You can give BJs or have sex with a woman all the live-long day and still be considered a \"virgin.\" It's a ridiculous title, and no one deserves shame or praise for it. It means nothing.)  You are absolutely right. I knew girls in high school ( Catholic) who had anal sex instead of vaginal and still considered themselves virgins.

I agree that it is rather vague, since virginity is relative, but I don't think we should just abolish the term. It's like refusing to refer to someone as \"black.\" It's a descriptive term, and shouldn't have a negative connotation. By refusing to use the term \"virgin\" I feel like you're giving too much power to something that really shouldn't be viewed negatively. It's not always viewed negatively. A lot of people use it as a status symbol, and this tends to promote slut shaming. \n\nBlack is not a good metaphor. That is a cultural identity, a community, and no one every really disputes another person's blackness. It's also not something that can change across a person's lifetime. \n\nI'm not pulling this out of thin air, there is a whole movement of people trying to abolish the term. I hope more sociological studies are dedicated to this topic. I think more people need to realize virginity is not \"I had a penis put in my vagina\" or \"I put a penis in a vagina.\" It can be \"I had oral sex\" or \"I had some form of lesbian sex,\" \"I had anal sex,\" etc. I think we need more awareness of the fact that virginity does not necessary mean PIV sex between a hetero couple. \n\nEliminating the term is not going to affect slut shaming. People are still going to use \"statuses\" to make themselves feel better or belittle others, and I feel like that is an issue deeper than the words used to facilitate it. How about we stop labeling people virgins because it's an arbitrary term that holds no practical meaning or value? Then, there will be nobody to shame.

I don't see how deleting words out of the dictionary helps anything.  Did you read my clarification? By this definition, lesbians are lifelong virgins. Does that make any sense to you? And is it really healthy to take pride in virginity? This leads to a lot of girls doing anal and oral to avoid \"losing their virginity\" while still being sexually active. It also leads to a lot of myths about how STDs are spread and how to avoid pregnancy. I cannot think of one positive thing that this concept of \"virginity\" does for people or for culture. \n\n*edit: there is nothing wrong with doing anal or oral. But there is something wrong with maying to yourself about the fact that you are sexually active and could contract an STD. My only point is that this cultural obsession with purity is poisonous. If you wanna have sex, have sex.  Plus, it has a blatantly sexist history. The word \"virgin\" originally applied to women only. It still kinda does, No it doesn't, men can be virgins too. Maybe it had sexist origins, but they're not really relevant in modern society.

Let people live their own sex lives (or lack thereof) and leave them alone It's one thing to place personal significance on sex and another to take pride in being a virgin or being promiscuous or whatever.  I don't think placing significance on sex is something to be proud of or ashamed of, just as I don't think placing no significance on sex is something to be proud of or ashamed of.  As I read JediPsychologist's comment, it's more about the people who feel the need to inform everyone of their virginity or who feel superior to others because of of it.  Choosing how much of a sex life to have with whom is your business, but what you choose doesn't make you any better or worse than people who make a different decision.\n\nI think that our society's preoccupation with who is and isn't having sex with whom for whatever reason is unhealthy, and I think that society placing inherent value on sex is unhealthy, but I don't think that an individual placing value on sex or carefully picking and choosing who to have sex with and when is unhealthy. However, taking pride in that decision implies that you feel that you made the objectively superior decision rather than just the best decision for you. The same thing applies to the people (more frequently guys than girls in my experience) who take pride in the high number of people they've slept with.  \n\nIt's simply not healthy to measure your worth by your sexual experience or lack thereof, and it's not good to assume that the right choice for you is also the right choice for others.

Why don't we have similar words for other experiences? How come there isn't a word for people who have never been on a plane, or who have never cut their hair?

You're missing the point. \n\nNo one said it's unhealthy to not have had sex. We're saying it's unhealthy to fixate on an arbitrary status symbol. It's the term we take issue with, not the state of not having had sex. \n\nYou don't want to have sex? Awesome! Good for you! Stand up for your right to do with your body as you please. But don't get fixated on the need to maintain \"virginity.\" It doesn't mean anything.  &gt; But don't get fixated on the need to maintain \"virginity.\" It doesn't mean anything.\n\nOnce again, YOU seem to be missing MY point which is that \"virginity\" means A LOT to some people and its none of your business what they \"fixate\" on.  STOP JUDGING PEOPLE. \n\nEDIT: From the downvotes it appears that judging people for taking pride in virginity is perfectly acceptable on TwoX.  Heh.  In response to your edit: read what is being said. No one is hating on virgins. \n\n\nMe: \"Abstinence can be a very healthy choice. Fixating on labels, however, can be harmful.\" \n\nYou: \"STOP HATING ON VIRGINS!\"  You're saying that people shouldn't be proud to be virgins.  I disagree.   People should be proud of themselves for respecting their own needs, whatever form it may take.

I think you're focused on the symbolic meaning of \"virginity,\" whereas we're all pondering the effects of it in terms of semantics. We're having two completely different arguments whose points will never converge. Yes, it means a lot to people who have decided upon a specific time in their life they deem appropriate for having sex. For some, it's marriage, for others it's a specific age, for others it's finding the right partner. The fact remains that we have this term designated for people who have never had sex before and over time it has become almost synonymous with \"purity.\" [deleted] &gt; But don't get fixated on the need to maintain \"virginity.\" It doesn't mean anything.\n\nOnce again, YOU seem to be missing MY point which is that \"virginity\" means A LOT to some people and its none of your business what they \"fixate\" on.  STOP JUDGING PEOPLE. \n\nEDIT: From the downvotes it appears that judging people for taking pride in virginity is perfectly acceptable on TwoX.  Heh.  No one is being judged. Choosing to not have sex is a powerful choice, and can be an extremely healthy one. But when we train little girls to adhere to a pointless standard that only encompasses one narrow aspect of sexual life, they will bend over backwards - and put themselves in danger -to maintain it. \n\nI had friends who were waiting for marriage, but had oral and anal sex regularly. Nothing wrong with that on the surface, if that's what they want to do, great. But their reasons were unhealthy and they ended up with a lot of self hate. \n\nThe idea of virginity centers around \"purity.\" It's a false concept: what really is pure? And in it's most common usage, it only applies to intercourse. So right there it's already pointlessly narrow. But the thing about \"purity\" is that people become obsessed with it. And then girls end up hurting themselves just to conform to a pointless standard. \n\nIf you want to abstain, abstain. And you will be happier for having respected your own emotional needs. But don't let other people label you for that choice, it causes harm down the line. It sounds to me like you're taking one particular application of the term virgin and attaching it to the term as if that's entirely what it means or implies.\n\nVirginity is not intrinsically linked to the (mostly conservative Christian) purity movement. They don't own that concept. Plenty of people choose to remain virgins or use the term who are horrified by purity balls.\n\nWith regards to PIV-only virgins, what you're referring to there is more commonly known as \"technical virginity.\" It is not the standard definition of a virgin.\n\nAnd going beyond that, the term virgin is commonly applied to non-sexual situations, such as virgin hair (hair thay hasn't been dyed or processed), along with several agricultural uses. It usually applies to something \"untouched,\" unprocessed, or that hasn't been germinated. It definitely has a sexual undertone in that sense, but it still doesn't refer to sex.\n\nI can see wanting to strip virginity of its significance, but eliminating the term entirely is a bit silly since it still has a lot of use. ... I think it's pretty obvious I'm not talking about agriculture. \nYou're arguing past my point. There isn't really anything to address here.  So because you don't think people should be happy about being virgins, we should never use the word virgin? \n\nThat's silly to me. \n\nPeople on TwoX need to realize that some people take pride in being virgins, and they don't really care whether you think it's \"healthy\" or not.

I said nothing about virginity being something unhealthy.  &gt; It's ridiculous that we've come to place such a value on sex and virginity, it's not healthy.\n\nCome on.

I don't see how deleting words out of the dictionary helps anything.    Not all criticism is \"shaming.\"  You can criticize a person's choices without insulting them as a person.  A lot of the \"virgin shaming\" I see on this subreddit are people making perfectly rational points about the problems that could come up if a person chooses to get married before they have sex.  If I was making an important life decision I'd like to hear all sides of the story before I made my decision.   \n\nThat said, I also don't think that all criticism of promiscuous sexual behavior is \"shaming\" either.  There are dangers in having sex with tons of partners and shutting down all debate over these dangers by yelling \"slut shaming\" is counterproductive.

In any situation, not just here. &gt; Part of shaming to me is when people say a rational point, but then don't try to understand why someone else feels differently because they assume they are right.\n\nFor example, many of the people in this thread who think its unhealthy to \"fixate\" on being a virgin.  It's generally considered unhealthy to fixate on any one trait, ability, or characteristic. The only healthy \"fixation\" would be on making choices that are right for you at any given time, whether that be marrying before sex or having sex with multiple partners. \n\nBut fixating on remaining a virgin so much so that you do some of the crazy things that people do, like giving oral and not considering it to be \"sex\", that can put them at risk is not healthy. Fixating on having sex so much that you place yourself in risky situations and agree to things you aren't comfortable with just to have sex is also not healthy. \n\nAnd fixating on virginity changes the emphasis of choosing not to have sex from \"making the best decision for you\" to \"preserving something valuable whatever the cost.\" And why do we need different words for someone who last had sex 16 years ago and a 16 year old who has never had sex? Why can't we just call them both celibate instead, since they're both (presumably) making the same sexual decisions? Why should it matter that the one had sex 16 years ago? Are their current decisions any less valid or pure because of the decisions they made over a decade ago? It's silly that there are people who would view the person who had sex 16 years ago as less pure or deserving or less celibate than the person who hasn't had sex but who was only born 16 years ago. [deleted] The problem with the word \"proud\" is that it implies that it's objectively the right choice or a huge accomplishment. The reality is that you can be proud of making the best decision *for you* without necessarily being proud of \"being a virgin.\" If I said that I was proud of finishing a marathon, then it would imply that people who didn't finish the marathon have accomplished less (which is true). If you say, \"I'm proud to be a virgin on my wedding night,\" then it implies that anyone who isn't a virgin on their wedding night has accomplished less, which is false. \n\nIf what you mean by \"I'm proud to be a virgin on my wedding night,\" is, \"I'm proud that I made the right choice for me and stuck with it,\" that's fine. Just realize that that's not what people in general hear when you say it, just like if you heard me say, \"I'm proud to be a STEM major,\" you would also think that I was implying that the humanities are lesser. But if I said, \"I'm glad that I made this choice and proud that I stuck through it even when it was really hard,\" then you wouldn't feel any judgment and would recognize that I really had done something anyone could be proud of, even if they had chosen a different major. &gt; The problem with the word \"proud\" is that it implies that it's objectively the right choice or a huge accomplishment. \n\nAre you kidding me?  You are denigrating virgins for being proud of their virginity?  Do you denigrate Jews for being proud of being Jewish.  I mean, of course, according to your logic, if a Jew is proud of being Jewish then you are implying it's \"objectively the right choice or a huge accomplishment.\"  Therefore, nobody should be proud to be Jewish, or black, or a chef, or anything.   \n\nIt's absolutely incredible the arguments people make so they can denigrate and insult virgins.  I personally think choosing to abstain from casual sex is something to be proud of, AND it is an objectively better choice.  I also don't care what anybody else does or thinks, and I don't understand why they care about virgins.   You didn't read anything that I wrote. You're either trolling or looking for reasons to be enraged at anyone who tries to engage you reaonably.\n\n&gt;I personally think choosing to abstain from casual sex is something to be proud of, AND it is an objectively better choice.\n\nThis is **exactly** where your problem lies. Everyone else in this thread is saying that being a virgin is no worse *and no better* than not being a virgin, but because you believe that you are superior to everyone who made a different choice, you find it insulting to be treated as our equal. Nobody here has said that having sex is objectively better than not, though of course some people have expressed concerns about the risks of casual sex **and** the risks of remaining a virgin until marriage, all of which are valid. **You are the only person in this entire thread making blanket value judgments about virginity.**\n\nIt is not insulting virgins to tell them that they are no better than people who make a different but also harmless choice. It is insulting to imply that a choice that hurts no one instantly drops a person's value.\n\nAnd virginity is not an inherent quality like race. Being \"proud\" of your race typically means not being ashamed. There's a place in the middle that is actually healthier for everyone of every race and sexuality that says that you are who you are and nothing will change that and it doesn't make you better than anyone else. Virginity is a choice and is not inherently better than the choice to have sex. &gt; You didn't read anything that I wrote.\n\nNo I read it, you're trying to convince me that's its bad to be proud of being a virgin.  That's your main point.  \n\n&gt; Everyone else in this thread is saying that being a virgin is no worse and no better than not being a virgin, but because you believe that you are superior to everyone who made a different choice, you find it insulting to be treated as our equal.\n\nYou are not understanding what I wrote.  I do think abstaining from casual sex is a better choice, but I don't think I'm \"better\" than anybody else.  I don't give a fuck what anybody else does.  I just think its better for a person, any person, to not have casual sex.  I also believe that people should eat vegetables, not do drugs, exercise, and meditate.  It's my right as a human being to think that without being attacked.  If you're so secure in your casual sex choices, then why are you getting so defensive about somebody having a different opinion?  Maybe casual sex works for you - but when I have a child, I am going to teach them that its better to have sex within a relationship.  That's my choice.  \n\nHow about we make a deal?  You stop trying to force your opinions on me, and I won't force my opinions on you?  You live your life, I live mine.  Not all criticism is \"shaming.\"  You can criticize a person's choices without insulting them as a person.  A lot of the \"virgin shaming\" I see on this subreddit are people making perfectly rational points about the problems that could come up if a person chooses to get married before they have sex.  If I was making an important life decision I'd like to hear all sides of the story before I made my decision.   \n\nThat said, I also don't think that all criticism of promiscuous sexual behavior is \"shaming\" either.  There are dangers in having sex with tons of partners and shutting down all debate over these dangers by yelling \"slut shaming\" is counterproductive.  I like that you said \"choosing to get married before having sex\" rather than \"waiting to have sex until after marriage.\" I think it's the concept of \"waiting\" that bothers me, like there is a *wanting* for sex, but it's being suppressed. I don't think suppression is the best choice in all instances. [deleted] [deleted]  I haven't really seen any thing that points to virgins feeling worse about their virginity in this subreddit. Usually, it's virgins speaking about how their IRL friends/ peers make them feel bad. This whole subreddit usually has the philosophy of live and let live. Perhaps, there are a lot of sexual questions on this subreddit and virgins feel left out of the conversation?   This isn't just virgin shaming, or slut shaming in the opposite direction. It is person shaming. We shame people for making choices that differ from our own or the majority. We judge people by arbitrary standards that don't really matter. As long as the person is not harming themselves or another person I think we should support them. \n\nWe are women, we are strong, we are sentient, and most importantly we are human. We have the free will to make our own choices about our bodies. I think we should love ourselves, and one another regardless of those choices.  I don't see how it is \"shaming\" anyone to point out that there are risks to making the choice to enter into a life-long contract without getting realistic and practical information about a significant part of your lives together first. I wouldn't recommend that someone buy a house without getting a full structural check done, and in the same way I generally wouldn't recommend someone get married without living with and having sex with their partner beforehand. Now if you choose to do so - fine, it's not really any of my business either way. But if you specifically ask for my opinion, I'm going to give it to you.\n\nMost people commenting on this kind of issue are not raising concerns in order to be judgmental jerks and \"shame\" the people involved, they are raising concerns because they a) have been asked their opinion and b) care enough about the people involved to point out the potential downsides and the risks involved so the person can make a fully informed decision. I can love other people without blindly supporting everything they do and every choice they make in life. Giving gentle constructive criticism when specifically asked for an opinion is not an attack.  Examples of these mysteriously absent virgin-attacking posts on this pro-choice, \"it's your body\" subreddit please? The thread that was posted yesterday about waiting until marriage. http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wjd6/women_that_wait_til_marriage_for_sex_get_a_lot_of/\n\nThere are nearly 700 comments, but some of them were quite nasty.  There have actually been several posts about virgin-shaming lately, and it just seems like some community members can't understand why some people take significantly longer to become sexually active, or why they feel pressured to have sex when they don't want to. I haven't read the entire thread through yet - it was still fairly low-key the last time I had a chance to look through it yesterday - but when I did, I saw no such evidence of virgin shaming. I saw people sharing their concerns about people not taking into consideration things like sexual compatibility before making a life-altering choice like marriage. \n\nI'd be more interested if you'd link to specific comments that you consider virgin-shaming, so as to see what *you* define as shaming.  I wouldn't go as far as to call it \"virgin shaming\" but it definitely wasn't supportive, and yes, it was also judgmental of a woman's choice regarding her virginity. And yes, the discussion has that tone pretty much every time the subject is raised on this board.  It's a valid concern despite the wording chosen.  There is definitely a consideration here that there is a right choice and a wrong choice and people who make the \"wrong\" choice are heavily questioned and criticized. The thing is, those opinions only come up when people specifically ask for them. I don't have any reason to not share my opinion on a subject when I'm asked for it - even if it isn't the opinion you want to hear. \n\nYou ask me my opinion on waiting to have sex until after you're married? I will tell you that I think it is a stupid and outdated idea that puts the whole relationship at risk. So many relationships fail based on sexual incompatibility. These are risks that *I* don't think are worthwhile to take. \n\nI ask you your opinion on me having casual sex with a random assortment of different strangers every night, and you tell me that you think it's dangerous behaviour, and that I put myself at a high risk of contracting STIs, potential assault, and unwanted pregnancies? That's your opinion, which I sought out. You have every right to share it with me when I ask you. \n\nBut if I say I happily have sex with multiple random dudes, and that I am happy with my choice, and I don't care about anyone else's opinion, and you then choose to tell me that I'm going to burn in hell because I'm a dirty whore? That's shaming. \n\nIf you say that you're happily waiting until after marriage to have sex, because you believe in saving that intimacy for one single person and having one special moment, and that you've made this choice for yourself, without asking for my input, and I say \"oh stupid child, you're going to end up divorced and on welfare because your outdated and prudish ideals are setting you up for failure\"? That's shaming.\n\nThose things are different. Asking my opinion, and then not liking it, is NOT shaming. And I don't have to have a supportive opinion if I think people are making mistakes, or are not considering the consequences, and they ask me for my opinion. \n\nMy opinion doesn't have to be nice. It's mine.  The thing is, those opinions only come up when people specifically ask for them.

As a contributor to that thread I was quite glad to see that pretty much every response (until the OP started calling judgement on them) was supportive of a woman's right to choose and genuinely interested in the motivations behind such a life choice. \n\nAgain, please direct us towards these virgin shaming posts!  I'm not going to post every single post, but there were tons of people who just assumed that she was some type of Christian fundamentalist because she was a virgin, or that she was somehow judgmental of people who had sex.  OP was also accused of being \"anti-sex.\"  Basically, people projected every stereotype they've ever had of pro-virginity people onto OP.  Like for example: \n\n&gt; I tend to be wary when a woman tells me she's waiting for marriage, because in my personal life, these people have very sex-negative attitudes that border on sexism, judgement, and moral superiority. I'm from Texas, so that probably has a lot to do with it.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wjd6/women_that_wait_til_marriage_for_sex_get_a_lot_of/c8inl1h\n\n&gt; I would never downvote a woman who chooses to abstain until marriage. I would, however, downvote the hell out of a woman who chooses to abstain until marriage and says she is a better person than me for doing so.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wjd6/women_that_wait_til_marriage_for_sex_get_a_lot_of/c8iosq1\n\n&gt; I feel weird, though, whenever I hear folks saying they're waiting. I'm a better person for exploring my sexuality before getting married. I have tremendous emotional and physical happiness (as well as sadness) because of it. Knowing that folks are taking the risk on compatibility until they are legally bound to someone, just makes me sad for them.\n\nAlso, I think its interesting about how people accused OP of being judgmental but then said shit like \"I'm a better person for exploring my sexuality.\"  YOu're a better person?

Really?  &gt; \"I'm a better person for exploring my sexuality.\"\n\nI interpreted that as meaning positive self-growth - as in \"I am a better person now, than I was previously\". It's interesting that you chose to interpret it as a moral judgement.  It's the \"sad for them\" part that is the moral judgement.  I wouldn't really consider it a moral judgement to say that you're sad that someone is willing to take what you consider a risk that can often end in a great deal of misery and emotional turmoil and pain.\n\nI often find myself wondering how people choose to define morality in this sub. Obviously quite differently from me, in some cases. &gt; a risk that can often end in a great deal of misery and emotional turmoil and pain.\n\nWould you consider it a moral judgement if someone said they were sad for women who have sex (whatever your definition of sex is) with someone without a deep and lifelong commitment because they consider that a risky choice that often ends in a great deal of misery and emotional turmoil and pain. (And it does for many people. Both choices do).\n\nI think *both* are moral judgments. I don't really want to quibble over whether that's good or bad, or something everyone does or not. The point is that if someone is going to complain about one, they shouldn't be making the other. It doesn't matter which way around it is.

It is, in my opinion, if you don't have a valid reason to back up your sadness and it is completely rooted in emotion and your own personal sense of morality. \n\nMy sadness for someone taking a risk is based on watching that risk play out over and over again. I feel sad for people with cigarette addictions, because they risk their health, the health of those around them, and social stigma. I don't feel sad for them because I think I have an emotional response to cigarette smoking; I feel sad for them because it's a risk that could turn out badly for them. \n\nWhat's your sadness based on, for those girls who have sex with lots of different partners? \n I'm not going to post every single post, but there were tons of people who just assumed that she was some type of Christian fundamentalist because she was a virgin, or that she was somehow judgmental of people who had sex.

I think what's even more saddening is the downvoting of pro-virgin posts and upvoting of anti-virgin posts.  I understand that you're never supposed to complain about downvoting on reddit, but when its clear that the community is hostile to your opinions and beliefs, you're not going to want to open up and express yourself.  Mass upvoting or downvoting intimidates people who think differently and discourages people from agreeing or supporting different points of view.  Again, wtf are you talking about?

If people politely and non-judgmentally expressing their thoughts about saving sex for marriage is being interpreted as “virgin-shaming”, then that’s on the person feeling shamed and they were probably pretty insecure about their choice to begin with.

But when it comes to sex, it's either you are 100% compatible on the first go or your relationship is doomed.

I chose 12 shows, did the research on each one (Finding out if the wife was a homemaker, how many kids, what the husband did etc) made a timeline of the shows . I really have no clue from where to go from there except to show how the television influenced them, and how the roles changed over the years.\n\nI started on it by giving an example of this test that i found on reddit :p \n\nhttp://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/02/heres_the_1950s.php?page=2\n\n\nSoooo, TwoX. How do you think the women role in television has changed over the years?  Was it good or bad? Same generic sappy love story role or housewife? And how do you think it's affecting younger peoples perspective on how people should act?   I definitely think it has changed over time in a good way! They used to usually only be housewives and didn't really do much besides cook, clean, and take care of the kids (some even had maids for that work too!)\n\nNow there are a ton of TV shows, but women have plenty of different roles, it really just depends on the TV show. \n\nSome of my favorite shows are Parenthood, Dexter, and Workaholics. \n\nIn Dexter we see Deb and LaGuerta have power positions in the homicide department. \n\nIn Workaholics, Alice is their boss. \n\nParenthood has a bunch of family aspects but Julie was a lawyer while her husband, Joel, was a stay at home dad for awhile. Sarah is a single mom, was a bartender and then a photographer's assistant. \n\nNot to say I don't like those old shows either though, they can be fun to watch.  Is parenthood the one with Lorelei in it? If so, its awesome.  My sociology class in high school kind of did this, but we were supposed to see the shows as representing that decades culture. I think we saw I love Lucy, my so called life, the dick van dyke show, desperate housewives, and threes company.",

    "snippet" : "TwoX.. I'm kind of freaked out by my pre-period pee! About 3-5 days before I get my period, my urine seems more concentrated and has a weird odor. Does anyone else experience something like this?\n\nA little about me: I am 24 years old. I was on Gianvi (generic Yaz) for a few years (on birth control since age 14 due to ovarian cysts), and just this past month started Lo LoEstrin Fe. I am in a monogamous relationship but have had multiple sexual partners over the years. I drink about 100-200 oz of water a day (I am ALWAYS thirsty and have been checked for diabetes as it runs in my family- negative). My urine is usually very pale or clear. I eat a mostly vegetarian diet but have meat a few times a month. Beef maybe every six weeks. \n\nSo for the past 6-8 months I've noticed that in the days before my period, my urine has seemed concentrated and has a distinct odor. It's almost meaty (I feel so disgusting saying that). It smells like overcooked, burnt meat. It burns slighty when I pee, especially first thing in the morning or if I've been holding it in for a while. I had my yearly exam in January and my pap was \"abnormal\" - my cervix appeared irritated and I was positive for HPV. The entire concentrated/smelly/burning pee goes away within a day or two of getting my period.\n\nBasically I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this... I'm going back to my gyno for a colposcopy in early March, but I'm seeing a partner (not my regular doctor) and feel a little self conscious bringing this up. Any input is greatly appreciated!  PLEASE ASK THE DOC. The doctor has heard it all before! And if he or she hasn't, you could get a paper written about your brand new condition! ",

I feel like he is \"blocked\" and I have severe discomfort. This is causing me extreme anxiety. I am not sure what is wrong. My legs shakes uncontrollably and I feel like something is going to rip. Can it be vaginismus? or I have too thick of a hymen? We use lube each time and take it slow. I cant even express how much anxiety and sadness this is causing me. I love him and want to make love with him but I can't and I feel broken. I feel like nothing is working.      ",

    "title" : "Just cancelled my Weight Watchers subscription",
    "snippet" : "Reaching my goal weight wasn't the reason for my cancellation.  In fact, I haven't lost more than a few pounds even while sticking to the plan.  On or off, my weight just doesn't budge more than +/- 5 pounds.  \n\n\nBut the program not working for me isn't why I really cancelled.  I decided that I don't need to do it.  I don't want to be on a diet forever.  I don't want to have one extra thing to worry about when there's already enough on my mind.  Big deal if I'm a size 12 and in the overweight category.  My cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar are all perfectly normal, nowhere near the point where I need to worry.  My body is capable of running around with my kids, long walks, long bike rides, yoga, all the physical things I enjoy.\n\n\nI don't want my kids (daughter especially) seeing me constantly struggle against where my body naturally lands.  Why keep fighting it if all it does is stress me out?  Sure, I'll have days where all I see are the flaws in the mirror.  But I'm going to make it a point to see the awesome stuff more often, like how good I look in a pencil skirt.  I think I got all caught up in it because it seems like that's just what (many) women do.  Forget that.  I'm an overall confident person.  It's time to be true to me and stop trying to fit some \"ideal\" norm.  I'm not 18, I'll never be a size 6 again and that's ok!\n\n\nThanks for reading.  Had to get it off my chest somewhere.\n\n\n**edit** I wanted to clarify something in my post.  I'm active.  I eat well.  I love to cook so our family doesn't eat a diet consisting of convenience meals.  We eat a ton of fruits and vegetables (vegetarian meals about half the time).  Treats?  Sure, but not in excess.  My original point was that if I'm already physically healthy, why am I making my mental health suffer by beating myself up because I'm not meeting a societal norm of beauty as portrayed by media?  \n\n\nGood bp, cholesterol, etc now doesn't mean you say screw it and start eating tons of junk and stop moving.  I think it means keep on keeping on and make changes if/when medically necessary.  For example, I have PCOS.  I have to keep my blood sugar in check.  It was never too high and still within normal but I made some tweaks over the last six months to ensure long term health (simple as adding things like whole grain pasta vs regular, trying new things like quinoa and tofu in place of rice or meat) and my doctor is fine with where I am but will monitor each year to be on the safe side.  She's not pushing x amount of weight loss, though, so it's not a concern of hers and now not of mine at the moment.\n\n\nMy goal?  Love myself the way I am, keep taking care of my body so I can do the things I love, and teach this to my kids.  I think the fundamental difference between those who don't like it, and those who do hinges on the idea that WW is *not* a diet. It's supposed to be a positive lifestyle change. If you think WW is a diet, then it's drudgery.\n\nYeah, I'm on WW. It's not a good idea for everybody. But I like it because it makes me mindful of portion sizes. When I stick to the plan (exercising, tracking my points etc.), I lose weight. I'm not ideal, though. I go off plan and eat too much. When I do, then I gain weight. It's not rocket surgery, but if it was easy to eat right all the time, then it would be hard to become obese.\n\nWW isn't about starving to death or weird fad eating. If it's not what you need or not right for you, that's fine. But if it is the thing you need to keep on track, then it's a good framework for developing and maintaining healthy habits. This is true of any diet. People who pick the \"1 week diet\" fads are just going to yoyo (and cause health problems due to the stress on their bodies).\n\nAnyone looking to lose weight needs to approach it as a lifestyle change, and that needs to be something they can stick to. That is why I don't do keto. I can reduce carbs, but not that much. I love cookies too much.\n\nAnd as long as that person is happy and healthy, I think and body changes at that point are more like icing on the cake.

I know it is something that works for a lot of people.  I'm more excited about this lightbulb that went off in my head that I don't *need* to lose weight.  I'm perfectly fine as I am and have decided I'm happy with that.  The mental weight that has been lifted is making me far happier than telling myself I need to lose weight and feeling like a failure. And I agree, that is the important decision we need to make about ourselves. As long as you are healthy and comfortable in your skin, then that's what matters.\n\n I stay on plan because I am not that far from goal, and I really would like to get there. In your own way, *you already made it to goal*. I know it is something that works for a lot of people.

I don't NEED to lose weight either, but god damnit if I don't feel better in my size 8s than I do in my size 12s.  Why in the world would this get downvoted?!  I feel better in my 8's too!!! Go you!!!  Its hard to take care of this body and sometimes I struggle with it, but I hate how I feel when I'm in a size 12.  I am self-conscious and feel totally uncomfortable.  Why is this unpopular when the reverse is okay?  \n\nSometimes, this sub makes ZERO sense.  \n\nHealth.  Health is what is important.  And when you are in your 20s, 30s and even 40s being overweight might not be a terrible thing.  But being overweight in your 50s and above is an entirely different thing.  The human body was NOT made to carry around a significant amount of extra weight.  I realize this is not politically correct, but it is science and it is true.  \n\n I completely understand your point and basicslly agree, butI'd actually say the reverse maybe even more true. Being overweight as a teenager or a twenty something is a huge red flag, because it means you are much more likely to continue gaining weight as you age. It's completely normal to put on a few pounds in your 40s and 50s due to your metabolism slowing down and hormonal changes, but putting on those extra pounds early means your much more likely to be severely overweight as you age. Even in previous generations it wasn't unusual for people to put on some weight during their middle aged years, but extremely overweight children and twenty somethings is a completely new phenomenon. If you only start putting on weight in your late 40s, then there is much less time to actuwlly become obese. \n\nThis is why it's so critical we devote serious resources to fighting childhood obesity, because the statistics show someone who's obese in their younger years is incredibly more likely to develop things like type 2 diabetes later on. Bad habits that are started early are incredibly hard to break.  I think the fundamental difference between those who don't like it, and those who do hinges on the idea that WW is *not* a diet.

If it's not what you need or not right for you, that's fine. But if it is the thing you need to keep on track, then it's a good framework for developing and maintaining healthy habits. I came here to say basically this. Body acceptance and being healthy is great, which I commend OP for. but I didn't really like seeing WW referred to as a \"diet.\" I've been on WW for about eight months now and it is not a diet at all. It's about portion control and making healthier choices. It's a lifestyle. I've stuck to the plan and I try and make healthy[er] choices with all of my food. This is for life, this is not some passing fad diet I will someday give up when my goal is reached. MY fiance is doing the plan with me and we have both lost about 40lbs each. I have never felt better in my life. \n\nWeight Watchers isn't for everyone, and that is understandable, but calling it a \"diet\" attaches a stigma to it that I think is very unfair.

I agree that WW can be really great and helpful, but for someone my size (140ish lbs.), it is so, so difficult to eat 1200 calories a day (or less if you don't gorge yourself on fruits and vegetables). I think that's why I've struggled so much with the program...when I do it, I feel good about myself. But it's because I have a sick sort of control over my eating, not because I feel I'm really doing things right : / it's not easy to stick to 1200 calories a day at ANY size. in fact, it sucks balls. I understand that. It's just very frustrating to me that someone my size and someone who weighs 110 or 120 pounds get the same number of points in the WW system! Also, with the way the system works, I end up having to eat about 250 or more calories of fruits and vegetables per day just to hit the 1200 mark. That's a lot of broccoli. I weigh 128 and want to get down to 120 and eating the full 1200 calories a day is difficult for me actually. I get very full very fast, so portion control is easy.  I'm the opposite. Eating in the morning makes me hungrier, and half my points are gone by noon (I get up at 6:30) just to keep myself from starving. And 13 points for the rest of the day is not enough when I have a good 12 hours left! : ( I understand that.

I weigh almost 30 lb less than that, and while I don't track my calories regularly, I know I eat at the very, very least 2,000 calories a day. \n\nI think that most people will definitely lose weight if they stick to a starvation diet, but a lot of it will be muscle. I think I also have a very slow metabolism, which doesn't help. My boyfriend weighs 125 pounds and eats way, way more than I do D: It definitely seems that there's a genetic component to metabolism, and to body shape/size. I can even see that just in my own family-- we all eat whatever we want, and at 5'3\" and 112 lb, I'm one of the largest-sized women in my entire extended family. And it's a lifelong thing; my grandpa is 96 and wears the same size clothing he wore as a teenager, for example. I really think it's largely genetics.

I have a friend who is a personal trainer and is an advocate of \"Health at Any Size,\" which essentially is a philosophy that as long as you are putting good things into your body and are active, fit and healthy by nearly every other metric, what you weigh is not particularly important. And that is true to an extent--there are health risks associated with being overweight, but there are plenty of \"skinnyfat\" people who look thin but are in *terrible* health because they don't exercise and/or eat like shit.\n\nIf OP has good stats, and her weight isn't causing issues like sleep apnea or anything, I wouldn't worry about her. Hell she says she does yoga and hikes and stuff. She's probably in pretty good health.\n\nAnd seriously...

I was actually slightly under my ideal weight for my height and wearing a size 0, and everyone told me it was so awesome that I wore a size 0, and I was pretty damn proud of that fact.\n\nBut my diet consisted mainly of french fries and pizza and I couldn't do a single push-up or run a mile without stopping to wheeze 30 seconds in.\n\nThankfully I realized that being 90 pounds and a size 0 wasn't what mattered most, my health mattered most. Now I'm ~~20~~ 30 pounds heavier and two jeans sizes larger, but I'm going for a 5 mile run tonight and my lunch consists of a tasty salad and soup. And honestly, I feel SO much better in my body now. I hate how a lot of people/society/the ever-influential powers that be put so much emphasis on numbers like weight and clothing size instead of focusing on overall general health. I'm just glad I came to that realization when I had the time, energy, and metabolism to get my butt in gear.

It's like having light skin doesn't give you skin cancer; it just makes you get it faster than a darker-skinned person if you both get tons of sun exposure.    [deleted] If by work you mean causing people to lose weight, then I'm afraid you are mistaken.\n\nWeight Watchers, which is all about branding itself as a \"lifestyle change\" these days, has [a success rate of about 0.24%](http://fatfu.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/weight-watchers/), and even that is composed almost entirely of people who were no more than 5-10 pounds over their goal weight when they started.\n\nOf course, if by \"lifestyle change\" you meant realizations like the OP's that you can just stop worrying about your weight and get on with your life, then you're quite right. Those work very well indeed.\n [deleted] And a \"lifestyle change\" could be a complete overhaul of what you eat.  But labelling something a \"diet\" makes it feel temporary, which doesn't work in terms of keeping weight off. [deleted] [deleted] &gt;I mean lifestyle change as in cutting down fizzy drink, cutting out fast food, those kind of lifestyle changes. They work.\n\nWhat's your definition of \"work\"?\n\nPlenty of overweight and obese people (raises hand) never eat fast food, eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies, drink water instead of caloric drinks, etc. The pounds don't magically disappear.\n\nI can't count how many doctors have advised me to quit doing these things I haven't done for YEARS, because they look at BMI and assume I'm stuffing my face at McDonald's. Then they look at my HDL and LDL, my blood pressure, my glucose... and sound all pleasantly surprised that I'm actually clinically healthy, in spite of being over the \"magic number\" on one of their criteria.

Maybe you should fit in some exercise? Lifting works wonders. The only thing I have time to lift is my four-year-old (and occasionally eight-year-old). \n\nI walk whenever I can (at least 1-2 times a week), take the stairs up if it's fourth floor or lower, etc. but I can't run/jog (without risking serious re-injury to either knee or my back), and now and then (about once a month) do more strenuous activities like a family hike or a major house project. \n\nBut by the time the kids are in bed, it's 8:30, I'm completely wiped out, and simply don't have the energy to get myself up and go to the gym. :-/  I often still have work to do that I couldn't finish during the day because I have to leave at 4:00 to relieve childcare. Getting up early isn't an option; I did that for a while, but it seriously affected my health, because I can't get to sleep any earlier (very hardwired body clock). Gym doesn't have childcare, and I have to make dinner when I get off work anyway.  4:00-4:30 drive home; 4:30 - 6:30 help with homework, address other kid needs, make dinner; 6:30-7 eat dinner; 7-8 finish up homework, socialize with family, maybe take a walk if the weather's nice; 8:00-8:30 put kids to bed; and that's when the first chance I have for adult conversation or activities with my husband happens. Bills, household decisions, budgeting, etc. Oh, and we're trying to start a couple small businesses too, which gets squeezed into that two hours a day.\n\nWeekends are for birthday parties, special school projects, cultural enrichment activities, family visits (some grandparent always wants some time with the kids, and there's only one of them we can leave alone with them), meal planning and shopping (at least we walk to the farmer's market and grocery store), getting ahead on cooking prep, and other special household projects. Oh, and maintaining the fish tank, trying to grow some food in the garden, stuff like that.\n\nWorking hard, or hardly working? People call it excuses, but for me, it's life. I squeeze in what I can. If I could stay in Phase II sleep for more than a minute at a time, that would help, but I can't... and no doctor seems to think this is a problem that it's their job to help me solve. :-/ The CPAP and the drugs didn't work, so they're stumped and they're done. Jesus I wasn't asking for your life story  Allow me to recommend /r/BodyAcceptance .\n\nIt deals with many issues, but a common theme is your own epiphany: getting past obsessing about ones appearance, and getting on with living one's life.\n\n  As a daughter, thank you!!! I watched my mom try every diet when I was a kid, and now there are a bunch of foods that I'm totally uncomfortable eating. I can't stand pasta or bread, not because I don't like them, but because eating them makes me feel guilty. And she never ever criticized me for how I are!

I think it's awesome that you've come to this realization, but I would like to remind you (and everyone in general) that just because your numbers are good now doesn't necessarily mean they will be in the future, and nobody should give up on living a healthy lifestyle because they are fine with how they look and their bp is within range for now.\n\n***not implying that you were planning on giving up, just a reminder because I see good numbers given as an excuse to quit a lot*** I think it's awesome that you've come to this realization, but I would like to remind you (and everyone in general) that just because your numbers are good now doesn't necessarily mean they will be in the future, and nobody should give up on living a healthy lifestyle because they are fine with how they look and their bp is within range for now.\n\n***not implying that you were planning on giving up, just a reminder because I see good numbers given as an excuse to quit a lot*** Ah, the good old [Vague Future Health Threat](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22vague+future+health+threat%22).\n\n  THANK YOU for being a good role model for your children!  More kids need to know that being healthy and staying active are important, being thin is not.  Keep it up! :D  Well done for you, that's a great way of thinking.\n\nAlso, say what you may about WW, those chocolate rice krispy snack bars they sell are like crack. They make a mini cream filled red velvet cake for 2 PP. I told myself no more \"fake\" food... I made an exception ;) They are so delicious!      I really connected to this because as long as I can remember my mom has been obsessed with losing weight. She's been on every diet, every crazy fad, she has all the books on her shelf and right now she is doing this crazy one where she eats little and has to get shots (that I assume) are vitamins so she has energy to go about her day. She has done WW too.\n\nAnd the crazy thing is she isn't even big. She is a size 12 too and has been that way for as long as I can remember. She is healthy too, she grew up playing sports her whole life and can do all the things you described above. Her cholesterol is much better than my dad's who is skinny.\n\nI definitely have a distorted perception of my body which probably came from her and my father who definitely encouraged this behaviour. It is hard to get away from worrying about my weight since it has such a big presence and emphasis on my life growing up. I am glad you realized that this might affect your daughter.       That's amazing for you to be able to balance all these things out :) I don't want to give you parenting advice, because it's none of my business, but I just want to tell you that I hope you make sure your children eat well and have an healthy lifestyle. Not because they should care about their physical appearance and weight, but because until they are old enough to take care of their health and have control on their own habits, it's your job to make them feel \"good\" about their bodies.\n\nI have to speak for myself, but even with the great talks my mom would give me about loving myself and my body, I grew up being overweight and it definitely affected my body image. My mom always gave me a second slice of cake and I didn't do any sports. Even though now I understand that my weight  doesn't define me, I went through some pretty bad periods of my life and  sometimes I wish I was thin because it was my mom's responsibility when I was younger.\n\nSo yeah I didn't want to tell you what to do, just a little something to thing about ;)     This is why I tell people that my Paleo Diet isn't really a *diet*. It changed the way I look at food and what nutritionally is better for me to eat. It's not about counting calories. To me it's about cutting out the junk that has somehow been accepted as edible food. Sure, it's more expensive and sure it takes me twice as long at the grocery store because I read the ingredients on *everything*. But I *feel* better. And now that I'm not used to them anymore, heavily salted/greasy/sweet things don't taste good anymore. They're overwhelming and make me sick (I can't eat pizza anymore; I feel sluggish after eating it). [deleted] No, I mean like junk. Chips are tasty, but pointless. And there's so many chemicals in a simple Lean Cuisine, that's no longer real food in my opinion. My dieting habits in the past may have been effective at weight loss, but they certainly weren't healthy. All the things you listed are great, and I will partake in said foods occasionally. [deleted] [deleted] Whole grain bread is not \"healthy\".   God I hate health nuts. I hate comments like this. As a third party viewer neither of you have given points to back up your statements. A) Whole grain bread is healthy and B) Whole Grain bread is unhealthy. \n\nThat's like saying nothing.\n\nWhat's the point? Alright, this is what I mean. I often see blanket statements on the Internet saying \"whole grains are unhealthy,\" and that just rubs me the wrong way. We can't even eat whole grains now because they are \"unhealthy?\"\n\nI've seen whole grains being compared to fatty foods and desserts. They're not that bad. Grains are essential to the diet of many cultures and saying that people who eat grains are eating unhealthily annoys me.\n\nIf you dislike grains, fine, but don't go around telling everyone they are unhealthy, and thus, insinuating that people who eat grains have an unhealthy diet. For example, I'm Asian, and I eat a lot of rice because it's part of my culture. Don't go around telling me that I'm killing myself by eating grains. \n\nAnd that's what I meant about being a health nut. People who go completely overboard and try to spread their views to others. It's like the militant vegetarians. It's annoying. People eat differently from you, big deal.  Thank you! I love your response. I completely agree. I do a strict keto diet, and I have no fabrications that grain is unhealthy, it's culturally relative in my opinion. My SO is from Burma and eats large amounts of noodles and rice. He is quite healthy, but there's NO freaking way I could eat the same diet. I would be sick, lethargic, and gain weight. People evolved on eating different foods around the world. \n\nI've always thought that people should consider their roots more when deciding what foods might be best for them. \n\nJust because a food has been linked to a bad effect, doesn't make that food bad. For instance, if something causes high blood pressure, is it so bad for someone with a history of low blood pressure to consume? It could actually be beneficial.\n\nI think people need to take a less black and white view of things as well. \n\nThank you for sharing.  No, I mean like junk. Chips are tasty, but pointless. And there's so many chemicals in a simple Lean Cuisine, that's no longer real food in my opinion. My dieting habits in the past may have been effective at weight loss, but they certainly weren't healthy. All the things you listed are great, and I will partake in said foods occasionally. You do realize there's a middle ground between chowing down on potato chips and preservative-filled frozen meals 24/7, and eliminating a huge percentage of natural and healthy foods, right?\n\nThere are many problems with the \"paleo\" diet, but here's a big one: it is pseudoscience. It ignores (among many other things) the fact that evolution isn't a process whereby a species pops into existence and then magically stays the same forever. Humans have continued to evolve since paleolithic times, and we have adapted to our surroundings just as other species have-- including adapting to food products that are agriculturally-cultivated. Anyone who doesn't believe this should take a college-level course in human evolution. [deleted] This is why I tell people that my Paleo Diet isn't really a *diet*. It changed the way I look at food and what nutritionally is better for me to eat. It's not about counting calories.

And now that I'm not used to them anymore, heavily salted/greasy/sweet things don't taste good anymore. They're overwhelming and make me sick (I can't eat pizza anymore; I feel sluggish after eating it). Except there are several problems with the Paleo diet.\n\n* High intake of iron\n* High intake of bad amino acids such as tryptophan\n* Low-carb intake, although this seems to be dependent on which Paleo school is being referred to.\n\nBest thing I ever did was to stop Paleo. It took me from a metabolic problems to a metabolic nose dive. I am grateful that I survived that little stupid experiment. I am apparently also not alone in this as I see a lot of ex-paleo people in diet recovery groups(180 degree health, Danny Roddy, and so on).\n\nPaleo is like Christianity: it tends to believe evolution is some bullshit and that we haven't evolved since time immemorial.  That's great :) \n\nI don't think that being overweight is automatically unhealthy, a lot of studies these days are finding that mortality is actually lower for overweight people than 'normal weight' people. (eg. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1555137) This study is based on BMI. BMI is a poor indicator of overall health... and was never meant to be used as an indicator of fatness.\n\nSource: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106268439\n\n&gt;It is scientifically nonsensical.\nThere is no physiological reason to square a person's height (Quetelet had to square the height to get a formula that matched the overall data. If you can't fix the data, rig the formula!). Moreover, it ignores waist size, which is a clear indicator of obesity level.\n\n&gt;It is physiologically wrong.\nIt makes no allowance for the relative proportions of bone, muscle and fat in the body. But bone is denser than muscle and twice as dense as fat, so a person with strong bones, good muscle tone and low fat will have a high BMI. Thus, athletes and fit, health-conscious movie stars who work out a lot tend to find themselves classified as overweight or even obese.\n  There *is* no such thing as being overweight - but there is such a thing as unhealthy.  Weight is just one measurement, along with cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, body fat %, etc. of \"measuring\" health.  \n\nI'm so glad you're putting effort into being healthy and taking care of yourself.    Good for you!  I'm roughly 5'8 and a size 14, all hips/thighs/booty - and while I'm overweight, I try and eat right, and I exercise.  I just get bummed out when my doctor tells me I should be losing weight.  She's like 5'11 and 150 lb and in her 60s.  Ugh.  My levels are all fine, what's the big deal! Playing devil's advocate here just to clarify her concern- body fat isn't always as visible as you'd think. If you're considered \"overweight\" then you also have excess fat on your organs, which is what physicians are primarily concerned about. However, if you truly eat right and exercise your risk for health issues down the road is decreased.\n\nIf you're doc really gets on your case about it, try looking for an internist who focuses on preventative medicine as well. That type of doc is going to be more concerned with your overall health and won't be as quick to focus on your weight alone. Thank you for the suggestion!  I remember being 160 lb in high school, the higher limit of my healthy BMI and I looked scrawny and was still a size 12.  Like I said, all in my booty.  My waist is about 32\", last I checked.  I think maybe I'll just stick to what I am doing and add in some more weight lifting and see if that brings me down a bit. ;)  It might be worthwhile to change up the routine as I get into my 30s haha  Stick to cardio if you want the weight to come off, and measure yourself so you can see where it's shedding. You can't target it, so better to see what your body wants to do first. You could inadvertently make your booty bigger by building up the muscle and not burning the fat. Although, if you want a bigger booty that would be a great idea! :P \n I think you're getting down voted because you are giving bad advice. Cardio is good for the heart, but after awhile you will stop losing weight with cardio alone, as your metabolism adjusts. Building the muscle, then working the muscle with cardio yields fat loss even after cardio stops doing the trick.       I have been struggling with my own version of this dilemma. I was with you until you said something to the effect of...at least I'm not an 18! \n\nI am a 14/16 and it kills me to know I am apparently so close to a shameful size. Back to the gym I go I guess. But that's not what I said at all...I'm not what the media portrays as desirable in mainstream US.  Many women don't fit that picture and that's ok.  It's the confidence that makes someone desirable, not the size.  That was my point.  I'm not going to stress myself and hate what I am when I am healthy just because I don't fit into these socially constructed box.  You, and every other woman out there of any shape or size, deserve the same.  It seriously was a freeing moment to let go of that burden.  Your relationship with your body sounds like it's pretty healthy - but since you are \"recovering\" from restricting your body in a dietary way, I would highly recommend researching Intuitive Eating, the \"non-diet\" approach, the hunger scale, and Dr. Jenn Berman's \"No More Diets\" program.  These are all about repairing your relationship with food, after having a diet mentality for so long.  The gist is that the rebellion following food restriction is a healthy response to something unhealthy (restricting food instead of listening to your body's cues), and these all focus on how to learn to \"hear\" your body again after so long only listening to the scale, the calorie count, etc.\n\nI recommend them because, while you seem like you have a good grasp of how your body feels, it is not uncommon for people who decide to start listening to their body to temporarily gain weight while they learn how to put dietary restrictions behind them, and I don't want you to be discouraged and return to diets if that happens.      If you DO want to lose weight - for YOU, not for any norm - ditch the diets and just start eating real food.  Learn to cook, even if it's just really basic stuff, and ditch eating food that comes out of a box.  Cut down on snacks and cakes and the like, maybe just one or two smaller ones a day. You'll be surprised at how some of the weight just comes off. What part of the post makes you think that the OP doesn't do this? The part where she signed up for a very restrictive diet plan that gives points to different brands of prepackaged food.\n\nI know lots of people go for that sort of stuff for convenience, too.  I think it's the rule rather than the exception.     [deleted]",

    "snippet" : "Hi ladies, this is my first post here, and I have subscribed and LOVED how much support and love you all give and have here. I'd like to share my dilemma with you in hopes that you have the experience and knowledge to help me out.\n\nI have been shaving down there since I was 16 (I'm 23 now) and have cut myself, given myself bumps, redness, irritation, etc ever since. Instead of the pretty, smooth and non blemished skin I see in pictures and porn, I'm left with an angry red bumpy mass. I shave about every 3 weeks, because I get razor burn like a mother if I shave anytime before then. My boyfriend doesn't care whether I shave or not, but I like to shave because of *coughs* smells that linger down there. Anyway, I have been thinking about waxing down there just for the sake of a) getting it done because hey! there's a first for everything, right? and b) having a smooth area down there and c) I don't have to worry about shaving every three weeks and morphing myself into an acrobat just to see down there to get all the hairs in the tub.\n\nSo, here are my questions:\n\n* How many of you wax vs shave?\n* What do you prefer?\n* Are there any tips you can give me for having a cleaner shaved area, or am I doing something seriously wrong?\n* What about home waxing kits?\n* How much does it normally cost to maintain a waxed area?\n* On a pain scale of an orgasm to being actively mauled by a bear, how bad does waxing down there feel?\n\nThank you in advance for your responses. I can't wait to hear from you all!\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your responses! :) I have called around and found a well reputed waxer and will set up an appointment for sometime next week. Until then, exfoliations and proper care down there will do nicely. :) Thank you all for your help!        ",

    "snippet" : "I need them to take me away from the household IMMEDIATELY after I call. If not, it could end up being my death sentence so calling would be pointless.      I agree that CPS will not help. They were called on my parents, with no results. My parents abused me for years and I felt I would never escape. That being said- go to a teacher, professor, friend, etc who is well off and will give you a place to stay. Do NOT give up hope. What he is doing is WRONG and staying there won't be easier than getting out. Please ask someone you trust for help or stay at a shelter. \n\nI wish I lived closer because I'd give you a place to stay in a heartbeat- I've been there and done that. And the only way it got better was when I left and lived with someone safe AND got counselling!\n\nEdit: don't go to teachers. Go to someone you trust who you can stay with. But don't stay in this situation. It's not okay, and will only get worse, like you said. Teachers would lose their jobs for taking in a student like that, and we're mandatory reporters -- meaning they'd have to call CPS immediately or be committing a crime themselves. My bad.

Calling CPS will just get my dad to beat me even harder and more frequently. The CPS option is pointless. I want to kill myself. There is no escape. For anyone wanting to argue with me, read up on stories on how kids my age have been screwed over by the system. There's always an escape. Next time he isn't paying attention, run. Just fucking run. Go to a friends house, or a church, or a bettered women's shelter, or a police station, or *something* - discovering one pointless option doesn't mean you dont have others you can explore.

Do you have family or friends close by who you can stay with? No. No. No.    I work for social services in my state. Find out if your state has an abuse hotline for your state social services agency.\n\nBefore you call, document your situation. If you have marks, cuts, scars, or broken bones, take photos with the date visible. Get historical records together like hospital bills. You need to be able to show the investigator on the first visit that you are not safe and that this is a pattern of violent behavior.\n\nWhen you call, you need to make specific allegations, not blanket statements. \"he punched me on Tuesday and left a bruise on my chest\" is totally different from \"he hits me all the time.\"\n\nYou need to tell then that you would like to report Physical Abuse, Inadequate Supervision, Family Violence Threatens The Child (if there's anyone else being hurt), Bizarre Punishment (if you're being punished with beatings or deprivation like being shoved in a closet), and Substance Abuse (if that's happening).\n\nThose categories are federally-defined maltreatment codes that trigger investigations. Make it clear that you feel that continuing to reside in the house places you in physical danger. When the investigator comes, make it clear that you believe that and have proof.\n\nUnless the investigator is a root vegetable, this should be enough to trigger the immediate removal of all children in the home.

Some toddlers are completely capable of disappearing in seconds on their own.\n\nWhat I found completely insane was that the mailman just let her walk past him and didn't even lift a finger to stop her. Just pointed her dad in her direction when he came around the corner looking for her. My friend has a little girl who simply walked out of their apartment so she could go to the pool at 2 years old.

That's what happened in my case, a neighbor just watched it happen and flagged down police instead of coming directly to me, knowing it was my kid.  :\\  People are terrified to help other people's kids nowadays, must be such a liability. Did you mistype? You said your son was 2. \n\nI just find it hard to believe that a two year old can escape looking for a slurpee (and that the caseworker would be able to discuss it with him).  Call the police first and foremost. Keep a log of everything that happens to you. Take pictures if you can.\n\nTalk to your teachers at school. They may be able to help you.             ",

    "title" : "Thoughts on male roommate?",
    "snippet" : "I am planning out my housing for next year and one of my friends is willing to room with me. I don't know him really well but he's definitely focused on his academics and we get along whenever we do hang out. \n\nWe're thinking of doing either separate bedrooms, but in a one bedroom format (so someone gets the living room and the other person gets a bedroom) but he's also willing to live in a studio with me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts/experiences on this?\n\nedit: Some basic background on us. I'm 20 and so is he. We're both uni students, bio major, in our 2nd year.   Get separate bedrooms (I recommend this for everyone regardless of gender of roommate) Beyond that it should be fine. I personally can't live with most women but have never had a problem with male roomies.  I've had the same thought, but I think in my case it comes down to the fact that any male roommates in uni were fellow geeks and math/science people, while any females I happened to live with were arts majors with much different interests. I think interests had a lot more to do with it than gender. Nah I lived in a house that was like 90% comp sci including the women (it was a weird dept almost 40% of the ungrad comp sci majors were women) and still prefer living with men.  That's awesome there were so many women in your degree! When my boyfriend did computer science there were none.  He was at an engineering school right? We were really unique I've never heard of another program that had our numbers. I've had the same thought, but I think in my case it comes down to the fact that any male roommates in uni were fellow geeks and math/science people, while any females I happened to live with were arts majors with much different interests. I think interests had a lot more to do with it than gender. So if my potential roommate had the exact same major/anticipated schedule as me, you wouldn't advice it then? Get separate bedrooms (I recommend this for everyone regardless of gender of roommate) Beyond that it should be fine. I personally can't live with most women but have never had a problem with male roomies.   GET YOUR OWN BEDROOM. It will be awkward if you don't because you will eventually wind up doing something you regret with either a) your roommate, which will make living together awkward, or b) someone else, whom your roommate will hear/see you with, which will make living together awkward. If that's not enough of a reason to get your own room, do it so you have your own space to go to/decorate how you please/keep your things organized as you please. \n\nRoom situation aside -- I live with four guys: my boyfriend, his best friend from childhood, their old roommate, and a random-ish roommate we didn't really know before move-in. It's great for the most part but it can be occasionally frustrating because five people use the dishes/kitchen/bathroom/etc. so chores need to be done frequently and we all have a different idea of what \"frequently\" means. That would probably be a problem with five people of any gender though, I don't think it's necessarily worse because four of the people who live here are guys.  That's what I've faced this year in a studio heh. It got awkward when my roommate brought home a guy and they were having drunk shenanigans going on in her bed. Have you experienced living in a studio with another person? I haven't heard any success stories or had any, so I'm kind of getting desperate by being willing to pay for my own bedroom.    XY here:  I've lived in \"shared housing\" (separate bedrooms) with mixed genders just fine with zero sexual tension.  I also lived in a studio with a woman before, and we ended up sleeping together three months into it.  It's just too easy to \"just snuggle\" when there is only one bedroom. That sounds pretty awkward. How was spending the rest of the lease with her then after ending up sleeping together?      I live with NINE MEN! \n\nSeparate bedrooms, shared enormous common room, 3 bathrooms between all of us. It's wonderful. They don't flush the toilet after they pee though. BE WARNED\n\nHave dealt with a couple brief gender-related issues--a roommate made some sort of crude comment concerning titties at which I retreated to my bedroom, but I talked to him about it after and made him understand why I found it upsetting / etc and everything has been super dandy. There was one other issue where I heard rumors that I was topless all the time in the common room and got pissy at them for presumably spreading these rumors, but this was all resolved in the end. Being upfront about issues is key! Seriously, deal with them immediately and plainly. I miss being able to borrow clothes from when I had female roommates, but it's OK :)  Holy eff, you're brave. I couldn't handle living with that many people no matter what the gender mix is. Random question -- how many fridges in the kitchen does that require?!

I miss being able to borrow clothes from when I had female roommates, but it's OK :)  That's impressive that you live with nine men... I can't even imagine that. Sounds a lot easier than nine women though, I don't know how nine women would share only three bathrooms. So do you prefer that over living with women then, or would you say gender even mattered? Last year I lived with 2 women (we all shared 1 bathroom) and liked that very much, too. I was closer with them--not sure if that's a gender-related, number-of-roommates-related, or just person-related thing--so the dynamic was very different, but I wouldn't say any more or less enjoyable. Lacking that closeness with my current male roommates is not a problem, like I still have a lot of fun with them, though it's sometimes an issue in unexpected ways--for example, earlier this year I broke up with a guy I was seeing and he decided to come into my room unbeknownst to me, clean all my shit, do all my laundry, leave me post-its and apology pizza all over the place... and my roommates let him in!! Apparently he was just like \"derp I'm her boyfriend\" and my roommates were like \"hmm we've never heard her talk about a boyfriend... but he has pizza... if we let him in, we let in the pizza :D\" &gt;___&gt;;. That could never have happened last year because my awesome female roommates would have been the first people I told about my romantic failures haha.\n\n(I have since informed my roommates that if someone tries to come into my room claiming to be my boyfriend, he is most likely trying to kill me, so we ultimately resolved this unexpected issue too haha =])      How old are you? Do you get drunk regularly? Most male/female roommates in their 20's tend to hook up eventually if alcohol is involved. That generally leads to all kinds of awkwardness.   ",

I'm sitting there thinking it's a waste of time, thinking I already know all this stuff, and for some reason, my brain keeps flashing back to the first time I had a sexual encounter two years ago. There had always been something icky about it in my mind. I didn't find this guy attractive, but I got really drunk and ended up giving him oral sex. But during this seminar, I realized that it was more than just icky. It was rape. He got me drunk, then got me back to his room under the pretense of \"watching a movie.\" He told me to go down on him. I had said no. I had actually forgotten that part in all my shame and regret and self-loathing, but I said no, and he pushed my head down. \n\nAnyway, now this idea is just floating around in my head and I can't stop thinking about it.

I just got my period a week and a half after my last one ended.. and its got me freaked out, cant get into the gyno till monday.  \n\n27 year old right here, and ever since i can remember my period is like clockwork. always on time, always quite consistent.  This new change to my body has got me quite worried and I would love to hear from you ladies instead of worrying myself over pages and pages on forums.  I know either way nothing will be resolved till I can get into the clinic.  \n\nbit of my background which I know or atleast deserve some lecturing on anyways, but, thats not the point.  I have been back in school for the past 7 weeks in quite a stressful program. I drink, am a regular stoner, do the occasional drugs (recently mdma &amp; lsd), and unfortunetly still smoke them cigarettes.  I've been sleeping with the same guy for the past 5 months, we use condoms but not during the whole process if you catch my drift (a habit ive been doing my whole sex life and i need to fucking stop). we are both clean. my diet is not the healthiest, not the worst either, but i know i could really use more fruits and veggies in my diet so i question if my semi-malnutritioned diet is somewhat to blame.  I havnt been to the gyno in three years either.  Obviously there is so much about my life i need to change and whatever is going on inside me has given me the urge to get all this risky behavior in check. \nany thoughts or healing vibes would be very appreciated.     There are a lot of things that can cause a screwed up period that are inocuous. Stress, bad nutrition (which you mentioned), and once in my own case, I had a lighter period followed by another one soon after cause my body didn't properly expel all of the old lining.\n\nDefinitely check with your gyno, but hopefully, it is one of the innocuous causes.

As a girl in an engineering field, most of my friends are guys. Most of his friends are girls. Of those best friend girls, one he dated for a few months. They are quite close friends now and he's said that he doesn't look at her that way. They still do a thing that they used to do when they date. I'm not too terribly concerned about that. I think I trust him when he says he's not into her any more, they just have a weird relationship now. \n\nI feel like I'm being judged though.

    "snippet" : "I know I've often felt like I needed more friends in my life, especially when I moved to a new state just a little over a year and a half ago. I also didn't really know anyone at all when I first moved here. Being an introvert (and having social anxiety) definitely made it harder to meet and connect with people. I've only made one good friend here, and just recently have been able to develop another closer/deeper friendship with someone else.\n\nI just went through a breakup (wasn't a bad breakup, so I'm not heartbroken now or anything), and it hit me just how awesome of a support system I do have in my life. I may not have a lot of friends, but the friends I do have are amazing. I mean, I've always known my friends were great, but I've never really tested the relationship so to speak. To elaborate more since I'm not sure I convey it how I wanted to- I've never had problems being there for them, but I've never really reached out to them when I needed help (either never had the opportunity or just wasn't willing to at the time). Even though most of my friends aren't close by (different states/different time zones), and I can go months without talking to them... when I do need them, they're there for me. As I've discovered this time when I reached out to them to talk about my breakup. (And of course, it goes without saying, I'm totally willing to be there for them as well.) I think this is a very important realization for me, especially now.\n\nAs of late, I've been putting extra pressure on myself to go out and meet new people in my area, and thinking about how I need to build a better support system for myself here. It's not like I want a ton of friends either, but even just having maybe 3 or 4 people that I feel really close to and can count on would be great. I'm still going to strive for that, but I also need to remind myself that I still have friends I can lean on, even if they're not in the same city as me. Hopefully that will help me feel less lonely, knowing that if I ever do need to reach out to someone, I have people I can talk to. We may not be able to meet up and talk face to face, but they're just a phone call (text, email, whatever) away. I may not be as forever alone as I thought I was...",
