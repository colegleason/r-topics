    "snippet" : "I have major product buildup! My hair is sticky, looks absolutely nasty, and feels even worse. \n\nIt's absolutely embarrassing!!!\n\nI've changed my shampoo (that usually clears it up for me), did the baking soda mask, and even apple-cider vinegar... None of this has worked and I'm freaking out! It looks like I haven't showered in a week and I just got out of the shower! \n\nCan anyone help me???  Same thing happened to me..I used a clarifying shampoo and the sticky residue went away after one wash..but try to avoid using it regularly because i heard its harsh on hair!   Switch to a non sulfate shampoo, and a silicone free conditioner! Also when you wash it, make sure to get really close to your scalp, like under your hair, and scrub with your fingers. I don't really know how to describe it, but my sister showed me how they do it in beauty school, and it always gets things out for me.\n\nAlso maybe try cutting back on the products you use? Although, I know that's easier said than done.    That's the other thing, I don't really use anything besides shampoo and conditioner! Oh, what shampoo/conditioner do you use? Maybe you're not getting all the conditioner out? Well, I was using Aussie moist, but I just got some sort of Pantene.  Oh I used that stuff too! I just switched to TiGi's Epic Volume though, and I'm in love with it. It is pretty pricey though (I'm lucky, my sister is a stylist, so she takes me to the beauty supply stores, and it was half off)\n\nIts probably the silicone/sulfate thing though. I would look in to shampoos/conditioners that doesn't have those. The sulfate is damaging, and the silicone builds up in your hair. Also make sure you're getting all the conditioner out, I know at least for me, my hair looks pretty greasy if I don't really scrub that stuff out when I'm done.      It's possible that u leave the conditioner in too long. It's best results for me is to wash our the shampoo right away, but leave conditioner in for about a minute, usually I wash the body while I wait. There was a time when I got sidetracked shaving my legs and I rinsed it out after like 3 minutes. When I blow dried it still looked slick and shiny, and it a way almost gooey. So I've learned not to wait too long, I personally use Pantene pro V. My hair is really thin, so the creamy, lotion like products work the best. If I Italy not the slimy gooey kind like herbal essence That sounds like you're just not getting all the conditioner out. I have pretty thin hair as well, and I leave my conditioner in for like 10 minutes if I can, and it never comes out greasy...  I've considered that. I was just thinking of one possibility. Dang it's hard to tell tho. Because the conditioner makes it so silky, it's hard to feel its it's still in or just really silky lol",

    "title" : "What's going on with my body?!",
    "snippet" : " I had a missed miscarriage in August and went through a D&amp;C in early September when I was 10 weeks pregnant.  I didn't get my period until a good month and a half later, and then got another one about a week late, which started on December 30. It is now February 25 and I have yet to get my period. I've taken pregnancy tests and they come up negative so I don't know what's going on but I'm coming up on being three weeks late. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I should just go to my doctor, or if my body is still adjusting from the miscarriage. Any advice appreciated.  For crying out loud, call your gyn.  That's what they are there for.\n\nIt may be normal, it may be a sign of something that needs attention.  The most likely outcome is that you'll get reassurance from your doc and some pointers to know what is worrisome and what isn't.\n\nI *am* a doctor, but not a gynecologist.   I guess I just want to make sure I'm not being paranoid, I don't want to have to pay a copay only for the doctor to tell me I'm worrying too much or something.  I appreciate your input though, thanks:-) Phone calls are free.  Call the office and pose a very straightforward question (like you presented it here) and you'll probably get a call back within a day or so.  Even if it's just a medical assistant saying \"the doctor said that's normal\", you'll have your answer. I'm 26 and I've always been on top of my health, but I honestly didn't know this!  Thanks! Yeah, we're not like lawyers, charging for every phone call. Phone calls are free.  Call the office and pose a very straightforward question (like you presented it here) and you'll probably get a call back within a day or so.  Even if it's just a medical assistant saying \"the doctor said that's normal\", you'll have your answer.     You could just call asking for a blood test. I experienced something similar, my dr finally just put me on straight estrogen to get the ball rolling. The hormones still didn't really help my situation, but my monthly blood work put my mind at peace every time it came back negative for pregnancy. What blood test are you going to ask for?  That isn't how medicine works.  Doctors are not technicians who do your bidding.  \n\nWhat you do is call, explain the symptoms, and let the doctor decide if further testing is warranted. I'm sorry if it wasn't clear; a pregnancy blood test. My gyno knew of my problems so, he called for the blood test even though I had taken several home tests that came back negative. It was how both he &amp; I were able to make a strategy on trying to get my body back on track.  ",

    "snippet" : "I just got my IUD on Thursday (five days), and I have some concerns. I've never had kids, so the insertion HURT, but afterwards I just suffered from mild cramps and some light spotting. The next few days were great - really minor cramps, barely a twinge, and barely any spotting. However, today I woke up and definitely felt a bit off. This evening I was hit with the WORST cramps - they feel exactly like the worst menstrual cramps I've ever experienced. I took a bunch of ibuprofen and am in bed with a heating pad right now, but I need some reassurance - is this something I should be concerned about??? I haven't noticed any other side effects. I spent MONTHS researching this, and most women say they experience cramping for up to two weeks... Some say it lasts for up to a year!! Does anyone have some first-hand experience??  My cramps and spotting lasted for about a week with my first IUD and about a month with my second one.  It never hurts to give your doctor a call just to ask if there's any reason for concern, but what you're describing doesn't sound super abnormal.  I've had mine for three months, and the cramps aren't nearly as intense as they used to be. The first week was the worst, but now I have minor cramps for a few days before my period, then 2-4 days of medium-to-icky ones. Heating pads are your friends!\n\nI've also found sex (the motions, not orgasms) can also help alleviate them for a little while.  ",

    "snippet" : "I am 5'10, 135-140 lb, and I feel pressured to keep my weight strictly in check, lest I become 'huge'.\n\nI already tower over MOST women and many of the men I've dated. My last boyfriend said he felt 'emasculated' by my height. My current boyfriend doesn't mind, and doesn't insult me, but does mention my height every once in a while.\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I see the jolly green giant ... especially since I've put on a little winter weight.\n\nAnyone else have this body image problem?  i used to mind my size. i call myself an amazon alpha bitch, and i do not say it lightly. i am over 6ft tall and i weigh almost 230 pounds. i am massive. i am shapely, though. it took me a long time to figure out how attractive i really look. sure, i've got a bit of weight on me, but its all curves and muscle. i've come to love my body, for its aesthetics and capabilities. and the *power*. people fear me. it's wonderful. \n\ni find that others do not like my presence sometimes, however. i live in the deep south, where misogyny and racism are still prevalent. a lot of men look at me in unkind manners. they feel threatened by my clear strength, confidence and my lack of need for them. i see other tall females receive the same disapproval. we're taught that women can't lift as much as men, that we're weak and subordinate. and i tell them all to eat a bag of dicks. i can bench press their fat asses. i can outrun them. i climb mountains, mother fucker. and they will never ever find out how awesome it is to have sex with a warrior woman.  not because they're a certain race, or because of their appearance, or because they're men, but because they're fucking assholes, and i will not let them beat me down into an object.\n\ndont let them beat YOU down! it takes time, but figure out how to revel in your size and capability. i find that appearances show personal capabilities. you were not meant to be meek and mild. you were meant to be strong and confident, and someone that others might disapprove of, but also someone that others admire endlessly and use as inspiration. you have no idea the power bestowed upon you. you are glorious, unique, and wonderful in a way those tiny little girls that your old boyfriend prefers will never be. \n\nfind your war cry!

Amazons UNITE.  Seriously, as a 5'11\" swimmer who has also dabbled in kickboxing (seriously, I'm all legs and it looks really amazing when I can perform a front kick on a target that is eye level with me) I totally agree about the feeling of power.  Being fit and active really helps because you learn to appreciate your body for what it can DO rather then how it looks or what the numbers for it are.\n\nOddly enough I have managed to overcome sexist discrimination because of my height. An old job of mine at a waterpark was trying to recruit some of the lifeguards to do maintenance work cleaning the pools.  Quite a few female guards applied but kept getting turned down because it was heavy work.  I begged for the position (needed the hours and additional pay) and was assertive about it while trying to plug other pool maintenance experience I had from another job.  My boss reluctantly hired me because only one man applied for the job and he needed 2 people.  To this day I feel like the only reason I was chosen was because of my height and the fact I look strong.\n\nAlthough the joke is on my sexist employer, the man they hired quit after only one weekend and I was there every day without fail when they needed me rain or shine, doing whatever, hard labor or gross jobs they needed. well damn, i'd love to watch someone try to mug you. that would be hi-larious.\n\ni love it when i can outshine fellows. i agree men are genetically built with more upper body strength, but if a woman knows how to lift things/move things/carry things/etc, she can probably handle as much weight, if it's not cumbersome and she can use her lower body strength to help. add a massive frame and strength training, as well as determination to break a misogynistic code, and nothing will stop us amazon warriors.\n\n\n Yeah, I've taken a Rape Aggression Defense course before.  People don't think women can be strong.  In RAD they work with our bodies to utilize our natural skills.  You learn to direct all our power through your hips and to use your whole bodies through each strike.  Women will always be strong in our hips and a punch that has the technique to utilize that power will always be stronger then even the punch of a very strong man that uses arms only.\n\nI'm still pissed at those employers for their discrimination against me and the other women that applied for the job.  It didn't even have that much heavy lifting, just willingness to get down and dirty and to clean pools early in the morning before the park opened.  I just hope to this day that my persistence in that job and my male coworker's flakiness on the job convinced my boss that it is worth looking at women for the job and that it is wrong to assume men will be better at something just because they are traditionally stronger. exactly. it's all about education and willingness to beget power, not just raw strength.\n\ni know how you feel about the work discrimination. i got a degree in environmental science and forestry, and letmetellyou, the forestry people are about as backwoods as they come, and they do not take kindly to powerful females. my first day of class i got called a dyke, and i (right in front of the professor) told him that just because i wouldn't ever be interested in him didn't mean i was gay, and that i wouldn't put up with his ignorant and demeaning behavior (insert a few cusswords). after that they mostly ignored me because they knew i wouldn't take their bullshit. a couple of times i got put down again, but i would always react and defend myself. i got mad respect from my professors, though. i never hesitated to assert myself and do well in class. i formed close bonds with a lot of them and they were better friends than my peers could've ever been. it did hurt, though, to be treated that way. for a while i was really lonely, since all my peers were so hateful. i made some art student friends and joined the rugby team, though, and that fixed that lol &gt; my first day of class i got called a dyke, and i (right in front of the professor) told him that just because i wouldn't ever be interested in him didn't mean i was gay\n\nWhat the actual fuck??  Although the rugby team is awesome, I've always been impressed with female rugby players.  The women on the rugby team at my school are the ultimate badasses, its just such a cool sport and those ladies are tough as nails. i used to mind my size. i call myself an amazon alpha bitch, and i do not say it lightly. i am over 6ft tall and i weigh almost 230 pounds. i am massive. i am shapely, though. it took me a long time to figure out how attractive i really look. sure, i've got a bit of weight on me, but its all curves and muscle. i've come to love my body, for its aesthetics and capabilities. and the *power*. people fear me. it's wonderful. \n\ni find that others do not like my presence sometimes, however. i live in the deep south, where misogyny and racism are still prevalent. a lot of men look at me in unkind manners. they feel threatened by my clear strength, confidence and my lack of need for them. i see other tall females receive the same disapproval. we're taught that women can't lift as much as men, that we're weak and subordinate. and i tell them all to eat a bag of dicks. i can bench press their fat asses. i can outrun them. i climb mountains, mother fucker. and they will never ever find out how awesome it is to have sex with a warrior woman.  not because they're a certain race, or because of their appearance, or because they're men, but because they're fucking assholes, and i will not let them beat me down into an object.\n\ndont let them beat YOU down! it takes time, but figure out how to revel in your size and capability. i find that appearances show personal capabilities. you were not meant to be meek and mild. you were meant to be strong and confident, and someone that others might disapprove of, but also someone that others admire endlessly and use as inspiration. you have no idea the power bestowed upon you. you are glorious, unique, and wonderful in a way those tiny little girls that your old boyfriend prefers will never be. \n\nfind your war cry! I am a petite woman but I sometimes wish I had an extra 8 inches and 50 lbs on my frame for just these reasons. You go amazon woman! :) the only female i know who can kick my ass is 5'2 and 100 pounds! you just have to learn how to use your body, however it was made. i'm sure you're a lot quicker than me, like a fox, and i'm like a bear. plus guys love short girls..... especially all of the guys who are bigger than me. which pisses me off. i can't find a proportionate date to save my life. for some reason tiny little dudes are fascinated by me. like, seriously? i can bench press you. i would break you in bed. you weigh half of me. do you think i put on a loincloth and pretend to be a tamed ape or something? i actually like feeling like a lady, thank you very much. i'll go talk to that tall guy over there and see what he's up to.\n\nanyways, end rant lol. the point was something about you're awesome for being petit all the same as us amazons being huge..... All I can think after reading your comment is, \"death by snoo snoo!\" Making me laugh so hard. the only female i know who can kick my ass is 5'2 and 100 pounds! you just have to learn how to use your body, however it was made. i'm sure you're a lot quicker than me, like a fox, and i'm like a bear. plus guys love short girls..... especially all of the guys who are bigger than me. which pisses me off. i can't find a proportionate date to save my life. for some reason tiny little dudes are fascinated by me. like, seriously? i can bench press you. i would break you in bed. you weigh half of me. do you think i put on a loincloth and pretend to be a tamed ape or something? i actually like feeling like a lady, thank you very much. i'll go talk to that tall guy over there and see what he's up to.\n\nanyways, end rant lol. the point was something about you're awesome for being petit all the same as us amazons being huge..... I love my petite body too! I am extremely fit, and I feel spry and quick and I can fit my hands or my whole body in tiny spaces. I am also really into endurance athletics, and being small usually helps. However sometimes I fantasize about being much bigger and maintaining the same fitness level I have now, and what an awesome athlete I would be. I would crush people. None would stand before me! \n\nHigh five for body love and self-confidence :) wonderful! i sometimes think about being small, too, so i could be deemed 'cute' at some point, and be quicker and not like a lumbering bear. it takes all kinds, though!\n\n::high five!:: Heh. I'm like the awkward in-between of both of you. I'm not overly tall (5'9\"), but I'm super lanky, so I don't have the big/strong thing going on and I definitely don't have tiny/quick/cute thing either. But that's what makes us all wonderful!! :) i used to mind my size. i call myself an amazon alpha bitch, and i do not say it lightly. i am over 6ft tall and i weigh almost 230 pounds. i am massive. i am shapely, though. it took me a long time to figure out how attractive i really look. sure, i've got a bit of weight on me, but its all curves and muscle. i've come to love my body, for its aesthetics and capabilities. and the *power*. people fear me. it's wonderful. \n\ni find that others do not like my presence sometimes, however. i live in the deep south, where misogyny and racism are still prevalent. a lot of men look at me in unkind manners. they feel threatened by my clear strength, confidence and my lack of need for them. i see other tall females receive the same disapproval. we're taught that women can't lift as much as men, that we're weak and subordinate. and i tell them all to eat a bag of dicks. i can bench press their fat asses. i can outrun them. i climb mountains, mother fucker. and they will never ever find out how awesome it is to have sex with a warrior woman.  not because they're a certain race, or because of their appearance, or because they're men, but because they're fucking assholes, and i will not let them beat me down into an object.\n\ndont let them beat YOU down! it takes time, but figure out how to revel in your size and capability. i find that appearances show personal capabilities. you were not meant to be meek and mild. you were meant to be strong and confident, and someone that others might disapprove of, but also someone that others admire endlessly and use as inspiration. you have no idea the power bestowed upon you. you are glorious, unique, and wonderful in a way those tiny little girls that your old boyfriend prefers will never be. \n\nfind your war cry!

I would like to remind you that the grass is always greener and so fourth.\n\nAs a \"tiny little girl\" (5ft4, 115 lbs) I have sometimes envied the taller girls for being powerful looking. I do thai boxing and a couple of inches/a few kilos would really help sometimes. But then I think of previously mentioned grass. There is really no need to look down on people to make yourself feel better. if you look at some of my further extrapolated comments, i have no issue with short people. i'm not looking down on anyone, i'm refusing to be looked down upon. i see nothing wrong with being short, but a lot of society has a problem with me being huge, as well as OP and other tall girls. they want us to be like you. and while there is nothing wrong with you i do not want to be like you, i want to be like myself, as every person should want to be themselves and not feel bad for being different. I get that. But I do take some issue with the association of certain personality traits (like strength in the non-psysical sense) with body shape. I take issue because to me it implies that my size makes me a type of person. But I would like to add that I agree with you on how being \"petite\" is encouraged by society. However it is a bit of a double edged sword because I also resent the idea that I look the way I look to please men. I know that is not what you said,  but it is part of the bigger picture. Let's celebrate all kinds of bodies and assert that having a certain kind of body does not make you a certain kind of person. I get that.

Let's celebrate all kinds of bodies and assert that having a certain kind of body does not make you a certain kind of person. well, celebrate away, i take no issue with that. i do assert that your body type influences who you are, though. it determines how you're treated by others, and the things you're capable of doing. so while i'm trying to not be a beaten caged ape, and encouraging others to feel the same, you could easily refuse to be a tiny sex doll and assert yourself as well. Lovely. I will now stop being a \"tiny sex doll\" and start to assert myself.\n\nYour reasoning is part of the problem. Does your body make you a caged ape? Does my body make me a tiny sex doll? I dont believe so. I see myself as a very assertive woman - I am a good public speaker, very well educated and good at handling confrontations. I refuse to be a tiny sex doll every day of my life and I dont think it helps any women to argue that you are a certain way because of your body (i.e not meek and weak, because of your physical strength). i used to mind my size. i call myself an amazon alpha bitch, and i do not say it lightly. i am over 6ft tall and i weigh almost 230 pounds. i am massive. i am shapely, though. it took me a long time to figure out how attractive i really look. sure, i've got a bit of weight on me, but its all curves and muscle. i've come to love my body, for its aesthetics and capabilities. and the *power*. people fear me. it's wonderful. \n\ni find that others do not like my presence sometimes, however. i live in the deep south, where misogyny and racism are still prevalent. a lot of men look at me in unkind manners. they feel threatened by my clear strength, confidence and my lack of need for them. i see other tall females receive the same disapproval. we're taught that women can't lift as much as men, that we're weak and subordinate. and i tell them all to eat a bag of dicks. i can bench press their fat asses. i can outrun them. i climb mountains, mother fucker. and they will never ever find out how awesome it is to have sex with a warrior woman.  not because they're a certain race, or because of their appearance, or because they're men, but because they're fucking assholes, and i will not let them beat me down into an object.\n\ndont let them beat YOU down! it takes time, but figure out how to revel in your size and capability. i find that appearances show personal capabilities. you were not meant to be meek and mild. you were meant to be strong and confident, and someone that others might disapprove of, but also someone that others admire endlessly and use as inspiration. you have no idea the power bestowed upon you. you are glorious, unique, and wonderful in a way those tiny little girls that your old boyfriend prefers will never be. \n\nfind your war cry! [deleted]  6'0\" tall. When I'm not hearing warnings about becoming \"huge\" (155lbs), I'm being accused of having an eating disorder (118-135lbs). I can't win, so I decide to just shrug it off. The way I see it, most of the world is finding ways to appear to be my height (heels, clothing tricks, and the like), so it's mostly people projecting their insecurities onto me. \n\nI'm tall, but I'm not my height. Join /r/tall, you'll fit right in! (hugs) 6' and only 155? jesus, even by the terribly erroneous BMI scale you should be able to go up to 170 or something. i'm 6'1\" and 230 with like 30 pounds being fluff (which spread out isn't bad at all). people are shocked when i tell them my weight, most assume i'm about 180. numbers are bullshit, anyways. it's all about how you look and feel, don't let that asshole scale tell you what to eat.  They have a revised BMI scale.  Its been edited to be more realistic since the previous one didn't account for muscle differences that occur when you are taller.  I'm 5'11\" and I know the revised scale for my height goes from 137 to 185 (I'm 165, right in the middle, haven't been until 140 since 8th grade).  Although I'm sure muscle mass makes a difference.  I mean I guess 165 sounds high as a number but on my body it looks small because I'm so tall, I have a pretty typical \"swimmer's body\". good thing. some scale told me i was morbidly obese and i just laughed. i think i should get down to 200, maybe 190, but at some point i don't care about numbers. i need some fat for the cold weather backpacking. and boobs. we can't forget the boobs. I think the BMI is kind of useless for some body types.  Some people just happen to have a thicker bone structure or they pack more muscle.  I actually read recently that under the current BMI scale 80% of black women are \"obese\".  I guess it doesn't account for the fact that on average people of color tend to be curvier then the average white women and of course the scales were made for a Western audience.  Its kind of fucked up how it doesn't account for the different shapes at all.\n\nI have several friends like you, well not tall but considered \"obese\" by the scale just because of a thicker bone structure and more muscle mass or a curvy body type.  Its not a good tool for certain people.  I guess what is important is if you are eating well and being active.  The numbers themselves don't really matter. 6' and only 155? jesus, even by the terribly erroneous BMI scale you should be able to go up to 170 or something. i'm 6'1\" and 230 with like 30 pounds being fluff (which spread out isn't bad at all). people are shocked when i tell them my weight, most assume i'm about 180. numbers are bullshit, anyways. it's all about how you look and feel, don't let that asshole scale tell you what to eat.  I live in SoCal, so the pressure on me to be my height and model thin is ridiculous. People here have absolutely no problem calling me fat because of that absurd stereotype. This, of course, is made worse in my social circle because I have been \"model thin\" in the past and have since put on a more healthy weight. So the same people who used to whine and claim they were worried I had bulimia or anorexia or whatever when I was tiny are now the same people claiming I have \"let myself go\" and shouldn't be wearing the same type of clothes I was wearing when I was small because \"it's pathetic\" or \"is making you look fatter.\" WTH? Again, I think all of this is more due to the notion that I *tower* over these people and no matter what weight I am, at my height (and \"look,\" I'm sure, LOL), I am intimidating and it makes other (insecure) people nervous.  \n\nAnd you're absolutely right, numbers are just that--numbers! I don't give a flying fuck anymore what that number says on the scale, and as such, the only feet that touch the scale in my house are my SO's and my cat's (he's a little butterball). The way I see it, if I want to indulge in a delicious craft brew on the weekend, I go right ahead. I'm not looking to the scale for permission because that is no way to live.\n\nAs long as I'm happy about my body and feel good about my jiggly bits I don't care what weight I am.  i'm sorry, but your friends are assholes if you're at a healthy weight and they're criticizing you. \n\nit is more fun to have a bit of fluff on you. i like [this](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/166972_232919280098120_161042172_n.jpg) image to demonstrate how one can be healthy and defy the norm. the outline on her body is to show what would be cut off if she had Barbie proportions.\n\nand kudos to you for being healthy while being around critical people. it's hard enough to like your own body with the standards we're put to, but to do it against the advice of those around you? you must be pretty damn proud.  I have a lot of people in my life with body image issues, unfortunately. It didn't make sense to me that *my* weight created a lose/lose situation despite the range of weight I have had through the years. Logic dictates that my weight has less to do with me and more to do with those who see fit to comment upon my weight.  \n\nAnd yes, I am very proud of my fluffy.   I'm 6' tall and what you'd call \"solid\" -- muscular, good posture, thick legs, small waist, and a respectably large chest. I am definitely big and built like the prototypical Amazon woman. And I used to feel really weird and uncomfortable about that for the same reasons as you.\n\nOver time I got mostly used to my size, but then I took up a grappling sport and realized that being big was fucking awesome. I'm not hating on short or thin ladies here, but there is something extremely potent about realizing that you are powerful merely because of your size. That you are able to physically dominate a lot of people just because you're bigger. It's a very primal feeling. And being in that atmosphere, where strength is respected and admired rather than feared or considered unfeminine, changed my own view of my body and stopped me from feeling so alienated from it.\n\nAs for some men feeling emasculated by our mere presence... Good. If they want to give me that dominance without me even having to fight for it, I'll take it. everything you just said makes me feel like you're my mysterious twin sister who was magicked away at birth.

This semester we're really follow heavy and I've been leading a lot.  I'm one of the few girls that can actually lead dips and stuff like that.  It's pretty fun. I taught a friend of mine who is like 5'/5'1\" to lead dips. It's mostly leverage and good body mechanics.

I'm short, 5'1\", and when I got up to my heaviest, 169, I felt like a fucking Oompa Loompa. So everyone has body issues. No ones perfect. And if anyone says anything, just crack a joke like \"we'll at least I can reach the top shelf!\" Lol  I'm not 5'10, but I'm 5'8 and...big. I just feel like I'm BIG. Not ladylike or \"Delicate\" At all. I'm 180 lbs and standing next to an average woman always sucks.  I'm not 5'10, but I'm 5'8 and...big. I just feel like I'm BIG. Not ladylike or \"Delicate\" At all. I'm 180 lbs and standing next to an average woman always sucks.    I'm 5'10 175 lb (working on getting down to 155 again). I love being tall. I feel more respected when talking to clients, I can reach things on the top shelf, I don't get grabbed very often... It's nice. My boyfriend and I are the same height. I don't wear heels around him often because I know he doesn't really like it, but otherwise I love wearing heels and being taller than everyone. Maybe I'm just an attention whore. :)  I'm 5'11\" and about 200lbs right now. My *lowest* adult weight is 165, I legitimately have a large structure of bone and muscle under the post-baby weight. Sometimes I get pangs when I see other tall women with weight like yours, and I have to just shake it off because I know that I'll never get down there. I recently met another tall girl who was just stunning and around your weight, and I tried not to be jealous of her wasp waist and delicate bone structure in her wrists and fingers. I'm me, and I'm tall and powerful. I take up a lot of space, I know I do. Sometimes I remind myself that height is a good thing when I reach for stuff on tall shelves, or that my she-hulk strength is a huge asset when I take something off someone else's hands who's struggling (and I find it to be no burden at all). The worst part about my size - the one thing that constantly reminds me that I am abnormal - is trying to buy god damn clothes. I mostly shop online to get around this, because shopping in stores is consistently demoralizing. ON/Gap/BR has tall sizes for shirts and sweaters, Buckle carries jeans in 35\" inseams, etc. \n\nMy nicknames through my life have been Amazon, Yeti (this one was actually affectionate, if you can believe it), Miss Universe, and some other less pleasant ones hung on me by douchey frat types. I know that I intimidate some people. I know that some people perceive my height with more weight on its importance/significance than I do. It's not my job to worry about those people though - I'm friendly, quick to smile and a decent human being. It's their loss if they can't see past my height.\n\nMy fiance is the same height as me and doesn't care a bit about it. When I'm with him, I forget about how tall I am. Every once in a while if I put on heels or tall shoes, I'll become a little self-aware that I'm taller than him - but he just compliments me. Since we're both military (he's in the reserves right now), when he comes home in boots and I'm barefoot I'll revel in the few minutes of him being taller than me.\n\nI can't change my height. I can (and will) take up 30lbs less space, but otherwise I'm just here and I'm giant. I'm a good person. I'm loved, and have many people to love back.   I'm not tall enough to qualify I think, but if you want to find more tall people who feel awkward about their height, check out /r/tall. It's a great community, according to my 6'6\" boyfriend, and you may find some sympathetic people there.\n\nI know it's going to sound silly, but I'm 5'6\" and I kind of feel the same way. I'm not taller than most men or anything, but next to my mom's family where all of the women are 5'3\" or shorter and they're all 110 lb or lighter with very slender figures, narrow hips, small chests, etc, at 5'6\" and 150 lb, I feel like enormous in every dimension. And I know I'm healthy and just built differently with my 40\" hips and 38\" bust, but I just always feel so awkward next to them and I always feel this pressure to lose weight at family functions when I'm otherwise very happy with my figure. I think that's really interesting about the way you relate your height to your family. I'm 6' and my measurements are something like 36-28-44, and I have always felt like a giant next to my \"petite\" mom standing at 5'6\". I guess it goes to show that it's all relative.  Your family definitely affects how you perceive your size.  I have a cousin on my dad's side who is 5'8\" and she feels short over there, where even my great-grandmother is 5'7\" after shrinking and our grandmother is 5'9\" and our dads and uncle and grandpa and great-grandpa are all over 6'.  I don't see that side of the family as often and when I do I'm with my 5'1\" mom so I don't feel as out of place and it doesn't affect me as much, but it would seem that everyone judges their height by their family to some extent.

Are you kidding? You are tiny, I'm 5'11\" 165 pounds (size 10/12, long of course but I am slightly pear shaped) and everyone thinks I am thin.  I seriously haven't weighed as little as you since middle school.  The numbers might be big but remember that at a tall height you are going to weigh more since your body has to support more muscle.  \n\nLove your body for what it can do and don't focus on the number.  Yeah 165 pounds sounds high but I've never felt fat or looked it, I've always been fairly toned and got some good genetics and a flat stomach. I swam competitively for 9 years and more recently took up Zumba and kickboxing (probably accounts for some of my weight because of the muscle).  You learn to appreciate your body for what it can DO rather then abstract things like the numbers.  Maybe consider doing something active?  Dancing, Yoga, Cycling, Swimming, whatever floats your boat.\n\nOwn your height, its part of you and it can be used to your advantage.  You are powerful, graceful and statuesque, the Greeks used to took up to tall women like they were demi-gods, there's no reason to feel bad about your height.\n\nYou will always intimidate men and women (especially men) but think about it this way, do you really want to date a guy who is so insecure that he can't handle your height?  I know I wouldn't.  I want a man who appreciates me for who I am and I know I'm intimidating and its not just my height (try being tall, opinionated, smart, articulate and sexually aggressive, you scare EVERYONE).  \n\nI gave up dating guys taller then me (because its hard to find them sometimes) and I just go for who is compatible and who likes me and loves my height, assertiveness and intelligence.  I found my partner that way and while he is slightly shorter then me he doesn't give a fuck.  Its refreshing to experience that when half the guys taller then me STILL feel intimidated.  There are people out there that will like you and recognize that you are beautiful, Amazon height or not.\n\nBut please, cut out this \"I'm fat bullshit\" you are on the absolute lowest end of the healthy range of the BMI scale for your height, you are anything but fat. \n\nDon't listen to this societal bullshit that women have to be small and petite to be feminine, women come in all shapes and sizes and there is a beauty that comes with being a tall Amazon, when you learn to own it and rock your height you will be much happier.  There are people out there who will be captivated by it and not afraid of it.  Interesting, I'm around 5'9\" and 170 pounds, not much of a big difference in height, but people definitely do not call me thin. I also wear 10/12. I'm in the UK right now so I'm a 14/16 because of different sizing systems. A skinny friend of mine was shocked when I told her I wear 16s (I prefer to wear my clothes loose because of insecurities about my stomach and size 10s not always fitting in the arms). It made me feel fat! I guess she thought I must look smaller than that?  I know I'm not thin though. I have a small waist but everywhere else is curvy. It's interesting the difference 2\" can make.   5'10 and 167 lb here with naturally wide hips and large breasts.  Since high school, my closest friends have always been shorter and smaller than me, and its always felt like a treat to hang out with people taller than me.  Pants have never been long enough, and unless I develop an eating disorder, I'm pretty positive I will never jeans that are less than a size 12.  My feet are size 11, so it's hard to find pretty shoes that both fit and are comfortable.\n\nShopping used to cause me a lot of anxiety because I focused on the numbers I saw on the tags and assumed I was fat, and being tall has made me feel unfeminine at times.\n\nBut on the other hand, people take me more seriously in professional settings, which is very useful to be since I have a very feminine look and way of communicating.  I'm more independant because I can reach the top shelf myself.  And I've been able to silence cat-callers with a glare, which I attribute to my imposing stature.  When I stand up straight and open my mouth, people pay attention.\n\nBeing tall has made me feel uncomfortable many times in my life, but when I'm able to stand back and look at myself objectively, I'm pretty good looking both despite and because of my height.  I've only ever had friends tell me that they liked my height.\n\nSo I guess the answer is yes, my height makes me uncomfortable sometimes.  But just like anything that prevents you from blending in with the crowd - curly hair, big boobs, red hair - you just gotta own it! 5'10 and 167 lb here with naturally wide hips and large breasts.

But just like anything that prevents you from blending in with the crowd - curly hair, big boobs, red hair - you just gotta own it! The shoes thing! I'm an 11 too, it's awful! I'm an 11 but I have narrow skinny feet.  Shoes are impossible to find since few things are long enough and everything is too wide.  Size 10/11 narrow is really a thing that doesn't exist. You are my foot twin, skinny long feet. I also have really skinny ankles and calves so size (eur: 42, US: 11) boots look ridiculously baggy on me. I even managed to find some skinny-fit boots that were still loose at size 11. At least in winter we have room for layers of socks in our shoes. :) Yep, I can't buy boots that don't need to be worn with REALLY thick socks.  Most of my shoes have to have laces or buckets but occasionally I find flip flops that are narrower.  High heels are out for me most of the time because they are never narrow enough and besides I'm clumsy, I look like an awkward giraffe on stilts when I wear heels. The shoes thing! I'm an 11 too, it's awful!          When I was younger, yes.  But then I realized there wasn't a problem with my body.  I'm about 5'11\" an even when swimming 4+hours a day never got under 145, 150.  I'm now about 155 and a size 6.  I lived in Asia for nearly four years and dated a lot of men my height or shorter.  My legs are longer than just about every guy I've dated, my feet (solid 11) are usually as big as theirs. Sometimes we can even share clothes.  At first I was uncomfortable, but eventually, because they didn't care, I stopped caring.  Not a single one of them was intimidated by me and in fact really liked my body.  It really boosted my confidence.  \n\nHowever being back in the States I get what you mean, especially in the South.  I find the men on average shorter here and more conscientious about being \"the man\".  I also find a lot of pressure for women to be petite/dainty which can sort of mess with your head if you aren't that.  All I can say is that lots of men will love your height and lots of men will be intimidated by it.  I wouldn't let their opinions though drive your self-image.  There is something incredibly empowering about being our height and you should wear it confidently.  I've learned to enjoy being called Amazon Queen or Xena Warrior princess as they're both fiercely powerful and independent women. Another tall swimmer here, I'm your same height and I haven't been 140 pounds since middle school.  Currently I'm 165 and its pretty good for me, I was 155 about a year ago (birth control made me gain the 10 pounds, although its a small price to pay to be not pregnant and not crazy) and I still wear the same clothes comfortably as I did then and took pretty toned (I think the weight when to boobs and hips).  Even at 155 I was a size 10/12 (still am).  How are you a size 6?  Do you have really narrow hips or something?  Hell I don't think my pelvic bones alone would fit in a size 6.   I don't know. I'm an American 6...maybe we're talking different sizes?  I think that'd make me a British 10/12.  I never thought of myself as having narrow hips, but I have very bony hips and an incredibly flat stomach, I assumed due to dolphin kicking.  My thighs and shoulders are probably the thickest parts.  Most people assume I'm 135, 140.\n\nMaybe I like my clothes a bit tighter on bottom?  8's tend to only fit the first few wears and then sag a bit in the belt area and on my ass so I'm constantly pulling them up.  The 6's are a tight fit at first but generally stretch.  I guess if the material doesn't stretch I'd be an 8 but all my dress slacks, shorts, pants and what not are a 6 and no underwear lines show so I assume that's the correct size.  The only time I was a 10 was when I was at 175 and that was also due to weight gain from BC.  Maybe I have a flatter ass? I'm American, I do mean an American 10/12.  I haven't been a size 6 since the 6th grade, I have a completely flat stomach although my hips are a bit wider then then average.\n\nThis isn't me but when I put my specifics into My Body Gallery, [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-21956-body-shape.htm#img) is one of the photos that comes up.  I look similar only more toned in the midsection and thicker thighs and wider hips.  Its interesting to me how people's bodies are different even at the same height/weight.  I could never fit a size 6, haven't since the 6th grade.\n As I've been in Asia and now in the South where many girls my height are a size 2-4 I've always felt bigger.  That is interesting, but maybe it is genes.  My mom was a size zero at 5'9\" until she got pregnant and I was a size 4 while swimming...looking at old swimming photos I look look like a top heavy bean pole with most my mass in my chest and shoulders.  Very strong V-shape. Yeah well I'm about the opposite of a \"top heavy bean pole\".  My upper body and waist is much smaller then my hips and thighs which probably accounts for the difference.  My long legs do help to make my hips appear smaller but I definitely carry my weight there, I'm kind of pear shaped just stretched over a really long body with disproportionately long legs.        I'm 5'9 or 5'10 and weigh 160lbs. I'm within a healthy BMI but really feel I should be (a lot) slimmer, even though my boyfriend says he loves my body. I just can't get rid of it :(   I am pretty light on my feet, even at 5' 11\" and 235 pounds, so I never feel 'huge'. I have a very curvy, padded, body type just like all the women in my family, so the only time I actually FEEL like i'm huge is around my period. My current boyfriend is two inches shorter than me and I doubt I could ever emasculate him. xD he's darn manly and can still throw me around. You and I have exactly the same body. Fistbump.           Ugh. I feel you. And isn't it so great when people say \"You're just so big....err, I mean tall.\"?    As a 6'3\", 240lb man, let me just throw in my two cents by stating that I love tall girls.  If a girl is shorter than 5'9\", I am not even noticing because I don't care.  I want someone I can see eye-to-eye with.  Do not be ashamed of being tall, know that there are many of guys out there that love it! You are a rare breed.  Most men even men of your height are afraid of me (I'm 5'11\").  Men of quality in general are hard to find especially when you scare them away so I gave up on finding a tall man a long time ago.   what city are you in? South, central Florida.  I am currently dating an amazing guy but he's shorter then I am.  Of the men I have dated only one was more then an inch taller then me, most are about the same height as I am.  I'm happy with my partner and he's amazing, but it seems ridiculous to me how hard it was to find a guy like him who didn't see me as intimidating.          I'm 5'11\" around 150 now. My doctor has told me I should weigh 160, but I have a medium frame and don't feel good at that weight. I'm not muscular so those ten pounds would be fat on my ass. I don't have to diet or up my workouts to maintain 145-150, so I'm good there. My mom likes to tell me that I could gain weight and look good because I'm tall. What?   &gt;My mom likes to tell me that I could gain weight and look good because I'm tall. What?\n\nI mean it is kind of true.  I'm 5'11\" and I used to be about 155 but since going on birth control I gained a bit of weight (small price to pay to be not pregnant and not crazy) and I'm now at 165.  You honestly can't tell much of a difference, I mean its slight.  I still fit in all the same clothes and my stomach is still flat and toned even though its a higher number.  I work out a lot and I'm pretty fit and I feel good so I know its not something to worry about.\n\nPersonally I haven't been 145 since the 9th grade, my hips are a bit wider and I've always been toned from swimming so maybe that has something to do with it.   To me, it's always been about being comfortable in my own skin. I don't really care what size I wear or whether someone else thinks I look good. Arbitrary numbers chosen by someone else for me are not important. I have weighed a lot less (120) and a lot more (195) and feel better at 150. Also, I am too lazy to work out more than I do, so adding muscle just isn't going to happen.  Oh I'm not arguing about you feeling better.  I was just trying to explain what your mom said about gaining weight and it not being noticeable.  I mean for myself 155 and 165 don't look much different. I get that. It's not about how well I could carry it to me. Ten pounds also means the difference between wearing what I own and having to buy a new wardrobe. And I hate clothes shopping!               5'10\" 125-130 lbs. I totally feel your pain. I feel like I need to stay around 120-125 lbs, to avoid feeling massive in all ways. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are the same height, I might have a half inch on him. I just don't feel pretty or feminine when I get too big.\n\nAlso I feel your pain on winter weight, ugh.   You realize 125-130 is absolutely tiny at your weight?  I'm only an inch taller then you and easily 35 pounds heavier and most people think I'm skinny (typical swimmer's body).  I haven't been 125 pounds since maybe the 5th or 6th grade. I'm built really small, and have like no shape to speak of. I usually balance out between those weights no matter what I do. Its obviously not literally fat that is the problem for me, its gaining weight in awkward spots, and the fact that I have zero waist definition once I get over 135. I'm not unhealthy though, I eat enough, and am just have an active job. I'm thin, but I'm still allowed to feel uncomfortable on my off days.  \n\nAlso, I'm a swimmer (well, was from age 5-19) too! Yay! &gt;the fact that I have zero waist definition once I get over 135. \n\nWeird, not something I've ever encountered personally.  I was bean pole with no curves back when I was your weight, I looked more like a girl then a woman.  Now that I have curves I don't think I could ever get below 150 at the lowest.  I guess it really does have more to do with where you gain weight.  All of mine goes to my hips and thighs and really never to my waist.  \n\nI swam for 9 years, not quite as long as you (9-18), but I still keep active with Zumba and kickboxing.  All those years of swimming made me reliant on exercise to keep my stress levels down. Yea at 25, I have all the body definition of a ruler haha. My sister got the white Beyonce body, sigh. I used to be 165 lbs due to medications, back in high school. I gained all the weight in my waist, inner thighs, and upper arms (which is super awkward because I have tiny forearms, and they stay the same size. T-rex arms haha) also I get a really bad tire. \n\nI have always wanted to try kick boxing! I'm trying hot yoga for the first time tomorrow, I'm nervous. I agree though, I need to be doing something active, even if its just work.      sorry but thats horrible you have this unrealistic expectation of yourself because thats ridiculous. where i live, im in my final year of highschool and 40% of the girls in my year would be approaching 5'10 (one of which is literally 6'8 and still attractive), and plenty are a lot heavier than 140 pounds. hell, as a 12 year old 5'4 i was 130 pounds. i think you just need to relax a little and try not to worry about it much, because in this modern age 5'10 is by no means \"emasculating\" when the average height is over 6 foot. Im 5'11 and considered small Its not unrealistic at all actually. 135-140 lbs is in the healthy weight range for that height, and she might just be built  smaller than the people you know. I'm 5'10\" and usually around 125 lbs, and I'm perfectly healthy.\n\nBody policing isn't cool, keep it to yourself. ",

    "snippet" : "[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18zjfm/menstrual_issues_i_have_an_appointment_scheduled/)\n\nWall of text warning/apology.\n\nSo my appointment was on Saturday, and unfortunately, I'm left feeling that it was a waste of time and money.  I tried to confirm over the phone that it was going to be worthwhile to go in, being that the planned parenthood website says that not all services are available on the weekends.  I expressed that it was a long drive and was assured that there was a lot that they could do for me and that I should come in.\n\nSo fine, I drove two hours to get there and I arrived about 30 mins early.  The people in the office were nice, I filled out my paperwork, and waited for them to call me back.\n\nThe lady who called me back was nice, she listened to my concerns, and asked all the questions she was supposed to ask (how many sexual partners in the last year, how long have you been sexually active, last sexual activity, protected/unprotected, etc).  Then she left me to undress from the waist down and prep for the pelvic exam that another woman was going to do.\n\nSeveral minutes later, the nurse practitioner comes in for the exam.  She confirms a couple of the sexual history questions that I was previously asked by the nurse.  We also do another quick run through my symptoms, no period for about 6 mos, period resumed lighter than normal, cycle shortened and shortened, and finally, bleeding since January 29th with intermittent extremely heavy bleeding.  Day of the appointment, bleeding is relatively light, however.\n\nAs we're about to start the pelvic exam, I explain to her that I've never been to a gynecologist before, and that I'm a little anxious.  Instead of offering any reassurance, she incredulously asked how old I was.  She was not gentle, she did not warn me or explain anything about what she was doing.  The exam was uncomfortable and at times painful.  A couple of times, she withdrew her tools and I thought she was finished, but with no warning, she would shove something else inside of me.  I jumped a couple of times, which was embarrassing, but I wished she would have given me some kind of cue to know that she was about to do something.\n\nAfter she finished, she left me to get dressed and told me she would need a urine sample.  A little problematic being that I had used the restroom right when I arrived (2 hour drive).  So I got dressed and managed to provide a sample.  I was instructed to wait while they processed my \"test results.\"  At this point, I want to point out that they never explained what tests they were doing, never asked me to consent to any testing, so as far as I knew, they did a pelvic exam and they wanted a urine sample.\n\nSo I wait for my results, and she comes back and says she thinks I have bacterial vaginosis.  She explains all the symptoms, and watches me look more and more confused, as I don't have any of the symptoms she is naming.  She finishes off with \"or you may have no symptoms at all.\"  I ask her if I tested positive for this.  She says they don't have a test, it is just a condition that can \"mess with the menstrual cycle.\"  She can tell that I'm not 100% on board with her diagnosis, so she asks a couple of other questions \"Your symptoms just started all of a sudden, right?\"\n\n\"No...this has been going on for about a year and a half now.\"  At this point, I realize she didn't really listen to what I told her about my period history/symptoms.\n\nShe tells me they can give me some medicine for BV, but if it doesn't work I can come back after fasting and they can perform some other tests.  I ask if there are any other worthwhile tests that can be done today because it is a long drive for me to get there.  She says they can do a blood test to check my hormone levels.  I tell her I would like to do that.  She leaves to go get the materials she will need.  In the ten minutes that she's gone, I'm reading the vaginosis pamphlet that she left and trying to understand why she came to that conclusion.  When she returned, she let me know that she was sorry, they didn't have the ability to do the hormone test, but she could give me a referral to a gynecologist.  She doesn't know if any of them are open on Saturdays, and she tells me the waitlist is likely several weeks out for any of them.\n\nI agree to take the referral, though I know I won't use it because she is going to refer me to doctors in her city, and there are gynecologists in my city, I just have to find one that will take someone uninsured and either allow me to make payments or at least tell me costs up front.  So a few minutes later when she gives me the paper, I ask her about the medicine for vaginosis.  She tells me they have it in stock and that it won't hurt for me to take it, even if I don't have vaginosis.  Which left me with real confidence in her diagnosis.\n\nSo I go up front and they give me my total.  $162.  A little more than the $85 I was told over the phone, but whatever, I pay it, and look through my receipt after I go outside to wait for my ride.\n\nI'm not going to dispute any of what they charged me for, but it upset me.  First, the appointment was $99, not $85.  Second, I was charged $36 for a gonorrhea and chlamydia test, which they never told me they were doing.  I was also charged $12 for a pregnancy test, which they didn't tell me they were doing until after it was done.  The nurse practitioner told me she needed a urine sample, she didn't tell me why.  I do acknowledge that I would have agreed to the pregnancy test had they offered it though.  And then $15 for the medicine, which again I was never told a price for, but at least I had agreed to.\n\nNow in my case, all these extra charges weren't a big deal, because I had made sure I had more funds than what they told me, just in case.  But can you imagine someone who came in with exactly the cash for what he/she was told over the phone?  I'm sure they would make payment arrangements, but by the time you're getting your bill, you're back up front in the lobby, and how embarrassing would that be, to be up there in front of a bunch of strangers explaining that you can't afford your total?\n\nI want to clarify that I support planned parenthood.  I believe that men and women should have access to affordable sexual and reproductive health care.  But the somewhat expensive lesson I have learned is that planned parenthood is not a substitute for an actual gynecologist.\n\nI feel like I was lumped into a group because I was honest and told them that I have had unprotected sex with my boyfriend.  We use condoms sometimes, but often use the withdrawal method.  If we were actively trying to prevent pregnancy, we both know that this is not enough.  However, we're both 28, and we've been together for 7 years.  Neither of us have ever had any other sexual partners, and we plan to get married.  We're not actively trying to conceive, but we're also not actively trying to prevent it, because we do want children.  I'm going to have health benefits through my job by summer, so we're honestly not in that bad of a place, I'm mostly just broke from paying off old debt right now.\n\nBut anyways, back on topic.  I spent $60 in gas, and $162 in the office, and I left with the knowledge that I'm not pregnant, which I already kind of knew through repeated pregnancy tests (I was concerned about possible miscarriage when the heavy bleeding happened the first time.  I also know that I do not have gonorrhea or chlamydia, which again, was not on my radar at all, and if I had tested positive, someone would have had some 'splaining to do.  I laugh now, but I was a little pissed to pay almost $40 for a test that no one breathed a word about, it just appeared on my receipt.  I am going to take the medicine for BV, though I'm pretty sure I do not have that either, being that there was no test done for that and I have none of the symptoms.\n\nSo at this point, my next step is to try to find an affordable gynecologist who is taking new patients, accepts uninsured patients, and possibly allows payment plans.  I will have to wait until we are finished with our audit at work so that I am able to take time off during the week, which is a little frustrating, but most gynecologists around here seem to have a waitlist anyway, so the audit will probably be over by the time they can get me in anyway.\n\nSorry to bore.  I don't know if anyone wanted an update anyway, but I figured I'd share the lesson I learned, in the hopes that it might save someone else the time/money.\n\nTLDR: Wahhhhhhh nothing was fixed, I'm still bleeding, my hoohah is still sore from the less than gentle nurse practitioner, and I'm $222 poorer.  Ugh, I'm so sorry about this. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for things like this to occur in routine medical offices since most patients never see itemized lists and the charges just go straight through to the insurance company. But Planned Parenthood, who aims to fill the gap for uninsured women, should know better than to run a practice in this way.\n\nA tip for when you find a practice and you want to pay cash, tell them before your visit or when you first come in. So often they will offer you a significantly reduced rate compared to what they would charge your insurance company. Some of them are even glad to so that they don't have to deal with insurance. You can also request that they note your file that you wish to have no testing done without prior permission.\n\nI do also want to mention that it may be unwise to not be actively trying to prevent pregnancy while you are uninsured. You may be getting insurance by summer, but if you were to get pregnant and miscarry you could find yourself with a hefty ER bill. Yeah, I was a little surprised because over the phone the woman who scheduled me made sure to tell me what the office visit would cost up front, so I wrongfully assumed that they would extend the same courtesy for anything else they were going to do.\n\nThanks for the tips on when I find someone to see me, after this, I will have to make it clear to any office that if something's coming out of my wallet, I want to know why and be given the ability to consent.\n\nRest assured that if I were to become pregnant, I would be getting insurance immediately, whether I had to get it on my own or talk to my employer about offering insurance sooner than planned (we're a small company of less than 10 employees).  As a last resort, my state offers low cost health insurance to pregnant women, so even if the other options weren't going to work out, that one would.\n\nDespite having all of that in the back of my mind, my boyfriend and I are not actively trying to conceive, we're using either condoms or withdrawal every time.  The one and only time that he finished inside me with no condom, we were using a spermicidal sponge, but we used Plan B the next day anyway.  So I guess we are acting in a way to prevent pregnancy, but at the planned parenthood, I was made to feel stupid for using the words \"withdrawal method.\"  I guess as a healthcare provider you have to be skeptical of what people are telling you, so they assume that whatever you tell them, you're not using it reliably.  So when I say we use withdrawal she figures I'm having unprotected sex involving him finishing inside me every other day, which is not the case at all.\n\nEdit: grammar Oh I didn't mean to sound judgey or anything, I just wanted to mention it for safetys sake! Sounds like you have it all under control! I hope you can figure out what ails you sooner rather than later!  Yikes, that's a mess. Depending on your location there might be some other avenues available to you aside from a PP office two hours away. Most cities in the US have a county health department. The diagnostic abilities vary wildly, but many are well-staffed to handle basic medical concerns. I know a lot of women get care from PP but they aren't in every city and the health department can often do free/low-cost annual exams, prescribe birth control, give out condoms, do STD tests, etc. At the very least they should be able to refer you to a gynecologist who is willing to work with an uninsured patient. This may not be viable in your area, but I refer a lot of women to my county's health department and they really do good work (I'm in social services and my state's Medicaid program is basically nonexistent).

    "snippet" : "Hi ladies (or gents),\n\nI'm currently in my third year of college, planning to graduate early in December. I'm double-majoring and constantly working unpaid internships. A higher power has blessed me with my parents, who support everything I do in the interest of my future career.\n\nAnyway - I have about 500 dollars to my name. My parents pay my bills to live and eat. Sometimes I save the excess money they give me for food.\n\nSo here's my question: what can I be doing with my money? ...is there money magic? How can I make interest on my meager amount?\n\nAny general life suggestions? All I can ever think about is how I have no money and how I'm not earning any money. I love my parents and am starting to feel guilty.\n\nThanks for any help!  Making any kind of substantial \"interest\" off of $500 is difficult. \n\nIs there any way to not do the unpaid internships and instead find a paying job? In university, I didn't do internships because I needed to work, so I bartended and waitressed and cashier-ed and all that.\n\nI was worried about not having field-related experience once I finished school, but I found that employers actually looked quite well on my having those jobs, even though they weren't office jobs or in any way related to my field. (In fact, this year when I was doing some hiring, everyone just loved this guy who had worked as a McDonald's manager through school, over about a half-dozen people who had things like working in Africa or at the UN on their resumes.)\n\nEdit: And don't be ashamed to have to eat a lot of beans and jam sandwiches!  I could work a paying job, but it's not like I'm in dire need, since my parents pay for everything I need. So unless I'm really needing that money, I think I will probably continue working in my field as much as possible.\n\nI have worked other jobs though. I worked quite a bit cashiering, catering, and freelancing, but it all seemed to put me behind in my courses. :(\n\nThanks for your response, I appreciate it! I actually strongly suggest you forego the paid work if it is unrelated to your field.  When you graduate and seek employment, the experience from your internships will pay for itself many, many, many times over.  \n\nMake as many contacts as you can - learn to network and get to know as many people as possible in your field.  /r/personalfinance.

    "snippet" : "One of my coworkers gave birth back in November, which is nice and all.  In fact, after 29 years of saying I was never going to have children, I finally decided that I think I'd like to have kids one day.  \n\nIn November, I casually mentioned to my coworker that even though I don't have a spouse or any interest in obtaining a spouse, that I may have a child in a few years (hey, sperm banks!).  I also casually mentioned that I would probably have a c-section, as the idea of many hours of labor is immensely stressful to me.  My coworker flipped out on me, informing me that this was extremely dangerous for the baby, for me, and that something like 50% of women who have c-sections die.  I said I thought that number couldn't be right, but decided that I didn't want to argue with her.\n\nShe came back to work on Saturday and the first words out of her mouth were, \"Oh, I talked to my mom, who is a midwife, and you shouldn't have a c-section because it's too dangerous.  50% of people die, I knew I was right.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but this is a mythical child of the future that I have not even decided to have yet.  And secondly, it's none of her damn business if I have a c-section or not, it's something I'd want to talk to my doctor about and make my own informed decision about first.  And just---this has made me so fucking angry for reasons I'm not entirely certain of.  For some reason, this reminds me of the post last week about how c-section babies aren't \"born\", and some women who have c-sections are given shit from other parents because it isn't natural.  I'm just super annoyed that I'm not even pregnant and I'm already getting this.\n\nThanks, TwoX.  Needed to get that off my chest.  If you're going to become a parent, get used to everyone telling you you're doing it wrong.\n\nI'm not a parent, I've just noticed it turns a lot of people into self-righteous pricks. I'm in a club for moms, and one of the things some of the moms say is, \"I was the *best* parent before I became a mother!\" If you're going to become a parent, get used to everyone telling you you're doing it wrong.\n\nI'm not a parent, I've just noticed it turns a lot of people into self-righteous pricks.

You are absolutely right that those numbers are completely bullshit.  The mortality rate is something like [20 of 1,000,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section#Risks_for_the_mother).  Your co-worker has been fed a line of shit by her mom (based on your story) and she hasn't figured it out yet.  Besides, if C-sections were really so deadly for women, no one would have one!  Something like 1/3 of babies are born by C-section in the US*.\n\nIt's a good thing you didn't argue with her!  Crazy or stupid people should never be argued with, b/c you can never win. To be fair, there is strong consensus that natural births are healthier for the woman and the baby.  But you're right that c-sections don't endanger women's lives.

But you're right that c-sections don't endanger women's lives. Can you provide any references to the claim that natural births are healthier for the woman &amp; the baby?  I am a midwife and your colleague is spouting bullshit. not only does that 50% seem way off, but can you tell me, is a c-section relatively safe? isn't the chance of a c-section causing death to mom or baby only in the case of an emergency c-section, in which case it's not even the c-section causing the chance of death, it's whatever complications that lead to it? It is a major abdominal surgery that results in twice the blood loss of a vaginal delivery and requires two months of limited activity to heal. It's major surgery, of course, but it is relatively safe. If it wasn't, a lot more women would be a lot more cautious about having babies. (I had an emergency c-section with no complications, and I was walking within a couple days, doing desk work within a week or two (my son was in the NICU), and back to normal within a couple months.  It is a major abdominal surgery that results in twice the blood loss of a vaginal delivery and requires two months of limited activity to heal. Two months of limited activity is a bit of an overestimation. I took 5 months to heal. But I also had severe wound complications. But I was up and walking the day after my surgery. And even with the hell I went through for 5 months, I'm am ready and willing to do it all over again. I'm sorry that it took so long.  I was saying that a c-section *requiring* two months of limited activity is not the case.  It can take longer for some people, but that doesn't mean that *everyone* is subject to at least two months of recovery time. I should also say that even though it took 5 months, and it was painful, and a pain in the ass to deal with daily wound changes, and not being able to pick anything up, or took forever to walk up stairs, it wasn't the end of the world. It didn't keep me from enjoying my newborn, it didn't stop me from doing as much as I could. And I'm glad to know that the next time I have a child it will be quick. Go in, get cut open, get baby, relax for a few days and go home! not only does that 50% seem way off, but can you tell me, is a c-section relatively safe? isn't the chance of a c-section causing death to mom or baby only in the case of an emergency c-section, in which case it's not even the c-section causing the chance of death, it's whatever complications that lead to it?  Your coworker sounds like a complete idiot. My mother has had 3 c-sections since her bones wouldn't spread enough for me or my siblings to be born naturally. \n\nPeople probably respond negatively to c-sections for a lot of different reasons. For me it has nothing to do with it being \"unnatural\". My mother told me about how painful the recovery is. You're on bed rest for a lot longer than if you could have had the baby naturally. When I think about how much work a newborn is -- I don't want to imagine trying to handle all of it with a huge painful incision on top of it. That's just me though.\n\nBut it's like you said, you're not even pregnant yet! You'll weigh all the pros and cons later with your doctor when it becomes important!\n\nIn all seriousness, I know that you just mentioned it in passing in a non-chalant kind of way to her (assuming that she wouldn't react like a total idiot) but the best way to deal with people like this is not to mention anything of importance to them at all.

She's right about that because it's dangerous for both mom and baby ([C-sections alter baby’s gut bacteria, may affect newborn’s lifelong health, Canadian study shows](http://www.canada.com/sections+alter+baby+bacteria+affect+newborn+lifelong+health+Canadian+study+shows/7948346/story.html)), but she was wrong about her approach. \n\nI had a c-section myself, because it was an emergency. And I consider it a natural birth. I do have some strange people that tried to tell me it wasn't \"natural,\" but what did they want us to do, die to make them happy?

I didn't downvote you, but just so you know saying your c-section was a \"natural birth\" not like all those other women having c-sections is kind of weird.  \n\nA c-section is natural like any medical procedure is natural.

That's what I got from your tone.  Was trying to explain the downvotes (and yes, I upvoted this comment). But I was careful to explicitly said that I consider it a natural birth! WTF. Unbelievable that I got downvoted for pointing out that I didn't say what you said I did. :( &gt; I was careful to explicitly said that I consider it a natural birth\n\nI'm guessing this is atypo? No why? Because it is saying that you DO consider a c-section a natural birth. I do, that's right. Astrea_M claimed I said that only my c-section was natural but nobody else's, but I didn't say that. I thought I was clear about saying I thought a c-section was just as natural as a vaginal birth.  But I was careful to explicitly said that I consider it a natural birth! WTF. Unbelievable that I got downvoted for pointing out that I didn't say what you said I did. :( AAAAND, you down voted me for pointing out why it happened &amp; upvoting you... while complaining about being downvoted.  I am amused. AAAAND, you totally made something up that I didn't say and then had the nerve to not only NOT apologize for making it up, but justified it as well. AAAAND then you blame me for getting downvotes.\n\nP R I C E L E S S  While I would recommend having vaginal if you can as a c-section seems drastic for someone who can do vaginal, it is up to you and talking to many sources about information regarding the safest way to have a kid. If 50% of mothers died giving birth through c-section it would be illegal.  I would not use a midwife who spouted these lies.  It is also dangerous to have your first birth in home and out of hospital/birthing center.  Most people go uncomplicated but for those who do not it is great to have a doctor.  C-sections can have their complications at a rate above vaginal, that is why they are meant to be second options.  Although they have started to trend to elective.  \n\nIt is similar to breast feeding. Yes, overall breast feeding is best. Although breast feeding may not be the best if the child is allergic to milk protein, PKU, you cannot produce milk, you have a disease that can be transmitted through breast milk, you cannot produce breast milk, you are on medications that can be transferred through breast milk and are important to your well-being, or the stress of breast feeding is overwhelming your ability to nurture you child.  Not breast feeding and having a c-section does not make you less of a mother or your baby less of a person.\n\nLike other's said, you will never be right and you will always be making the worst decision as a mother in other people's eyes.  So have your baby that you are planning.  At least you are planning to have/not have and asking outside biased confidants.  &gt;It is also dangerous to have your first birth in home and out of hospital/birthing center.\n\nI'm totally with you, except for that statement. Out-of-hospital births have excellent mortality and morbidity rates, completely on par with hospital births and much lower rates of infection, interventions, etc. Anyway, not the point of this post.\n\nIt's sad that people feel they can make commentary on how women choose to birth. No matter what you do, somebody is going to pass judgement. &gt;I'm totally with you, except for that statement. Out-of-hospital births have excellent mortality and morbidity rates, completely on par with hospital births and much lower rates of infection, interventions, etc. \n\nActually, an enormous [study](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/181/6-7/377.full) comparing *planned* home birth vs. hospital birth for demographically matched subjects in Canada found *lower* mortality and morbidity, to statistically significant levels, for the home birth group over both hospital groups (those birthing with midwives and those with OBs). And that counts in the \"planned hombirth\" group all the women who transferred from home to the hospital due to complications, too. Hey, I just read that study for class a couple weeks ago! Thank you. Have you seen any applicable studies for the US that are as large? There are so many obstacles for finding valid studies that aren't politically motivated. The legal restrictions on midwives carrying drugs, threat of arrest in many states...how can we even get the data? I'm excited about the work being done with MANA Stats. We can't get *this* data. The unique situation in Canada is, they use the *same* pool of midwives for hospital and home births. There's pretty much nowhere in the US where that happens, and in some places it's not even possible; only LPMs can do homebirths and only CNMs can do hospital births. We can't get *this* data.

CNMs can do home birth in the US, it's just not as common. Only like 5% of CNMs do home birth.   The woman has no idea what she's talking about but why did you bring it up with her if you don't want to hear her opinion on the matter?\n\nSeriously, especially if she has had a child and you have not, how do you think she feels hearing someone say \"oh wait maybe I do wanna have a kid, labor sounds like such a drag though, I think I'll just do it the more dangerous way so I won't have to do all that work.\" Especially when she had just done all that work?\n\nIts obviously not nearly as dangerous as she made it sound but it is riskier than vaginal birth. From this post it sounds like you came across as totally condescending and flippant. You and her BOTH were in the wrong. How it actually happened, since you're leaping to conclusions here:\n\nHer: Being a mother is going to be the best thing.\n\nMe: Yeah.  You know, I've never really wanted kids, but since seeing (our other coworker) with her baby, I think maybe I'll have kids one day.\n\nHer: Just make sure you find a good midwife.  And don't take xyz medications, they are so bad for you.\n\nMe: Maybe.  I'll probably do c-section, though.  I don't know if I can handle labor.\n\nHer: Yeah, if you want your baby to die.  Wait a second.\n\nOK, so first, she is atrociously misinformed. But regardless of that:\n\n&gt; I'm sorry, but this is a mythical child of the future that I have not even decided to have yet. \n\nDoesn't mean she cannot comment on your decisions.\n\n&gt; And secondly, it's none of her damn business if I have a c-section or not, it's something I'd want to talk to my doctor about and make my own informed decision about first.\n\nWell no shit sherlock. So if it's none of her business, why the fuck did you tell this to her to begin with? Why are you discussing this with coworkers if you are only prepared for a very specific, positive and agreeable reaction?..\n\n&gt; And just---this has made me so fucking angry for reasons I'm not entirely certain of. \n\nShe is a misinformed idiot, don't let her unqualified statements influence your emotions. &gt;Doesn't mean she cannot comment on your decisions.\n\nI'm not the OP.  But personally I am already INCREDIBLY tired of people who feel the need to comment on the fact that I am not going to have children by choice.  And I'm only 20 years old!  It is infuriating when people can't take my decisions as just that — **my** decisions.  Especially when they are a) misinformed or b) not someone I'd ask for advice, let alone from whom I'd appreciate unsolicited advice. &gt; But personally I am already INCREDIBLY tired of people who feel the need to comment on the fact that I am not going to have children by choice.\n\nThis is completely understandable, because, as you correctly said, these are personal medical decisions.\n\nHOWEVER. If you choose to speak to someone about these decisions - you therefore choose to hear their comments, and potentially criticism, about your decisions. If you don't want that - simply don't speak to them about it! Because like you said, it's not their business.\n\nThat's the issue with the OP's position. SHE mentioned it. She got a reaction. If she didn't want a reaction - which is completely reasonable if she doesn't, since it's her business and not others' - she should not have brought up the topic.\n\nIt's not reasonable to bring up a topic or a personal choice or something and then say \"You are not allowed to comment on this, at least negatively.\" If you discuss a topic, you welcome comments. Don't want comments - don't discuss the topic, that's all. Wait a second.\n\nOK, so first, she is atrociously misinformed. But regardless of that:\n\n&gt; I'm sorry, but this is a mythical child of the future that I have not even decided to have yet. \n\nDoesn't mean she cannot comment on your decisions.\n\n&gt; And secondly, it's none of her damn business if I have a c-section or not, it's something I'd want to talk to my doctor about and make my own informed decision about first.\n\nWell no shit sherlock.

I have one kid and am pregnant with #2. I wouldn't have a c-section unless it was an emergency. The recovery is more difficult and it carries all the potential complications of any other major abdominal surgery.\n\nBut it is ultimately up to you to decide. They are a lot safer than your coworker made them out to be. While more difficult to recover from, a c-section is not the end of the world. People have them every day. This.  It is MAJOR abdominal surgery.  Yes,  most people have few,  if any complications,  but,  after seeing a good friend develop a nasty infection in her incision and have to pack the wound with gauze for weeks,  no thanks.

No, that statistic she cited you is wrong.\n\n100% of people die.\n\nOn a slightly more serious note, people who deride women for getting c-sections because they aren't \"natural\" are ignorant. Walking upright and having a large cranium aren't \"natural\" either, and the female human pelvis has not fully caught up with these evolutionary developments, making \"natural\" childbirth for a lot of women tedious and excessively painful whereas virtually every other mammal is able to give birth quickly, some even while standing up.

There's a difference between a certified nurse midwife (who works in the hospital and has at least a master's degree) and a midwife who learned by apprenticeship or something unofficial of that sort.  Most people use the term \"midwife\" to mean CNM, and most CNMs will not do home birth.

    "title" : "My boyfriend of 3.5 years dumped me and then manipulated me into having sex with him again [trigger warning]",
    "snippet" : "For the past couple weeks, I've been struggling with my boyfriend of 3.5 years being apathetic and showing no interest in our relationship. This has happened from time to time, and we've always gotten over it after a short \"break.\" \nThis time, however, he dumped me. He told me he didn't have feelings for me anymore and that he thought he could do better and wanted to be single. I can understand this because I was his first girlfriend, and we're both in college and haven't really had time to explore.\nI gave him space and focused on myself and my friends for a week. We didn't talk, and I was really proud of myself for not making contact. I was actually enjoying being single and finding myself again. And then he texted me and told me he missed me. \nI asked him to come over because I wanted to chat in person. I planned to tell him that I was moving on but that I wanted to part on better terms. I wanted to tell him how toxic our relationship had been on me because I had no power in it. Instead, he said nice things (which was very rare for him), and we cuddled and agreed to try dating again on a trial period. I honestly wasn't completely feeling it, but I didn't want to regret not trying in the future. \nAnd then cuddling moved to making out. That was okay with me. When he started getting sexy, I told him that it wasn't a good idea for us to be intimate following such a nasty breakup and especially if we weren't sure we were going to work things out. He kept complimenting me and touching me in the places he knew would turn me on, telling me that he wanted to marry me and how beautiful I was. \nI believed him. I fucked him. And then he left and sent me a text saying he raped me and that he felt bad and that he didn't want to try getting back together. \n\nMy immediate response was \"No, that is ridiculous.\" However, he returned to his emotionless, asshole self the next day. We didn't talk all day even though I was supposed to come over later. When the time came around for me to hang out with him, I asked him if he still wanted me to come over. He said he didn't want to talk to me and that I wasn't coming over. \nThis hurt. I was starting to build my feelings back up in him. I had all these high hopes that he would honor my requests for flowers and courtship and be the boyfriend I had always hoped for. I hate myself for falling back in love so quickly. \nThat's when I started to question the rape thing. He used me. I was fine without him. I was healing from him all on my own, and then he had to go and fuck it all up. \n\nI can't focus on anything. I can't really tell any of my friends about this, either. He isn't a terrible guy, and I don't want him to get in trouble for anything. I do, however, want him to realize how terrible he has been to me and that no woman deserves to be stomped on emotionally or physically like he has done to me. \nI don't know what I expect from you ladies. I just needed to vent. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back to make edits and clarify things. It's 2:30 a.m. here, so my thoughts are not the most coherent at the moment.   You can't make him realize anything.\n\nYou can however, cut him totally out of your life.  Honestly, I personally don't think it was rape. You consented at the time. He may have deceived you about his future intentions with you, and he may have lied to you. But from what I got from what you've told us, is that you didn't object (you suggested it wasn't a good idea, but when things were getting hotter, you didn't outright tell him no) and he didn't force you to do anything. And it seems to me like he's manipulating you into thinking otherwise. You stated that HE suggested he raped you, but you didn't feel that way or come to that conclusion on your own.

    "title" : "I think I am having a panic attack. What do I do?",
    "snippet" : "This has never happened. I feel like I can't breath, my sides hurt like I'm going to puke, I feel like I'm going to pass out and it feels like some huge weight is crushing me and I can't escape. I have never dealt with this before ands I don't know what to do.    Oh man, just thinking about panic attacks is making me feel a little panicky. They're the worst! I feel your pain.\n\nFor me, it helps to go somewhere quiet, where I can be alone, and focus on my breathing. Sometimes I even shut my eyes to help me in centering myself. Sit down, make sure you're as comfy as can be, and just breathe. Try not to think about whatever has triggered this, or anything negative, and if you can't, try to think about things that make you feel good. I have this little imaginary oasis where I'm in a field of flowers that I go to when I'm in that position. \n\nHopefully, by the time you read this, it will already have passed.  It past, but now I am just really scared about this happening again. I really wish I could tell you that it won't, but ever since I've had my first one, it seems inevitable. It really helps to not dwell on it, or feel trapped by it, or let the fear of it consume you, and knowing that even if it happens, it will pass, and there are things you can do to take back control. Mind you, it doesn't happen to me \"a lot\" (in fact, I can count the number of times on one hand) so don't feel like this will be a weekly, monthly or even yearly thing. It past, but now I am just really scared about this happening again. Panic attacks are scary, I'm not going to tell you they aren't. But they also always pass. Always. If you feel one starting to come on, you can try the 'in through the nose, out through the mouth' thing, it will force to to slow down your breathing. If you're under a lot of stress, and you're starting to feel anxious more frequently, it might be a good idea to see a doctor. Being under a lot of stress for a long period of time can make you feel pretty crappy, but that's alright, it happens to a lot of us! What were you doing when this one started? So stupid. Sending a comment to someone else on 2x on how to deal with her situation since her and I went through basically the same thing, but to a different degree. I have never had a panic attack so I never even thought about it went I responded to the post. I'm not sure why this happened now because I am really open about what I went through and it has never been a problem before. Crying sure , but never a panic attack. Your body can react strangely to things. My first panic attack happened while I was sitting in class. I was just listening to the teacher talk, that was it. And then suddenly I couldn't breathe, and I had to leave class because I was starting to freak out for apparently no reason. When I talked to a doctor about it, she said you don't necessarily have to **feel** incredibly anxious to have an attack. Which, is great, I know, but it's not your fault, sometimes there really isn't a *reason* that you can point to and say \"Yes, this is why I am panicking!\"   When I have panic attacks, I tend to hyperventilate. If you're hyperventilating, find a brown paper bag and breathe into it. If you can't find one, use a pillowcase or t-shirt and breathe through it. Try to drink some water if you can.\n\nIs there someone with you who can help you out? No one is here and no one can get here.   Where are you right now? Is there someone you can call? A partner, family member, or doctor? I'm at home, everyone I know is at work or class right now. My parents would call me a baby for this and tell me to get over it. I'm sorry. Perhaps a pet to cuddle with?\n\nOther than contact with another being and breathing exercises, I've found that for me, the best thing to do is wait it out. Focus all of your mental energy on breathing. Do your best to shove whatever thoughts triggered this out of your head and concentrate on filling your lungs.\n\nI know how scary this is, but you'll be fine in a few minutes. Just minimize your thinking and maximize breathing. Ride this out. Is this going to happen a lot now? Can I prevent what just happened if it comes up again It depends on what caused it. If your mental health in general is shaky right now, then you might experience more attacks until you're a bit more stable. If it's a temporary situation that triggered it, it could be a one-time thing. It's unlikely that an attack will occur out of nowhere and for no reason, so if you can identify what caused this one, then dealing with that is going to help the most. For some frame of reference, I've had about ten panic attacks since I was 13. I'm almost 21. The first four were all in quick succession, because I was having pretty bad mental health issues. Since I started managing my mental health, attacks are rarer and easier to control. They tend to come in pairs for me because having one attack throws me off balance for a few weeks and I'm more vulnerable to another one. But that's only me--everyone experiences them differently.\n\nPanic attacks are triggered by different things for different people, so I can only speak from my own experience. I get attacks when I get into a dangerous state of mind. I get one negative thought and more keep popping into my head and growing and multiplying until I feel a sense of doom and horror. Once I get that feeling, an attack is inevitable, but if I'm able to let my partner know what's happening then he is wonderful at helping me get through it. Being with another person helps me know that I am not dying and that I will be fine because someone's watching out for me.\n\nThe only way I can prevent attacks is minimizing bad thoughts and eliminating stress that causes those thoughts. If I'm getting bad thoughts and feel them starting to build up, I try to distract myself, run around the room, splash water on my face, tell myself a story out loud, blare music, sing, scream, whatever I can do to take my mind off of it.\n\nTry not to think about it too much right now, though. Panic attacks are exhausting and I recommend you chill out and recover. Try to take a nap or watch some mindless, entertaining TV for a bit. You can address this once you're feeling calmer. Is this going to happen a lot now? Can I prevent what just happened if it comes up again    [deleted]",

    "snippet" : "Ok... I need to talk to someone else besides my partner and need the help of all you lovelies on TwoX...\n\nSo....I'll give a bit of a depressing and frustrating (for me) background first. I'll just lay it out on the table: when I was a kid I was sexually abused by a very close family member. The abuse lasted about 3-4 months and my family visited this family member almost every weekend. I hadn't hit puberty yet and it was a very, very, very confusing time in my life. \n\nThe reason I need to vent is because that family never died this week and I feel terrible that I'm happy... My mom is absolutely devastated because the person that passed was in her immediate family. While she knows what happened to me, she still felt a bit sad to cut ties with the abuser because they were diagnosed with cancer. Now I feel bad because I can't really make my mom feel better without feeling like crap myself. \n\nI feel like such a mean person to be happy at the death of someone who was supposed to care for me. It's a very confusing and frustrating situation. I really feel bad for my partner, too because he doesn't even know what to do... Ugh.. I feel happy, disgusting, relieved, and shell shocked all at the same time... I don't even want to go to the funeral because I couldn't bring myself to see their lifeless body and hear people say how great of a person they were. To me, this person was terrible.... I could really use some support and maybe some guidance... The other thing that sucks is I can't afford to see a specialist because my insurance through my mom sucks (I'm 23) and I just lost my temp job that was paying the bills. I just don't know what to do or what to say to my mom... What do I do, TwoX?\n\nTL;DR: I was sexually abused by a family member and I'm happy that they died this week.

    "snippet" : "I hope this doesn't sound stupid but I feel very confused/angry/stupid right now.\n\nI got on the bus, as I do every morning, and as there were no seats I had to stand in the aisle. I noticed the man seated alongside me checked me out as I was walking on, but I didn't really think anything of it.\n\nIt's only a short bus ride but a few minutes into it I felt his leg against mine, just kinda bumping it every now and then. After that I felt his legs closer to mine, so  I just moved forward as much as I could in case he needed to get up/move/etc. The next thing I knew, he stood up and was behind me. He then started getting very close to me and when the bus bumped, his body (including his crotch) would bump against mine and he would hold it against me, and his hands would subtly brush against me when he went to grab the things to hold on to (I can't think of what they're called, but the things you hold on to on buses lol). When his crotch pressed against me I could 100% feel he was \"aroused\". To be honest, it reminded me of those pr0n videos with the girl on the bus and the guy keeps bumping her and then they get it on.\n\nLuckily the bus came to a stop and enough people got off that there was finally enough room for movement, so I \"accidentally\" flung my handbag back so it hit him and then I moved up to sit next to the biggest man I could see, and the weirdo followed and sat opposite of me and readjusted his pants a few times (in the downstairs department). At this point I realised it wasn't my mind playing tricks on me, and this guy actually was being creepy and if he followed me when I got off I'd either have to fight him or ask someone to walk with me (and possibly look like an idiot?). Thankfully when I got off he just stared at me and didn't follow.\n\nI'm not sure what to think now, I'm sure I'm overreacting as it's nothing major compared to what a lot of other people have gone through, but I just feel sick about the whole incident and I'm not sure what to do/how to feel. I feel like maybe it's my own fault for wearing a low-ish cut top which I'm sure is what initially got his attention, and I feel stupid for not making a big deal about it when it happened. Am I overreacting??\n\nThanks for reading.\n  No way your fault.

What a horrible man, I understand why you feel sick and violated. You need to get this off your chest as you didn't get a chance to shout at the person responsible. You should rage about it to someone in your life to get rid of that sick feeling, it's horrible what happened to you and you shouldn't feel you have to downplay it. Anything like this happens again and make sure you publicly shame them by speaking loudly and calling them out.   Thank you for your understanding. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to get home from work so I can tell him which will hopefully make me feel a bit better.   If it were me, I'd have taken a camera shot of him and taken it to the police to make a report. Hindsight is 20/20, though.   No one has said this yet, you need to report the incident to the bus company. Give them as many details as possible, the route you were on, what time you got on &amp; got off, where he was sitting &amp; what you did to stop it. \n\nIf he's on the bus again tell the driver of what he did, point him out. My boyfriend wants me to report it but can understand why I'm hesitant... I agree that I should report it to the bus company but as I didn't make a scene I'm just afraid it'll look like I've just made it up. My boyfriend wants me to report it but can understand why I'm hesitant... I agree that I should report it to the bus company but as I didn't make a scene I'm just afraid it'll look like I've just made it up.  This happened to me once on the train when I was in high school. I smacked him right in the face with my super thick 5-pound math textbook.    Happened to me 2 or 3 times, on the subway during rush hour so I couldn't move. I ended up trying to lean away from him so much I was practically on top of the lady seated in front of me (we were standing). Disgusting. I should have reported it, because when I got off at my stop, he switched to the subway going in the other direction, probably to prey on someone else.  Sorry to hear about your experiences :(        Not at all your fault. No need to make a big deal of it, but if you find this guy doing this again, notify the bus driver so the guy can be flagged. \"No need to make a big deal of it.\" Nice try guy on the bus.. Not at all your fault. No need to make a big deal of it, but if you find this guy doing this again, notify the bus driver so the guy can be flagged.  [deleted] OP said that at first she didn't know if the guy was being creepy or not.  People behave ambiguously at times...\"Is the guy next to me just trying to stretch his legs?  Or is he trying to get closer to me?\"\n\nOnce she determined that it was indeed creep behavior, she may have been too shocked to speak up for herself in the moment.\n\nWomen in general are not socialized to speak up for themselves.  This socialization is covert and ongoing. OP's experience is a perfect example of why this mentality does nothing for women.\n\nAs a man you can help by being aware of what your body is doing in public spaces.  One thing I always wondered is why some men have to sit on the bus/subway with their legs stretched soooo w i d e.  Take up a reasonable amount of space, guys.",

    "title" : "Question in regards to abortion. Hope this is an okay subreddit for this. ",
    "snippet" : "Before I even start to explain, I know the way Ive gone about this unwanted pregnancy so far has probably been really, really stupid. I know I should have been more careful to begin with as well. \n\nA little over a month ago I began to suspect I was pregnant. Me and my boyfriend ta;lked over our options and, being two adults of very low income, who have rent and bills to pay and who are still trying to fund school when we can, we decided abortion was the most responsible route to correct an irresponsible mistake. \n\nI took a pregnancy test, confirmed what I feared, and then began researching my options as far as getting an abortion goes. I called around and it seems I cant find a clinic to accept my insurance, I couldnt find a single clinic that would agree to bill me so i could pay back one or two hundred every few weeks, and I sinly dont have the five hundred dollars up front, and honestly, probably wont for a while. We've been living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nSo this is where it gets really dumb and not very well thought out. I started desperately researching my options on the internet. The pill they use to induce abortions at home are called Misoprostol. It appears a lot of women, some in the same situation (poor) and some living in countries where abortion is illegal, have used this without the aid of a doctor with good results. \n\nSo of course Im not going to say how, but I got my hand on four of these pills and did as all these other women did. I slipped them under my tongue, let them dissolve, and then endured about 10 hours of the most horrific pain Ive ever experienced. At times I passed medium sized blod clots, but there was never really any very heavy bleeding and for the next three days or so I had some light spotting. \n\nFast foward about a month. I have no pregnancy symptoms anymore, aside from my boobs not having shrunk down yet (they arent sore anymore though...) but my pregancy tests are still showing a positive result. \n\nSo I made an appointment for the clinic this Friday, what I should have done to begin with. I dont know where Im getting the money from, but Ill sell every electronic I own if I have to. At this point its too late for a medical abortion, so I had to make the appointment for a surgical abortion. My questions are these :\n\nCan I get in trouble if I tell them what happened?\n\nIs it possible the first attempt was a success and Im just still dealing with the pregnancy hormone, making the test show up positive a month later?\n\nWill they do an ultrasound first?\n\nDoes anyone know of any funding for low income women to aid them with this sort of thing? \n\nThanks for reading this guys, I hope I can find some answers.

Rather than dismiss the metaphor, just look at how \"locks\" and \"keys\" work in modern cryptosystems. A lock that any key can open is VERY useful. A key that can open any lock is a threat to the entire system. Wait... all you're doing is repeating the metaphor. They tried to reverse it. In this case, a key that can open any lock is bad/dangerous, a lock that can be opened by any key is really useful. Unfortunately, I don't know anything about cryptosystems.",

    "title" : "Help with \"mom\" jeans",
    "snippet" : "This past weekend, I went through all my drawers and tried on every pair of jeans I own. I had a third party present to judge, and it is as I feared: most of the jeans I have are \"mom\" jeans. I'm 22 years old, and I've lost about 20 lbs in the past year, which I think may have contributed to the jeans being saggy in the butt, but it's not just that.\n\nHow do I avoid purchasing mom jeans? I don't even know I'm wearing them, but I've been told multiple times that I often do, and I just really don't know what to look for. Thanks in advance!  \"Mom jeans\" happen when the rise in the waist is too high. Look for jeans that sit lower on your hips and are tight through the thigh.  I second this. But as a lady with a large rump, I also want to add a word of caution. If you're well-endowed in the bum, lower waisted jeans can show a bit too much, especially when crouching, bending over, climbing stairs, etc. Because of this, I usually stick with my mom jeans.   Darker washes, mid rise, and go for fitted styles like boot cut or skinny (depends on your body shape but if you are curvy boot cut is better and tends to be universally flattering).  Get something that fits you well and is snugger to your butt and thighs without being tight.  I'll throw some examples of styles that tend to be pretty flattering and not at all \"Mom jeans\".\n\n*  The jean wardrobe staple is a good fitting pair of [dark wash bootcut jeans](http://img3.targetimg3.com/wcsstore/TargetSAS//img/p/14/46/14466206_130206003000.jpg).  The dark solid color and the slight flare in the leg makes these damn near universally flattering.  A style like this can be worn on any size and for women at any age.  My 54 year old mom can wear pants like this and took put together and I can wear the same ones at 22 and still look great. You can play with the wash too if you like and do a pair like [this](http://img2.targetimg2.com/wcsstore/TargetSAS//img/p/14/46/14466344_130206003000.jpg).\n\n*  Lighter jeans can be worn but you need the right wash and good fit of course, [here](http://img2.targetimg2.com/wcsstore/TargetSAS//img/p/14/24/14245164_121221120000.jpg) is a non-\"mom\" jean lighter wash.\n\n*  Skinny jeans if they fit poorly can be more likely to be unflattering, especially if you are pair shaped since they do tend to emphasize the hips a bit more (which makes them good for women looking to make their hips look wider for a curvier look).

    "title" : "Disney, Hollywood and a Motorcycle",
    "snippet" : "When I started dating seriously in my early twenties, I was looking for a husband. I'll be honest with you, I was looking for someone with a good work ethic, who had a thoughtful upbringing. Someone who received a good education, something that they could apply to the work force. Someone who could support a family someday. I wanted a partner, not a boyfriend.\n\nI was, like many others, raised in an era of Disney princesses, Hollywood domestic failures, and the Nicholas Sparks novel destiny of finding something in between.\n\nWhen I started dating seriously, people told me not to think I was a Disney princess. There is no prince charming. Every man has his flaws, you're going to have to suffer with him and through them. I thought that seemed reasonable. I settled with that conclusion. Maybe that's where this started.\n\nThis started with a relationship where my partner slept with one of his students. I decided that wasn't good enough. When I left, I was criticized in the community. I was young. I was very young now that I think about it in a grander scheme, but we all learn. I went through a revolving door of charmers until one day I met a man on a motorcycle. He had everything. A good job, an education, a home, a sense of adventure (but not too much, enough that we'd drive away for the weekend but never that we'd forget our cell phones). He had been a serial monogamist his whole life, he was older than me, and we were in love. I was smitten.\n\n\nThat's when he started punching walls. He'd had tantrums in the past, but you know, thick and thin. No one's perfect. He'd never hurt me. He just needed his space, you know? I'd go away for the weekend and see my parents. It felt like Disney most of the time and Hollywood once in a while. It wasn't ever supposed to be Disney, I was told, so I thought that I had a pretty good batting average at this point.\n\n\nWe were together for years. Until I found out he had read everything in my computer, followed me when we were apart for just a few hours, ket tabs on my emails, spending, phone calls and texts. One day he came home at lunch and lost it on me for some misunderstanding. He called me all kinds of names. He threatened me. After two hours, he left and I called my mom. She told me I needed to come home, and so I did.\n\nNow this is long in the past and I'm happier. I found someone who isn't prince charming either. He takes long showers and puts the coffee grounds down the sink. Once he even put ghee in the dishwasher. He can't cook, but he's brilliant. He makes me laugh. We aren't perfect. But we're nice to each other and we're happy.\nMister not so nice is still alone. He drives by my new house once in a while. Today, what sparked me to write this, was I was at a coffee shop and he drove past me on that old alluring motorcycle four times. He still tries to intimidate me now, all this time later.\n\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that even though you're told not to expect Disney, do. Expect some Disney. But don't ever put up with any Hollywood. You probably will at some point in your life. It'll help you grow. Experiences will never take away from the person that you are.\n     ",

    "title" : "Dad died, Mom tried suicide a year ago.  Now she says she \"can't be left alone\".  Since I'm unmarried she insists that I stay at her house or she stay at mine",
    "snippet" : "I'm the only kid she has within a 400 mile radius (and one of only 2 without kids of my own).\n\nIf I refuse to stay with her she also calls, texts, comes over unannounced, and goes into meltdown whenever I have plans that don't include her, and has campaigned all my relatives to convince me to move in with her.  \"It'll save you money!\"  \"You're not married!\"  \"You're ungrateful for not taking her up on her offer!\"  I am SICK of this, I feel sorry for her but this is seriously starting to affect my personal life:  dating, and even work.\n\nYes, she is on medication for depression and is in therapy.  I went with her to a \"family session\", and it seems she is (typical her) lying to her therapist about her feelings.  \"Everything's fine, I'm perfectly happy!\"  She really has him fooled, when I tried to interject he told me I \"didn't like seeing her recover\".  BULLSHIT, I'd like to have my life back, please.\n\nAnd now that I get a chance to say it, I'm tired of walking on eggshells around her.  Dad was a big, burly guy with a white beard, rode a motorcycle, so now anytime she sees a motorcycle or a big burly guy with a white beard, prepare for an hour-long crying bout.  Christmas was hell (think Santa Claus).  I feel like my own grieving process is getting shelved.  I can't stand to stay in the house where he was.  She can't stand to leave.\n\nIf I make plans that don't include her (such as a date), she'll cry that she doesn't have any friends, I'm all she has.  I've tried to get her to go out, she won't do it on her own (there's robbers!) and she's OK to date but there's very few single men her age around here, she won't go to bars (nothing but drunks!) and she won't find men on the Internet (that's where rapists find their victims!)\n\nShe attends church, she belongs to a gym, but she won't talk to anyone at either place.  How can I get her to either a) find some friends of her own, or b) leave me the hell alone?  It's been a YEAR.  I am sick of putting my life on hold for her.\n\n**UPDATE**:  I live about 20 minutes away from her.  I am 28, she is 47.  Dad died in a violent car accident, very sudden and unexpected - none of us got to say goodbye.  I have 3 brothers, 1 sister; they all sort of blame her for Dad's death (they had a big fight before he got on the road, he probably wasn't paying attention, yada yada) and none of them have come around since the funeral.  (The 3 brothers are on the side of telling me I should move in with her!)  \n\nYes I do feel guilt at also leaving her to herself; I wish there was a way to make her see reason and try LIVING again, rather than having a tear-filled conversation about how I'm keeping away from her to keep my sanity.  I've tried setting boundaries before; she just barrel-rolls right over them (\"Oh I forgot you told me to call before I came over.  Well now that I'm here, I'll just do a little vacuuming, oh you just did?  Nonsense, it looks terrible, I better do it again.\"  \"I know you told me not to bother you at work, but I cooked all day just to bring you this casserole.\")\n\nI am going to find some bereavement groups for her.  She never went to one, I guess we all thought that seeing a therapist would be enough.    Just based on my personal experience with this type of behavior, I would switch to the approach that you do the following:\n\n1. Advise her that if she makes any threats of self-harm and will not deny their credibility, you are going to have to alert her therapist and/or the police for her own protection. \n\n2. You love her and of course enjoy visiting with her, but right now you will not be moving into her home.\n\n3. You are available on x day every week/other week/month or whatever, and you're open to any type of plans she would like to make during your visits. \n\n4. If she persists in insisting that someone must be present for her all the time for safety purposes, offer to research facilities with assisted living services or home-care nurses to help her. \n\nYou have got to set boundaries with her for your own protection.   I'm sorry but English is not my first language (this is my friend's reddit account), what is \"will not deny their credibility\"?  Can you explain please? I'm sorry but English is not my first language (this is my friend's reddit account), what is \"will not deny their credibility\"?  Can you explain please?  Rather than going to family therapy with her therapist, can you ask him to refer you to a neutral therapist (one that does not treat one of you individually)?  Or can you go to her church leader for support to get her involved in church function and let you live a life?  I feel you will need a mediator if she is threatening you to keep you there.  I second the neutral therapist idea.  We have no idea what she might have told her personal therapist about you before you two went to the family therapy session that gave him the impression that you \"didn't like seeing her recover\".\n\nIf the neutral therapist tells her something she doesn't like, however, I can totally see her trying to make claims that they were unsympathetic to her plight, didn't listen to her side of the story, etc.  I would suggest letting her pick the therapist (so she can't say \"you picked someone that thinks like you\" or whatever), and if she ends up unhappy with what they tell her then let her pick another one - until she realizes that they are telling her the truth, as much as she may dislike it.  Also, make sure to inform the neutral therapist that you are specifically going to them because neither of you are previous clients of theirs and you want an unbiased opinion.  That way if she tries to make an appointment with them privately to get more time to tell her story, they'll know what's up.   I kinda dealt with this.  I heartily recommend getting an \"AWESOME job, 12 states away\"...  \n\nIn the end your mother is acting incredibly possessive and juvenile.

These last two weeks have been a really bad relapse for me (in case you missed the trigger warning, here's another one.) \n\nAnyways, I've been at around 400-600 calories a day a few hours at the gym daily and making myself ill whenever I eat something \"unsafe\". I've already dropped around 10lbs (4.5 Kg) My boyfriend doesn't know about my eating disorder. I've only been seeing him for about 4 months and this is my first relapse. \n\nI was feeling like shit, and right when I was at my lowest on friday night, an ex calls and asked if I wanted to come and watch a movie.

And... we did. \n\nThe next morning my boyfriend had planned to drive up and see me (he lives about 45 minutes away, I see him twice a week) and I told him everything. he was hurt, but he said he loves me and wants to work through it.

Go to the student health center, see if there are mental health services, this isn't something you should have to go through alone some days I want to, really, but other days, this relapse feels like the best thing that's ever happened to me. I know that sounds awful, but I'm just not to the \"getting help\" stage of things yet.  Then please don't put your boyfriend through this. He most likely does not have training as a therapist and you are currently hurting him by not dealing with this issue. I can't claim to know what going through an eating disorder is like but I can claim what it's like to be the significant other of someone who refuses to help themselves and uses you as a crutch. It's not fair to him.  Thanks. I needed to hear  that. I called the counseling center and they scheduled me an appointment for two weeks away. It's not much but I think that's a start.  ",

    "snippet" : "I'm essentially living in hell right now. It's almost March 2013. We first learned about my dad's affair in late 2011. My mother is more or less in the same emotional state now as she was back then. Absolutely no progress has been made. \n\nIt's all very back-and-forth. He'll be home, he'll be gone. My mom gets her hopes up every time he's home only to be crushed when he inevitably leaves again. She briefly changed her behavior a while ago (stopped trying to call and text him so much, started doing her own thing) and it seemed to help. Only now he's gone again and she's been crying to me all day and I don't know what to do.\n\nI see the same patterns. He comes home, she's all happy for a while. Then she gets suspicious that the affair isn't really over (it never is) and starts questioning him. He gets mad, blows up, sometimes tries to get physical with her, and eventually takes off again.\n\nIt's stuck in an endless cycle and it's causing strain for all of us. My brother is acting out worse than ever. He's almost 16 and has terrible anger issues. He's suspected to be bipolar or possibly on the autism spectrum, but has never been diagnosed because he refused to talk to any professional when my parents did try to get him help. My brother has been yelling at my mom, calling her horrible names, threatening to hurt her and the dog, saying he hopes she dies. Terrible things. I get that he's pretty screwed up because of what is going on, but it's just not acceptable. \n\nMore context: I graduated from college in Spring 2012. I still don't have regular work and am running out of money fast. Living at home is causing strain on my anxiety disorder. I'm in therapy to try to deal with everything, but every day is still a struggle. When I look at jobs that would require me to move out, my mother starts crying that I'm abandoning her just like everyone else. I didn't get any of those jobs I applied for anyway.\n\nI don't know what to do. My mother is refusing to look for a job because she says if I can't find one, she won't be able to find one. (Meanwhile my dad is now trying to demand she gets a job, and not just a minimum wage one because we \"need\" money. My dad makes good money. He's merely been spending all of it on frivolous things.) \n\nMom refuses to file for divorce because she's super fundamentalist Christian and believes that divorcing my dad will mean that she's going to hell and \"cursing\" the family as well. \n\nShe keeps telling me to do something about it and to take a stand to my dad, but with my dad's temper I'm afraid that would do more damage than good. \n\nBasically I'm stuck. She's stuck. I'm out of ideas.  ",

I want to know I'm not alone.  Good god yes, in only the past 6 months, I was so desperate for new bras that he spent over £150 (about $230) on them and then his parents paid for a deposit on a flat because I couldn't afford to.\n\nOddly, he is embarrassed to have money. I am uncomfortable about receiving it. I understand being embarrassed about money. I didn't earn it, and while my lifestyle is by no means opulent, it's still kinda nice.    I'm in the opposite situation right now :/\n\nWe're both in college, but my family is super well off and pays for everything, while he has to do it all himself.  He says that he worries that I'll be unhappy if he doesn't shower me with gifts, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\nHe's an art major, and I'd much rather him make me something than go out and buy me gifts, or cook me dinner (like I'm doing for him tonight) than go to a fancy shmancy restaurant.  Blah. I feel like you relationship is probably more difficult on him than many of the ones posted here, because there are hundreds of years of \"the man must provide for the woman\" beating down on his head. Best of luck, and good luck working things out!\n\nBe careful though - I dated a guy when I was in high school (he was graduated from high school and working) who thought he needed to shower me with gifts that he REALLY couldn't afford. I would demure, then try to decline, then actually decline, then YELL AT HIM because he was in over his head in debt, truly didn't have the money, borrowed and \"borrowed\" from his friends, and kept trying to pretend that he could spoil me with things I didn't want or need. Eventually, I had to break it off. For his sake. When after lots of trying I couldn't get through to him, either he wasn't listening to me, was listening but didn't respect me enough to oblige, or was just too immature to handle money. I couldn't be unequally yoked.\n\nNot saying that your situation is that dramatic. But be careful.  I don't simply because he is fortunate enough to get very good money for doing something he absolutely loves (ie: he'd do it for free).

However, I am now a stay-at-home-parent and it was a HUGE transition for me to not be making my own money. Huge.   I've been struggling with it a lot. He has a job in a career that pays a ton. The particular career I chose doesn't pay nearly as well. I don't know exactly how much he makes, but if it's anywhere near the average I've seen online he makes 4x the amount I do. It's not a big deal except in one way - he loves to have the best of everything, and he can afford it. I also would love to have the best of everything, but I can't afford that. He's said more than once that he'd like to see me in shoes and clothes WAY out of my price range. He wants me to \"match\" him, and it's frustrating to me. His money is the last thing I want out of our relationship, but I would love to dress like that too... and if he wants it so bad, I wish he would buy some things for me instead of complaining about it and not listening when I say I can't afford it. Wait, if I understand correctly - he makes more than you and complains that you don't dress in a way that matches him, knowing fully that you earn less? That's exactly the situation. It baffles me too. :( This makes me sad. Hugs.  Thanks for the hugs. It makes me sad too... our relationship is kind of dysfunctional, and the clothing/money issue is just a display of a larger problem. He won't fully commit to me, and me not being \"good enough\" in one way or another is the excuse he uses. I don't want to pry, but have you guys talked about this? Without knowing much about your situation, you sound *really* unhappy, and that concerns me a little bit. It sounds like your issues run deeper than just clothes.  We've talked about it numerous times. I'm feeling pretty upset about our situation today, so that's probably coming through in my comments. I'm sure another talk is coming soon, probably as soon as I can articulate what I'm feeling and thinking.

He's so shallow about the brands of clothing and footwear that you wear, that he harasses you about it rather than just loving you as you are. He's selfish enough that though he knows that you make far less than he does, he isn't willing to buy you these clothes that matter so much to him. (I'm not saying you should ask him to.)\n\nFrom your other comments, he won't commit because he thinks you're beneath him, and you've talked about this more than once with no change for the better?\n\nHoney, you really need to consider getting out. Can we have more info? How long have you been together? What's your history?  Yep. My boyfriend makes 3-4x as much as I do now. He pays most of the bills and I try to contribute when I can, with utilities and groceries. I also have student loans to pay back, whereas he doesn't.\n\nLast year I tried to make a grand gesture and pay for a week long trip to two different destinations, which I thought was well within my budget. But of course the next month was tax month and it turned out that I owed a LOT more in taxes than I expected. Ever since then, I have just been so much more worse off because anything I had managed to save just went away. I hate my job so much more and it's so inconsistent, plus I'm spending a lot of time looking for another job. It's all very stressful and disheartening. I wish I could make just half of what my boyfriend makes. I am just not making a liveable wage at all, but I don't want to keep this job so I don't see a point in committing to more work and/or a promotion if I'm just going to quit. And even if I don't quit, I just hate it with a burning passion. It's so frustrating. Wow. You just described my situation almost exactly. I don't have much to add other than you're not alone! It absolutely sucks being poor while your other half is far from it. I am also searching for a new job. Good luck to you!   [deleted]  **Sorry, this is a wall of text. But if anyone would care to read and reply, I would really appreciate it.**\n\nIt's very upsetting. My boyfriend and I have been together for about two years. Started dating his last year of undergrad, now he's in his second year of professional school. I work all year long, usually two jobs at once in addition to school. He only works during the summers, as school is very time-consuming. He makes more in the summer than I do all year long. And when we graduate, I'll be in a very satisfying but low-paying field, while he will be doing quite well. Probably making about 4x what I do. \n\nWe both agree that if we were to have kids, we'd want a parent to be home to raise them, particularly when they're younger. And both our career outlooks and social conventions are saying that I should be the one to be the stay-at-home parent. I'm not opposed to that. I'd be a great mom, and he and I would like to farm a bit, which would require some time during the day that he wouldn't have. I would absolutely be contributing. If our career outlooks would be reversed, I would happily let him be the stay-at-home dad. It just makes more sense this way.\n\nI just feel like a freakin' freeloader, like some bitch who is in it for her MRS degree. Oh, how convenient that I'm dating someone with such great prospects! I will definitely get my Master's and possibly my PhD before starting a family (yeah bitchez, we'll both be called Doctor!), but even then the jobs in my field are lower-paying than his. Once I get my PhD, it'll probably be time to start poppin' out little'uns before my age makes the risks too high, and then what? Will I have a pretty little degree on the wall and never make use of it?\n\nI feel like best case scenario, I'll end up teaching at a community college. It's just so hard to push out the research that big universities want, and I would be many years out of the game by the point that I could. Nothing wrong with community college, but I want to do science.\n\nAnd if something happens where I never get my PhD, then I won't even have a title equal to his. He's got no problems with it (he was the one who brought up the idea of me being a stay-at-home mom). But I just never saw myself as someone who would rely on her husband to carry the weight. Heck, I should be terrified of it, as my mom had a solid, but not lavish salary and still got financially fucked when my parents divorced! I would be even more dependent on my husband. (For many reasons, I am not actually worried about this.)\n\nHe views and treats me as an equal, even though I'm doing worse in undergrad, making less money during undergrad, and taking longer in undergrad than he did.

I'm in nearly the same situation, except that he only has a Masters and I've finished my PhD quals... so we'll be the Doctor and the Master when I'm done. Unfortunately, his degree is in engineering, and mine is in something that while not wholly unpractical is not something most people have a grasp of... they're like... \"And what are you going to do with that?\"\n\nMy employment prospects aren't great in the general location he has a job in, and I do think it's important for kids to have a parent at home (also, day-care in this area sucks badly), but I can't reconcile myself to the reality of the situation even though I accept that it's the logical conclusion. I feel inferior. I don't think that I can spend \"his\" money... so I don't buy food when I'm at school if I can help it, and just eat well on the weekends when I'm home with him. It's ludicrous, and I know it's all me (he's very very nice about it) but I can't get over it either.   my fiance buys me stuff all the time, little things but they add up. He does it because I'm supporting 3 people on part-time pay.\n \nIt didn't really bug me until Christmas. I got him a few small things that he wanted (favorite body wash, breath-right strips etc). \n\nThen he brings out the package...it was the dress I wanted for our wedding! \n\nWhile sweet I felt bad because I couldn't give him something like that without major saving and sacrifices on my part.  That is about the most romantic gesture I've ever seen. He loves you, he respects you for your kindness and generosity, and he wants you to be happy as you can be on your wedding day. That's beautiful.\n\nI'm going to guess he's not the type to hold it over your head. Just remember that you can contribute in nonfinancial ways. If taking care of you makes him happy, that's money well spent.\n\nI say this, but I also [posted on this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/195gw2/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_their_so_being_far/c8l45s4) :/ And our disparity isn't that great, so I probably have no idea what I'm talking about.  You are not alone in the discomfort. My husband makes twice as much as I do. He just dropped well over $1K on a new bumper for my Jeep. I'm appreciative and happy with my gift, but I feel funny because I can't spend that kind of money on myself. (I can, but can't justify it.) A new bumper sounds like a necessity and not something requiring justification.   Depends on what \"I can, but can't justify it\" means. It could mean something like \"I technically have this sum in my possession but I have more pressing needs, like food and bills and rent\" or \"I could spend the money on a bumper but I'd have to be frugal for the next month and my job's only around the corner, meh, may as well walk\". She specifically stated that she can afford it. Additionally, functioning bumpers are required by law for safety reasons (not necessarily the driver's, but more specifically the public's in general).  So in other words, she couldn't justify spending money that she had on maintaining her responsibility for the general public's safety.     Yes. It makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nTo clarify: he doesn't make that much money--he's a high school English teacher, there's quite an age difference--but I'm in college, and I make basically no money. I make enough money to scrape together $100 to buy wine and groceries for us when he visits me, and then I just try to make it for the rest of the month on $50 or so. Until I accidentally let it slip one night, he didn't realize it was so tough for me. Since then he's started buying groceries and bringing them to my apartment when he makes the trip here for the weekend. \n\nIn what seems to me a very conspicuous move, although he never ever mentions it or makes me feel badly about it, he always deliberately buys more than we can eat in a weekend and just stocks my shelves with canned soup and fresh produce. It's so nice, but it makes me feel a little sick. Not only are we 11 years apart, not only is he working on a limited teacher's salary, but I'm left feeling a little like a charity case. So there's a bit of a power differential here, age-wise and financially, that I've tried so many times to quell--\"Don't buy this many groceries, I'm fine, I don't need this!\"--but I can tell he's worried and wants to provide for me. \n\nI'm graduating in a year, and I have many, many prospects for fairly high-paying jobs in a big city post-graduation. It won't be like this forever, but I hate feeling like he's constantly concerned about how I'm making do and whether he needs to help me out. \n\nI'm not in dire straits--$150-200/month lasts me a looong time, I'm quite frugal, and I also get one free meal a day at the campus dining hall with my scholarship. I typically load up a to-go box with food and nibble on it throughout the day. I just feel a need to go above and beyond when he drives 3 hours to visit me, and it's caused a bit of a strain. \n\ntl;dr: I'm dating an older guy who doesn't make much, but makes more than me. It definitely makes me feel a little weird.  He sounds like he's being very sweet about trying to help you out without you losing face. As you said, it won't last forever, so that should help with the uncomfortableness of it all until then.  Yes. It makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nTo clarify: he doesn't make that much money--he's a high school English teacher, there's quite an age difference--but I'm in college, and I make basically no money.

Your BF is not in your face trying to \"oppress\" you.  He cares about you and is trying to help you without embarrassing you.  Quite honestly, its disgusting that you would take this jester and push it back on him.  Do you feel the same way about the people who funded the scholarships that you mention?  Are they making you feel the power differential because they can afford to donate to help others and you are at their mercy for your education and thus your future?  Honestly, I wrote thank you letters to the foundations and individuals who paid for my education through scholarships, and I think that any decent person would feel the need to do the same.  Maybe you should find it in yourself to thank your BF as well instead of feeling \"oppressed.\" [deleted] I think that your BF tried to address the power differential that you mention by doing this without bringing it up.

Maybe you should find it in yourself to thank your BF as well instead of feeling \"oppressed.\" Oh, I think you might have misunderstood--maybe I wasn't clear. I don't feel oppressed by him at all, and, in fact, in my original post, I never used the word \"oppressed\". I am very, very thankful for him: not only for the kind, subtle, generous things he does to help me out, but also for our easy companionship, his endless affection, our incredible connection. I thank him every day for the things he does for me and for the love that he goes out of his way to demonstrate. I love him, and I want him to see me as a self-sufficient, capable adult. I'm 21 and he's 32, and it's important to me that he sees me as a woman and not a kid. When he helps me out in this way, I am so incredibly grateful and so incredibly in love with him, but I do feel a bit of guilt because I'm not fulfilling my end of the \"adult bargain\", whatever that may mean. I'm not saying this is a justified way to feel, or that I'm objectively right. I'm just saying that I feel a little guilty and sad that I can't provide those things for myself all the time, which I think is exactly the kind of thing that OP was asking for.  I apologize if I misunderstood and was brash.  When you mentioned the, \"power differential,\"  I assumed that you were the one feeling oppressed.  Am I to understand that your being younger and making less money oppresses him?  If not, then I must not understand the definition of the phrase, \"power differential.\"  My understanding is that if there is a binary system and one is more powerful than the other, then, by definition, the other party is oppressed.  That was the meaning that I took from the context of your statement on, \"power differential.\"\n\nMoving on, I ask again:  Do you feel guilt for the scholarships that you receive?  You see part of being an adult is understanding that you will not always have everything and that you will go through trials and tribulations.  You will have periods where you may not be able to help yourself and require the help of others.  In turn, you will be required to help those whom you love in your life when the need it.  It is a complete misconception that many youth have that adults are all self-sufficient and capable 100% of the time.  All responsible adults strive for that, but there are often mitigating circumstances.  You should not feel guilt for the position that you are in when you can't help yourself.  It is counterproductive. She's not fucking the people who give her scholarships.  You've been kind of downvoted, but honestly, as the OP of this comment thread, you're totally onto something. I've written thank-you notes to the people who fund the scholarship which allows me to attend college, but when you're sleeping with the person who stocks your grocery shelves, it introduces a different dynamic which I'm not entirely sure how to handle. I feel comfortable thanking objective and wealthy third parties for their generous academic donations. I feel less comfortable handling a situation where the man I'm sleeping with buys my groceries, even though he barely makes enough to buy his own. It's an entirely different situation.  Exactly!  And I don't care if people downvote me, I totally get it and agree.  I hate being \"taken care of\" by men because it almost always comes with strings attached.  If he can't accept that it makes you feel icky then say it again She's not fucking the people who give her scholarships.  How is this relevant?  He is not actively doing anything to make her feel guilty.  If he was holding it over her head, I would better understand your point.  However, no one, including those providing for her scholarships,  is holding it over her head or expecting anything in return.  They are simply providing someone with assistance whom they have deemed to be in need.\n\n How is this relevant?  He is not actively doing anything to make her feel guilty.

It is counterproductive. I may have been misguided in using the term \"power differential\"; I really didn't expect to be taken to task for that, but perhaps I should have been more academically clear. *No one* in this relationship is being oppressed, and I am absolutely grateful for everything I have. I worked very hard to earn my scholarships, and I am deeply indebted to the people who have worked to make those opportunities possible for me, but, again, I am not in an intimate relationship with those people, which introduces an entirely different dynamic (although, as you pointed out, etiquette is very important here and I have absolutely done my best to express my gratitude toward everyone who has made my education possible). \n\nMy boyfriend and I have only been together for about six months, so--as I'm sure you understand--there is a degree of negotiation and personal capability involved as we sort out the practicalities of being together. Being in a relationship with a man who is 11 years older than me introduces certain (not insurmountable) challenges that might not be present in a relationship with a man my age. He knew me when I was in high school, so I feel an added pressure--not encouraged by him, but merely an entirely self-imposed and self-driven impulse--to appear mature, adult, and self-sufficient. Whether or not that is an appropriate impulse is up for debate, and is certainly not what I meant to argue when I initially posted. \n\nI understand that complete self-sufficiency is rare, and it may be an immature aspiration on my part. Please do understand, however, that regardless of the best intentions of either party, a relationship that nearly spans a generation does most certainly involve a difference of power, independence, and financial capacity. 99% of the time, we are like any other couple. However, there is the rare occasion that makes me realize that he is at a very different place in his life, and that is a strange thing to feel. It doesn't cause a rift in our relationship, and we've talked about it before; it's just something that we have to work around, considering our specific circumstance. I shouldn't feel guilt for my boyfriend buying me groceries on the sly because I can't afford them easily, and yet I do. Human condition. It's easy to say what we should or shouldn't feel, but how often do you adhere to your own pragmatic or academic ideals? \n\nThank you for the (truly welcome) probing questions. You're right, in some ways, and I'm not denying that. But you also aren't bringing up any questions I haven't considered before, so don't worry--we're figuring this out on our own. :)  You seem to have a very level head and to have put much thought into this.  I apologize for any assumptions or assertions that I made, and you are correct that adhering to your ideals and reality are often quite different.  I wish you two the best in the future, and by the sound of the communication that you two have in your relationship, you most likely will.  Best of luck! :)  We both have student loan debt. I am $80k in the hole. My significant other is maybe $15k, tops.\n\nI got my degree in anthropology. In one of my cultural anthropology classes, there were cultures that would give each other gifts as warfare--as eventually, someone would go bankrupt and be unable to give anything. Sometimes, this is what it feels like to me when he tries to give me something, though I know that's not the case.                 ",

    "snippet" : "Hi 2X,    \n\nI need to rant and I don't know where else to do it. Last night I was out at the bar with a girl friend from out of town. Long story short, I was drugged at some point that night and I don't even remember things from before arriving at the bar. From receipts I've pieced together that I only had two drinks. Apparently while out I was complaining about being dizzy and not being able to see properly. Once we got home I became violently ill and in a drugged haze ended up breaking my shower doors.    \n\nNow for the rant. My friend from out of town keeps quoting things I did and said last night and laughing about \"how hilarious\" I was when I was drugged. She has been recounting the night to all the friends we've met with today. Not only did she not notice that something was seriously wrong (being nearly incapacitated and all) but she is laughing about all the stuff I did when intoxicated. I'm already seriously embarrassed about my behavior and I don't need her shoving it back in my face again and again. Sure I didn't get raped or sexually assaulted, which I'm very thankful for, but I was still drugged against my will. Maybe I'm the minority but I don't think anyone being drugged without giving consent is funny. UGH, /rant.    \n\nTL;DR got drugged at a bar, accidentally destroyed some shit, \"friend\" laughing about how hilarious I was when I was drugged.  So what did she say when you explained about how you feel about her behavior? She told me to stop being so serious because nothing bad happened to me (like being assaulted).  She told me to stop being so serious because nothing bad happened to me (like being assaulted).  That is *not* an okay response. Physical harm has to befall you before she shows any concern for your well-being? I'm sorry, but she sounds like a shitty friend. She told me to stop being so serious because nothing bad happened to me (like being assaulted).   Well shit. I would be going up the walls if one of my friends got drugged; I would likely rage for hours on end, then swear to protect her forever, then go to the bar and ask questions. I would not be laughing at her. \n\nDump her. ASAP. I would not feel safe around someone like that. She clearly cares more about her own entertainment than your physical well being.  And that's why you are a good friend. I'm definitely leaning towards dumping her though. Well shit.

You should call the bar and let them know what happened to you.

If the person who did this frequents the bar, the bar could warn patrons and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. \n\nYou could help to prevent this from happening again to someone who doesn't have a friend with them.  Guy here. To me, the very idea of being drugged by anyone, without your knowledge and consent is appalling. The idea that someone that is supposed to be your friend is making light of it is disgusting. I agree. If two guys were at a bar and one of them was drugged, and the other made fun in the morning, he'd be looking at a punch in the face. I guess that isn't how women generally deal with unacceptable disrespect.  I'm very glad that you're okay. I know exactly how you feel! Since you have the positive test for a drug, have you considered filing a police report?\n\nA male friend of mine got drugged at a bar all my friends used to go to regularly. I wasn't there, but apparently he stumbled outside to go home and went missing for 5-6 hours. The next day he found his backpack in a ditch, his bike had been impounded by the police, and he had some very random stuff that wasn't his (a stuffed owl toy and a women's athletic jacket).\n\nEveryone thought it was hilarious. In fact, they joked so much that at first I didn't realize he had been drugged. I asked him how all of that stuff could have happened and he told me. It still upsets me that people think it's funny. I asked him if he was okay. He looked really surprised and said no one else had asked him that. *Really?*\n\nTo top it off, he can't really talk about it because he thinks his girlfriend will get mad at him for ending up with another woman's clothing.\n\nI don't even know how this shit can happen, but your friend is not alone in her behavior. It made me nervous to drink around that group of friends. I would have hoped that they'd look out if something happened to anyone. :(\n\n Wow, that's truly terrible for your friend. There is definitely a huge double standard when it comes to men being sexually assaulted. I can't believe his girlfriend would be angry with him for having a woman's jacket when it might have been his attacker's. That is really awful.  Does your friend seem like the kind of person who'd drug you? As a stupid, stupid joke? You should file a police report, putting drugs into people's drinks is a very serious crime. The police being involved will make your friend take this much more seriously, and if she didn't drug you she might have noticed someone else at the bar acting suspiciously.  I would really hope she is not that type. Who would even do that as a joke?! I'm probably going to file a report with the campus police. I'm not very hopeful they will find anything though.   My take: one of two things happened, each equally likely. 1. Your friend did it as some type of a lark, thus her very unlikely attitude or 2. Someone targeted you, doped your drink, then realized you were with a friend and didn't follow through. My bet is that your friend was involved. Her attitude is too bizarre and cavalier for something obviously serious. Find a new friend and find a new bar. Be more careful with your drinks. It is too easy to slip something into a drink. I'm not saying she did it but with an attitude like that, who needs her. You were drugged, for gods sake. It happened in that bar. If it wasn't your friend, drink elsewhere, at least for awhile. And I'm not saying you did anything wrong but if you need to drink out of a damn sippy cup to protect yourself, then do so. No woman can afford to not closely guard her drink in a bar. It's pretty scary not being able to leave your drink with someone you consider a good friend. I will keep the sippy cup in mind for future nights out ;)  Friend or not, I would make a police report. What she did to you was not appropriate at all. She wasn't the one to drug me, at least I don't think she did. It must have been someone random at the bar. Sorry if I didn't make that clear. Ahhh, sorry about that. Then you may want to take her to the side and tell her you don't appreciate how she's acting and that you wish for her to stop. It's a bit childish that she's acting this way especially when you're uncomfortable with it. Thanks :). I tried talking to her but she just dismissed it as not a big deal because I wasn't taken advantage of. She basically said I was having a great night so why should I be mad? Dizziness, vomiting, clumsiness isn't a great night to me. Welcome. &lt;3 She's being pretty insensitive of your feelings. I doubt she would think it was funny if it happened to her. I'm sorry it happened to you. *hugs*  ok i dont get how do u know it was drugs and not just from drinking :?\n\n\nps i wasnt judging i was just wondering! I went to the doctor this morning for the intense nausea. I mentioned I had been drinking the night before but that I don't remember anything so she decided to do a blood test just in case. It was positive for flunitrazepam, a date rape drug. Apparently in large quantities it will cause severe vomiting. ok that makes sense sorry it just didnt sound like drugs to me. did u tell the friend the dr said so :? Yes, she actually had to drive me as I was throwing up in a bucket in the front seat. My friend knows I was drugged but she doesn't think it's a big deal since I wasn't assaulted or taken advantage of. thats just sad. even if its just booze a friends sposed to feel concerned. then make fun when he or shes all better :p but being druged isnt funny i think u shld report it to the bar manager just so they know to look out. i work in a bar and we take this stuff very srsly That's what I thought too :(. I'll definitely report it to them if I'm up and around later today. Thanks for the advice! ok i dont get how do u know it was drugs and not just from drinking :?\n\n\nps i wasnt judging i was just wondering! Because she only had two drinks, from the receipts. Had it just been that OP decided to get pissed off her face and drink the place dry, she would have been sober when making that decision and would have remembered it. [deleted] ok i dont get how do u know it was drugs and not just from drinking :?\n\n\nps i wasnt judging i was just wondering!   Maybe it was your friend from out of town that drugged you. She apparently thinks the fact that you were drugged against your will completely hilarious, so I wouldn't be surprised if she was the one who had done it. \n\nEven if she didn't do it, I'd never speak to her again.\n\nReport this to the police and to the bar at which this happened.

    "snippet" : "Hey ladies,\n\nI feel a little embarrassed asking this question, but I was wondering if anybody could offer me some advice.\nBasically, I have been trying to ask my university for some important documents. I am basically in my home country and my university resides in another country so going there myself is not possibility.\n\nWell, last week when I sent emails requesting these documents I was kindly informed by the staff the it was something that the Master coordinator was in charge of and that they had redirected my request to her. After waiting a few days and hearing nothing from her. I sent her 2 emails within two different occasions asking her politely if she could help me and provide me with these important documents. Still nothing! At this point I am starting to get slightly irritated. I have tried calling her today, but she doesn't answer my calls. TYPICAL!\n\nDo you guys have any advice on what I can do? Should I continue calling? Call the office in charged of my specialization (don't know how useful this would be since they always redirect me to some other person)? Complain to the Dean?\n\nI asked advice from my boyfriend and he says that making a complaint to the Dean would be detrimental if I need future documents from them, but at this point I am starting to not care. I saw an official place from the university where you can make complaints, but I do not know how much of an effect it will have. This isn't the first time I have experienced problems with them and usually I have had to go there myself to organize my shit! Agh! I am just so frustrated...\n\nAny help or advice would be greatly valued!  You actually want the administrative person in the Master Coordinator's office.  You can probably find the name on the university web site.  \n\nBe VERY polite. Email.  Do not expect anyone to return an international phone call.

    "snippet" : "Hey TwoX.  You guys have really helped me out in the past, so I thought I should ask this here.  The background of this might get a little long.  Please bear with me.  \n\nI moved in with a friend I met at university in August 2012.  We both were starting grad school, both \"adults\" (I'm 27, she's 30).  And importantly, we both needed a place to live, ASAP.  I have nowhere else to go, and she was living at her parents' after a previous roommate kerfuffle.  The thing that I missed, I guess, is that she *could* live with her parents.  I can't.\n\nSo she's moving back to her parents' house to take care of her mom, which I totally respect.  Her mom has cancer, and her siblings are complete screw-ups, so there's no one but her, and she's stepping up to her family responsibilities.  *However*, she's also strongly implied that she's going to leave me high and dry with rent that I can't afford in the process.\n\nWe both signed the lease, but she's primary.  Her dad actually co-signed for her since both of us were subsisting on financial aid.  I have a decent job now, but the paycheck won't come in for a few months, and it still won't cover the full amount of rent here.  She's working full time for great wages now, and she's keeping her job, so she's not hurting for money at all.  But with regards to this whole switch-over, she's turned really manipulative, and like I said, implying that the remaining rent (until August) is my responsibility.  I only caught this because my bf said she was full of it when I told him the problem, so I checked in with the complex and then I started noticing a lot of double-speak on her part when we tried to get my friend to move it (she can't).\n\nI talked to the apartment complex about this, and they said because she signed the lease too, she's responsible for either paying the rent or finding someone to take over for her.  After progressively stronger implications that *I* am going to be the one screwed in this, I finally reminded her that an eviction will show on both our credit reports if she doesn't cover her part of the rent, not to mention her dad's credit.  I really don't think she cares.  Her ad says that she doesn't want to \"leave my roommate hanging.\"  \n\nSo fast-forward to this last week.  She's finally posted an ad on Craigslist and emailed (she's being passive aggressive at this point and not talking to me even though we live together still) to tell me she had 10 people reply.  Great.  I'm fine with the idea of finding someone to take over her part of the rent... but I'm not fine with someone I don't know/don't trust just moving in without first getting to know them.  The sticker for me is, I'm terrible at reading people.  I take things for face value and people at their word, and I've learned that this generally doesn't work, so at this point, I'm less inclined to trust people (especially after my current roommate went from seemingly logical, nice person to manipulative, bitch who I'm scared to come home to-for reasons unrelated to her having to move).  I am willing to try interviewing potential roommates, but I know me, I know how I come off (I'm abrupt and usually too direct when I try to be assertive at all, and this is my home, I don't want to be afraid to come home to it).  \n\nI'm just scared that none of these 10 people are going to work.  Either they're going to be people I don't think I can live with, or they're going to think I'm an idiot, insane, and a bitch.  This is apparently the impression I give to other people, and I have no idea why.  Someone here suggested I might be on the Asperger's spectrum, and after researching a lot, she's probably right, but I don't have insurance or the money to go to a psychologist.  I'm just doing what I can to recognize my problems and deal with them so I can live with other people.  Am I really missing something here?  Please tell me if I am!\n\n**So, in sum, my roommate is ready to stop paying her portion of the rent.  I'm willing to interview potential roommates, but I'm bad with new people and I'm really worried that none of them will work.**  If they don't work, I feel like my roommate is going to blame me and say screw it, it's *my* fault and *she* tried.  Side note: I've also been looking for another roommate, even though I really think it's her responsibility.  If she does that, and doesn't pay her half of the rent, it's only a matter of time until we get evicted (right?).\n\nI would be less worried about this if she didn't have a history of being downright childish when it comes to any problems with this place.  I admit that I might be being paranoid and reading things that aren't there because I'm not picking up on the things that are.  But *in the worst case scenario* - she bails, I can't find new roommate, we get evicted - is there anything I can do to protect myself?  I have good credit up until now, but my income is really small and I'm already worried about qualifying for an apartment on my own.  I can't afford an eviction on my record.  I want to say it's not fair, but I know the apartment company doesn't give a damn what's fair.  They just want the rent paid on time.  And is there a good way to approach someone about this who won't even talk to me (see email above), and when she does is passive aggressive and tries to manipulate me?\n\nBecause it's relevant to regional laws, I'm in Michigan, USA.  Sorry for the wall of text.\n\n**TL/DR** If my roommate leaves and I can't find a roommate to cover her part of the rent, is there anything I can do?\n\nEdit: Also, if you have any ideas on how I can talk to my roommate or how I can approach these interviews, that would be really helpful!\n\nEdit 2: Some emphasis to clarify some of my issue.\n\nEdit 3: I realize this has fallen and nobody is looking at this, but in case somebody is, I could really use some advice.  She came home and is being really nasty passive aggressive again.  I tried to just say hi and asked if she had a minute to clear some of the air, and she shut me down immediately.  I have no idea how to talk to her about finding a new roommate (or any of the stupid petty stuff that's going on like the silly game of \"whose dish is this\" with the washing).  Most important, I really want a say in who I'm going to be living with.  How do I do this when she won't even talk to me?  Just keep looking for roommates.  It doesn't really matter if it's \"fair\" or not that you have to do it - you have to do it.  It's a lot better than leaving it up to her to botch and then leaving you up shit creek.\n\nSo get those ads out and start interviewing roommates!  If you can know that you have someone lined up, you'll be a lot less worried.  \n\nAlso, as far as getting along with roommates goes, there are 3 golden rules:\n\n1. Don't share food.\n2. Have a chore schedule.\n3. Decide on when quiet time begins.\n\nEverything else, just don't worry about it.  Your life will be much simpler, believe me!   Good luck. That's what we do.  It works for the most part.  Ads have been out, and I'm sure the interviews will start soon.  I'm just really worried that future roommates will have trouble with those three basic rules.  This is honestly the first roommate I've had who can follow them. It's all about setting the terms in stone early in your living situation.\n\nAnd peeing on their bed if they break them.\n\nJK I have animals I can train to do that! J/k\n\nAre people usually okay with setting terms down like that? I personally love it when everything is out on the table. This would be my preferred approach... I'm just worried I'll scare away potential roommates by doing it off the bat like that. I would love a potential roommate who did that. It means you *also* plan on being a decent person. The girl moving in is likely just as scared as you are of picking someone terrible! I have animals I can train to do that! J/k\n\nAre people usually okay with setting terms down like that? I personally love it when everything is out on the table. This would be my preferred approach... I'm just worried I'll scare away potential roommates by doing it off the bat like that. I always discuss those things right when I move in with people.  I try to get the \"rules\" sorted from the \"preferences\" early on, and never break the rules.\n\nI think bringing the topic up in a proactive way sets a good example for the rest of your communications as roommates.  It shows that you want to be open and direct, and at the end of the day you just want to solve the problem at hand. I always discuss those things right when I move in with people.

Is it safe to assume people are going to be honest in return if I'm upfront like this? My instinct is no, but is there a way to tell if they're going to be a nightmare to live with? Warning signs or red flags or something I can look out for when I'm talking to them? Honestly?  Not really.  But if you help set good pAtterns then the likelihood of truly terrible situation s (like being afraid of her) are lower!\n\nA good question to ask is why she left her other living situation , sometimes that can give you a warning of what her issues are.  Interview roommates and pick who seems the best one. You can't drag your feet about it either - even though your former roommate is on the hook for paying the rent, if she can prove that you deliberately put off on getting someone to replace her, then you'll be held financially responsible. \n\nYou can't really fault her for leaving if she has to help with a sick family member.  I don't fault her for leaving at all.  I have no intention of deliberately putting off getting a roommate.  I've been trying to find one for a while now.  I'm worried about the \"what if they're all bad?\" problem because her ad gives options that I wouldn't be okay with.  Like I'm allergic to smoke, I don't want to live with a smoker - I'll be sick all the time.  She said smokers okay, and she won't talk to me about this now, so I can't even communicate logistically *how* I can interview the potential roommates.  Under her circumstances, she's actually being pretty reasonable.  Generous, even.  She didn't create this situation, but she's given you notice and she's trying to find a replacement.  She's found TEN possibilities.  If you reject ALL TEN, what exactly is she supposed to do?  Find a hundred?  \n\nIt sucks for you. But she's facing up to taking care of her mom, possibly losing her, and you're freaking out because you have to...deal with a new roommate?  You kind of don't look so good here.  On a moral scale, you're embarrassing yourself.  \n\nFind a new roommate.  It's the very least you can do for her.   Under her circumstances, she's actually being pretty reasonable.  Generous, even.

You kind of don't look so good here.  On a moral scale, you're embarrassing yourself.  \n\nFind a new roommate.  It's the very least you can do for her.   I'm fine dealing with a new roommate and I've been looking for a new roommate for months, she just started this weekend.  She can well afford to keep paying her part of the rent until one is found that matches.  What concerns me is that after this month, she seems to have no intention of paying, whatsoever.\n\nI guess from where I'm sitting, it is her responsibility to either pay her half or find someone compatible to pay it for her.  If she picks (extreme example here) ten women who are okay with having a new guy over every night that they barely know, I have an issue with this.  I've had this happen before with roommates, and I'm not okay living like that again.\n\nI should also point out I live in a pretty bad area.  I want to feel safe in my home.  So I guess that makes me a horrible human being. &gt;I guess from where I'm sitting, it is her responsibility to either pay her half or find someone compatible to pay it for her. If she picks (extreme example here) ten women who are okay with having a new guy over every night that they barely know, I have an issue with this. I've had this happen before with roommates, and I'm not okay living like that again.\n\nCompatible is not in the contract, she just has to find someone who can pay and is willing to take over the lease. I hate to say it but that's the risk you take when you move into a place you couldn't afford on your own. My number #1 advice to people is ALWAYS make sure you could afford the place you are moving into by yourself, because you never know when/if roomates will screw you over. &gt;I guess from where I'm sitting, it is her responsibility to either pay her half or find someone compatible to pay it for her.

My number #1 advice to people is ALWAYS make sure you could afford the place you are moving into by yourself, because you never know when/if roomates will screw you over. So she can pick just anyone, and I have no say over it?  Is that seriously how it goes?  (From a legal standpoint.  I'm honestly asking because I don't know.)  Because I still have to sign the new lease with whoever she picks.  Our apartment doesn't allow subletting. You can sign or you can refuse to sign and find somewhere else, those are pretty much your choices. If she is truly your friend she will try to find someone you'll get along with, but it sounds like she has bigger fish to fry right now, so I would try to be proactive and be a part of the interviews she is doing so you'll have input.  The manager of the complex said that she can't withdraw from the lease unless a new lease is made, and I can't qualify on my own for a new lease.  This was the point at which my roommate told me I would just have to be homeless unless *I* found a new roommate.  When I told her about the conversation with the manager she started looking as well.\n\nI feel so bad for what she's going through.  A lot of my friends have had to deal with parents who had cancer.  At the same time, she's known since November that this was a possibility and she's done nothing but try to get out of her end of the lease by getting me to agree to letting her off until this week (and she's moving out next week) so that's part of my concern.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on *how* to interview new roommates?  I'm worried that I'll be offputting to a potential roommate if I'm honest about me/my lifestyle.  Not that I'm a noisy slob or something, actually the complete opposite.  But I live in a college town and a lot of apartments are party dens. I would ask people what their schedules are like, what their activities are like, do they have problems with no drinking/drugs rule in the house(if you are against that). Sounds like you are looking for someone quiet and non-disruptive, and it's perfectly ok to state that up-front to them. So she can pick just anyone, and I have no say over it?  Is that seriously how it goes?  (From a legal standpoint.  I'm honestly asking because I don't know.)  Because I still have to sign the new lease with whoever she picks.  Our apartment doesn't allow subletting. I would look for a Renter's Rights association in your city that can give you clarification (for free) on the laws. Everywhere I have lived, the only way a sub-leaser is approved is if BOTH current tenants and landlord approve the sub-lease.   &gt;If they don't work, I feel like my roommate is going to blame me and say screw it, it's *my* fault and *she* tried.\n\n\nBingo. It is YOUR fault, and SHE did try. She's doing her part to get out of her lease. Your other option is to sublet the whole apartment (with your LL's permission - some will even let you sign the lease over if the new tenant passes the credit check) and get a smaller place for just you.\n\n As a person who has been on both sides of the situation (I've left leases, my roommates have left leases), OP is not being unreasonable. Just because the roommate found some Craigslist randos does not mean that she put appropriate effort into the search and doesn't deserve blame for the crappy situation.  While I wouldn't want to live with a random stranger either, given the situation at hand I think it's less than reasonable. Her only other real option is to pay the rent and cut back bills in other places, then take her current roommate to small claims court for a reimbursement for her half of the rent. It just seems like these 10 prospective new roommates are being written off as \"sketchy Craigslist weirdos\" before she even gives them a shot. ",

A Guittar is not hard to learn (really, there are just some basics, you can cover any song with it).\nIf you really want to star a cover band, do it ;) i wonder how long it would take to acquire the necessary skills  Everyone has hobbies, go for it.

Bass is quite simple to learn but in order to get much creativity out of it you have to get to intermediate level really.  Singing is great fun, I'd very much recommend that.  Or playing synths or keys - they're easier in terms of being quite mathematical.  Sounds awesome.  What sort of covers? I\"m not sure yet.  Any ideas?  ",

I wore a different dress and it was low key and fun. All my family understood that we wanted a smaller wedding. It saved money and it was all my husband wanted.

My fiancé and I are of the same mindset as you guys where we just don't believe in the whole giant wedding thing. Instead we're doing a small garden party-esc thing in my parents backyard for our family and really close friends, 20 people in total. We're getting a marriage commissioner to come by the house so we can sign the certificate in front of everyone and then just have a really nice get together. I LOVE that idea! We really do want our loved ones around but it doesn't seem fair to do a destination wedding because of the cost for each of them to get there. This is a great solution to that problem!

We had what many would call a small wedding, what ALL would call an informal wedding. I freaked out. I didn't have fun. I still stress out thinking about it. The marriage is FANTASTIC, but three years later I still don't much like to think about the wedding.\n\nWe made other people our first concern. I wish we had eloped, I would have a wedding I could look back without panic.  Let them host you a party afterward. If its possible you guys should look into doing a getaway vow renewal, just the two of you in a location you have always wanted to visit. Weddings are SO stressful and so public. They are less for you than they are yourselves. A getaway vow renewal with a small vacation afterwards would be something private, personal, and filled with love and relaxation. I like the idea of just escaping to somewhere beautiful, buying a white dress there and finding someone to perform a short ceremony before you guys do whatever the fuck you want to do. :)   I had my wedding in my grandmother's back yard on June 30th. It was a beautiful, sunny day. I screen printed our invitations, and asked the the guests wear purple and bring a dish &amp; drinks to share, so it was like a purple potluck wedding. My grandma has a small pool in her back yard as well, so guests were able to go swimming. :)\n\nThe whole thing cost maybe $500, including my dress, the invites, my bouquet, and the ring I bought for hubby. My husband splurged a little bit on his suit, but I think his suit was less than $300. Everything else was free/provided. Didn't have to pay for the venue, my mum wanted to pay for the cupcakes we served (which had little medallions on them with David Bowie's face), my grandma wanted to pay for the rentals of dishes, tables &amp; chairs, the guests brought the most amazing food &amp; drinks... It was honestly the best day of my life so far.\n\nIt was all really informal. We'd actually gotten legally married a few months before, so we just kinda said our \"vows\" to each other and there were a few speeches made by our closest family members. Everyone had such a good time, including me! In fact, a few hours before the wedding, I realized that I didn't have a bouquet and thought I might look awkward in photos without one. So we rushed around to find somewhere that was open on a Saturday morning, bought a beautiful bouquet for about $50, and headed to my grandma's place. It wasn't until after everyone had left and we were cleaning up that I realized... holy shit! I completely forgot about the bouquet that I'd rushed out to get earlier that day! It was sitting in a vase on the dining room table the whole time. I was honestly having such a good time that I forgot about it!\n\nIt was still a little stressful planning everything, even though there really wasn't that much to plan. But the end result was wonderful. I like the potluck idea! That would solve the problem of getting 20 toasters if we just asked for a dish instead of a gift.

Otherwise some people see asking for a specific gift (even a practical one) as rude.\n\nI personally would be totally up for a potluck, but I know I have some great aunties who might not have been so amused had I made that choice.\n\n(Also, give some careful but real consideration to food poisoning liability.)

Should have posted under my other account, but I guess it's too late now :( Sorry to let you down! I can assure you that it was lovely though! :D  Maybe have the actual wedding ceremony consist of just you two, the registrar and a witness, then celebrate later. The bit that fills me with dread is having to say some soppy words in front of everyone, no thanks. Me too. While I understand why some couples do it, I would never be able to read my vows out loud. They're personal and meant for each other. And I might be exaggerating, but it seems to cheapen the vows when shared with everyone and not just the person they are meant for. Just my two cents though.  Me too. While I understand why some couples do it, I would never be able to read my vows out loud. They're personal and meant for each other. And I might be exaggerating, but it seems to cheapen the vows when shared with everyone and not just the person they are meant for. Just my two cents though.  I understand your feelings, but I'd just like to offer a different perspective.\n\nIt's a lot harder to make a commitment to someone in public than it is in private and to tell everyone, not just your special someone, how much that person means to you.  But in some ways, that's the point of a wedding - if you're ready to make that kind of public commitment in front of everyone despite the discomfort, then you love each other enough and are committed to each other enough to get married.\n\nThis is not to say that I think vows made in private don't mean as much or that couples who make such vows aren't ready to get married - I only want to give a different way of thinking about vows where sharing your vows with everyone actually adds value to them, rather than cheapening them.    Ehhh. I understand that viewpoint, but it just seems so invasive to have to \"prove\"your love publicly for the sake of others. The process of a very public wedding is a historical practice because weddings effected public images and social classes in society. But were in a time and society where love in the most important aspect of the wedding and how people handle that display should happen as they choose.  Ehhh.

But were in a time and society where love in the most important aspect of the wedding and how people handle that display should happen as they choose.  Nothing personal, but I've been on a campaign against this particular error lately. You're looking for \"affected,\" not \"effected.\" :)  You know what would be awesome?  A surprise wedding.\n\nInvite the people you want to a party.  Like, a cookout, or a holiday party, or whatever.  Then, have whatever clergy fits your style walk in, tell the guests to gather around, and have the quickest vows ever.\n\nMinimal preparation, the party is already in full swing, and it will be talked about forever. YES! The only problem I see is that his family lives out of state... :(   My parents gave me $5,000 and said we could keep whatever was leftover after paying for the wedding. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.\n\nWe had our favorite cheap local indian restaurant do half the food, and my mom cooked a couple lasagnes for the other half. Cake came from our favorite local bakery. My dad brewed a keg of beer. I hired a local seamstress to sew a dress I sketched out on paper... $750ish? That was the biggest expense, I think. Hair students did my hair for $40, bought flowers at the farmer's market that morning for $40. We rented tables and chairs, the cheapest ones they offered, and a small tent in case it rained. Our musician friends provided ceremony music. The non-denominational officiant was something like $300. \n\nWe waited until sunset and [stood in my parent's field](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/4664_699455453528_2251822_n.jpg).\n\nThe in-laws paid for a nice rehearsal dinner for about 15 of the guests, close family and the like. We just had dinner at our favorite french restaurant. Two nights at a nearby historic bed and breakfast were a makeshift honeymoon. \n\nWe ended up with $1500+ leftover. I think there were... 40 people there?\n\nOh, and we didn't register for gifts, people just gave us cash. We did some [traveling](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/163652_896164846328_3955044_n.jpg) with the money later. You guys look so cute! This is the kind of wedding I want. Outside, low-key, cute dress, nothing over the top or terribly fancy.  You might consider a weekend getaway wedding. My best friend did something similar in the Smoky Mountains last December:\n\n1. Rent a big cabin, chalet, or beach house. She rented a huge 10 bedroom chalet for 4 nights for about $1500 (cheaper than hotel rooms for everyone)\n2. In lieu of gifts, she asked everyone to bring a) Their favorite board or card game, b) their favorite movie, and c) Their favorite alcohol\n3. They got to the chalet on Wednesday and spent the day buying groceries for the weekend, decorating the living room (where the ceremony took place), and setting up sweet care packages in each of the bedrooms for us guests.\n4. We all got there on Thursday with our games and liquor and pies. They invited their immediate family and best friends only, and made a point to plan different group activities throughout the weekend so the families and friends didn't fall into their respective social circles. (Nothing cheesy. No wedding shower fun facts. Thursday night was a big dinner and group discussion. Friday night was board games in the afternoon and a movie night after dinner, etc.)\n5. Saturday, we all pitched in to set up. We bought flowers, got our hair done, picked up extra wine, etc. She had arranged for a couple dozen cupcakes from a local bakery, as well as local wedding officiant and photographer for a few hours in late afternoon, so the wedding was right at sunset, in front of the big fireplace, surrounded by candlelight and flowers.\n6. The reception dinner was a big holiday-style dinner cooked by the moms: Turkey, stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, etc. Instead of cake and Jordan almonds, we had cupcakes and a hot chocolate bar.\n7. Sunday morning was a big breakfast, and we all helped them pack up. It was simple, but so much fun, and so full of love and laughter. Of course you need to tailor it to your family, finances, and interests, but it's a good way to avoid the stress of wedding showers and bridal spotlights, while still making your inner circle feel like they're a part of your day. That sounds so beautiful. Thanks for giving me a plausible wedding idea. Happy to help. :) Keep us posted on your decision! I'm in a similar boat (or will be, if we ever get around to getting married), and would love to see what you put together.  My wedding was about $2,500 total. A lot of friends and family donated time and services as their wedding gift.\n\n**The Dress**\n\n* **Sew your own**: My mom started to make my dress, but got pretty sick and couldn't finish it. :-( Still, fabric/ pattern/ lace was less expensive than a new dress.\n* **Borrow a dress or reuse a family member's dress, like your mom or mil's.** It's a gesture that is both thoughtful and frugal.\n* **Rent your dress from a prom store**\n* **Buy your dress second-hand** Lots of thrift shops, second-hand dress stores, etc. \n\n**Tux or Suit**\n\n* **Tuxedo/ Suit rental** Compare and contrast rental prices. If you prefer location A for selection, but location B for price, take the offer from location B to location A. Location A will usually match it.\n* **Purchase** Investing in a nice suit can be useful for many occasions in the future. If you watch the sales and buy the suit from a place like Mens Wearhouse, it can be tailored, pressed, and taken in for low-to-no cost in the future. It's a good investment.\n\n**Bridesmaids dresses**\n\n* **Sew them**. This is what I did. They turned out well and were affordable.\n* **Pick a color and let the bridesmaids choose a dress in whatever style they prefer in said color.** This is what I wish I'd done, because my bridesmaids never wore their dresses again. This way, they might have re-used them.\n* **Pick a style and buy a rainbow of colors in said style.** This one just seems fun.\n* **Let your bridesmaids wear a nice dress that they already own.**\n\n**Photographs/ Music**\n\n* **You get what you pay for.** \nIf someone donates their services as a photographer or dj as a wedding gift, or if you hire a photographer for $50 off Craiglist, *do not be surprised* if the photographs and music aren't super-professional-awesome. Just be grateful you have pictures of the wedding and music without breaking the bank. If super-professional quality is hugely important to you, then make sacrifices to pay for services from a professional. Don't cut corners. If you're fine with inexpensive photography and music, though, then this is a key area to save money in. \n**Location**\n\n* **Church Building** Depending on the religion, type of building, and your personal relationship with the religion in question, church buildings can be a cost-effective and affordable way to do it. Plus, some church buildings already have tables and stuff that you can use for the reception.\n* **Parks** If you're having a summer or spring wedding, or you live in a reasonably dry locale, look at what the different parks in the area offer for wedding ceremonies.\n* **Grange halls** These are usually in smaller towns or more in the country-ish. Around here, most of the grange halls I've seen look kind of like giant barns on the outside, but have decorative windows and really nice paneling on the inside. They work well as a location for a small wedding and reception, and they're usually affordable to rent for a few hours. \n** At home** If either your parents, your in-laws, or another friend have a lovely home and/ or backyard, see if they would be willing to host the wedding. This requires a good relationship with the person and high sensitivity to showing respect for their home, but if it goes off well it's a great solution. Also it's a fantastic excuse for keeping the guest list really small.\n\n**Food**\n\n* **Costco** You can get all those sandwich/ cheese/ fruit platters at Costco, as well as some inexpensive wine or champagne (or Martinellis cider), and set up a sort of buffet spread for the reception. \n* **Friend/ family who cater?** I know, I rely on this one a lot. But seriously, any time someone talented enough to do a job offers to do it for your wedding, *accept and make it clear that their services more than suffice as a gift.* This is a great way for both parties to save money -- your friend/ family member doesn't have to buy a spendy gift, and you get to save money on your wedding prep.\n* **Cake** A woman who decorated cakes professionally in our ward did mine. It looked fucking awesome. That said, I was planning on just getting an ice cream cake from Baskin Robbins or a generic bakery cake from Costco until she offered her services as a wedding gift. It's cake. It gets eaten. This is one of those things where it's really up to the preference of the wedding couple. If you're okay dropping a couple hundred on a perfection confection that will ultimately be eaten, then just figure out where else to cut costs so you can swing it.\n\n**Invitations**\n\n* **Digital** I understand this is gaining in popularity. I think it depends on the wedding and the formality/ informality of it.\n* **Personalized** Doing something quirky and unique to you guys as a couple, like picking out fun postcards and printing up the wedding information on the back, or making the cards by hand (this option is best if you invite fewer than 50 ppl).\n* **Formal** There's usually a local print shop in most towns and cities. They'll have a whole range of styles and cost options that you can browse in-shop, and if you find a style in the more expensive range that doesn't fit your budget, they can usually work with you to find or create a less expensive knock-off with the same vibe.\n\n**Flowers/ decor**\nI've got no real ideas here, to be honest. When my husband and I got married, he was working a plant nursery and they gave him a *massive* discount on some bulk flowers. We made the arrangements ourselves, and since none of us are professional florists/ flower arrangers, they were pretty basic -- hanging baskets here and there in the reception hall, flowers in vases on the table, that sort of thing. My husband put together the corsages.\n To piggyback on my previous comment:\n \nExamples:\n\n* **My wedding** \n\nMy wedding was around 10 a.m., in a different room that was set up pretty basically. Some rows of chairs, an \"aisle\" (no chairs set up), and a movable podium. I waited outside, and when the wedding started they opened the door and I walked down the (very short) aisle and married my husband. It took less than 15 minutes. \n\nThe reception was in the afternoon. We bought round fishbowls, those cheap shiny glass gems, and tea lights at the dollar store. The church had round tables and tableclothes. We put white tableclothes on the round tables and spaced them around the room. The centerpiece on the tables was the fishbowls, filled with the glass gems and a tea light. On the left side of the room was a long rectangular table for the gifts and sign-in sheet. On the right side of the room was a long rectangular table with the buffet spread and wedding cake on it. The receiving line was in the middelish/ front of the room. \n\n* **My sister's wedding** \n\nShe rented an arch (like the white kind in a garden) and twined fake vines/ grapes through the lattice. This was set up in the middle of the room. A red carpet led through the middle of the room up to the arch. Sparkling lights (christmas or fairy lights, depending on your location) were strung across the ceiling. The room lights were set to low/ very dim. Round tables with white tablecloths were spaced around the room. The centerpieces were fake grapes and vines on a sort of mini-roman pedestal. The two long tables holding gifts and buffet food were at the back of the room. \n\nBoth the wedding and reception took place in the same room, one after the other. \n\n* **SIL #1 wedding** \n\nIt was at the home of her close friend. The friend had a sweeping circular staircase, and the bride wanted the dramatic moment of her bridal train trailing down the stairs. The groom wore his Army dress uniform. The ceremony took about 10 minutes and then we milled around in the kitchen and ate the provided food for a bit before the bride and groom decided it was time to go and kicked us all out so they could start their honeymoon.\n\n* **SIL #2** \n\nShe doesn't have many friends, so it was mainly just their families. The groom did put some of his friends on the guest list. She did it at a grange hall, and didn't really decorate. My husband did the catering, flowers, and photography for her. When the ceremony was over, all the guests sat around and watched her open the gifts, and then we all went home.\n\n**Conclusion to Post**\n\nI think my sister's wedding was the most expensive wedding I've been to. Mine cost ~$2,500. \n\nAn inexpensive, affordable, low-stress wedding is totally doable, it just means letting go of all the Cinderella idealized expectations and recognizing the wedding day for what it really is: Not the \"perfect day\", but a party celebrating the formalization of your relationship and moving into the next stage of your lives together. \n\nIt's really not the party that matters; it's the relationship/ marriage itself. You can have an awesome wedding and an awesome relationship, or a shitty wedding and an awesome relationship, or an awesome wedding and a shitty relationship. One does not predict the other. It really is just a celebration -- there's no need to stress over it or conform to other people's expectations of what a wedding should be.\n\n*edit/* When I say \"awesome\" vs. \"shitty\", I'm not talking about the expense invested. I'm talking about how the couple in question ends up feeling about how the party turned out for the time and cost invested. \n\nI bet you can have an amazing, lavish, epic princess wedding with ice sculptures and expensive doves released and a bajillion dollar dress, and it would be an awesome party that everyone loves and totally worth it. I have no judgement on people who prioritize that type of ceremony and pull it off without debt. (that's the key part: starting a marriage with massive debt is a horrible idea).\n\nAt the same time, a casual, low-key affair in someone's backyard with paper lanterns strung on the trees and everyone in their nicest clothes is also an awesome party, and sounds equally fun and awesome. One wedding is not inherently better or worse than the other based on expense alone; the key thing here is celebrating the marriage itself and doing it in a manner that does not put future financial strain on the newlyweds or their families. My wedding was about $2,500 total. A lot of friends and family donated time and services as their wedding gift.\n\n**The Dress**\n\n* **Sew your own**: My mom started to make my dress, but got pretty sick and couldn't finish it. :-( Still, fabric/ pattern/ lace was less expensive than a new dress.\n* **Borrow a dress or reuse a family member's dress, like your mom or mil's.** It's a gesture that is both thoughtful and frugal.\n* **Rent your dress from a prom store**\n* **Buy your dress second-hand** Lots of thrift shops, second-hand dress stores, etc. \n\n**Tux or Suit**\n\n* **Tuxedo/ Suit rental** Compare and contrast rental prices.

We were outside under a tent, the food was buffet style and people were relaxed. My husband and I choose a venue based on their ability to take care of my different aspects. They had tables, dishes, linens, we got married and had the reception there. The venue did the food. Easy, fun.\n\nAlso, you don't have to have showers if you don't want them (and you don't plan those anyway). You don't have to send out ultra fancy invites if you don't want them.\n\nFeel free to do it your way! You and your love are the ones who need to be happy at the end of the day.     I also wanted a small wedding because I hate huge parties and spending too much on one day seemed silly to me. A friend let us use her house, we had 30 guests, a friend married us and afterward we had a BBQ. My one advise is: hire a good photographer! It's so worth it. Luckily I have a plethora of close friends that are spectacular photographers so I won't have to worry too much about that!                                 ",

    "title" : "Finally feeling normal after almost of birth control woes!",
    "snippet" : "Hi TwoX,\n\nSo last October I decided to change from the pill (Microlight) and get a slightly more permanent form of birth control. I went into the family planning clinic looking for long term birth control. I had spoken to both my mum and my aunt about it and had decided that I was interested in getting the Mirena Coil. I wasn't set on it though and had spoken to another friend of mine who had the implant and it worked wonderfully for her. \n\nI went into the clinic with a consultation appointment. I discussed what birth control I was on, how I was put onto the pill at 14 due to incredibly painful, heavy, 3 week long periods, my history of anaemia due to these horrific periods and what had worked for other members of my family. The doctor instantly dismissed the Mirena Coil saying that I was too young for it (I'm 23 but I was just 22 at the time) and said I should get the implant. I was a bit nervous about it because one of the possible side effect was large amounts of spotting but I trusted the doctor and the following week I got the implant.\n\nEverything was fine and dandy for about 6 months. I got normalish periods (one's that were heavy and lasted about a week and a half but nothing crazy) and although I felt kinda tired and sometimes grumpy I didn't get any mood swings.\n\nThen after about 8 months everything went haywire. I started getting constant periods. I would spot constantly all month. Sometimes the spotting was so heavy that it went into full period territory. I was exhausted all of the time and would have some pretty extreme moodswings. My libido completely vanished and having sex was painful and would cause even heavier bleeding after. I was really stupid (and broke) and didn't go to the doctor until this stuff had been going on for 8 months.\n\nI went to the doctor and I had to get a smear test, a full STD and STI test and a blood test. Everything came back negative. She also discovered the reason why sex could be painful a lot of the time. My cervix was completely open all of the time. I was then referred to a gyno because my doctor feared that I might have a cyst in my womb. \n\nLast month I finally got to go to the gyno and had a full vaginal ultrasound. She first of all said that she would have never in a million years given me implanon considering my history of incredibly heavy periods and that the implanon wasn't working at all. She said that despite how young I am she would have recommended the Mirena Coil, especially since it had worked well for both my mother and my aunt. Apparently I had been really lucky that I didn't get pregnant while I was on it and it was most likely the heavy bleeding the hormones were causing that prevented me from an unexpected pregnancy. However there was no cyst or anything strange other then what was the side effects of the implanon. So she booked me in to get it removed.\n\nThe following week I went in to get it removed. The poor doctor spent 45 minutes trying to fish the damn thing out of my arm and I had to get stitched up afterwards because of how far into my skin it had gone in. The doctor said that this was the worst one she had ever had to remove. When I went to get the stitch removed I got my blood pressure taken and it's currently too high to put me back on the pill. I have to go to my regular doctor at the end of this week to get it taken again and if it's not low enough I'm going to have to get a monitor that will monitor my blood pressure for 24 hours to see if it's high due to stress (work is really stressful right now and I get really stressed out and nervous going to the doctors). Obviously this isn't ideal as I want to be back on the pill and I was really worried about heavy uncontrollable periods again. \n\nHowever since the implant was removed a week and a half ago I had a period, which lasted a week and was normal/slightly heavy but nothing unusual and then it stopped on Saturday and I haven't bleed since! My mood is evening out and I'm feeling much more energetic. After this ordeal I'm starting to feel normal again and it's the best feeling in the world! I'm hoping on Friday I'll go to the doctor, my blood pressure will be normal and I'll be put back on the pill.\n\nEventually I think I would like to go on the Mirena Coil but for now I've learned that you should trust your gut. I didn't think the implant was ideal for me and I should have gone to another doctor for a second opinion. Even if I can't go back on the pill until my blood pressure is fixed (I'm assuming this has to be stress. I'm 5'5 and 136lbs. I cycle to work every day and I do exercise three times a week as well. I eat mostly healthy and there is no history of heart disease in either side of my family.) I'm just starting to enjoy feeling normal again for the first time in a long time.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks for reading my rant if you read till the end.\n\nTL;DR: After 8 months of constant bleeding and moodswings I finally got my implant removed and finally feel normal again for the first time in a long time.\n\nEdit: TYPO IN THE TITLE! =( It's supposed to be \"I finally feel normal after months of birth control woes\"",

You must be excited about this new guy and you should be! But dont let it overwhelm you. Play it cool. Talk to him from time to time but dont swamp him with msgs. Its a bit hard but let things develop naturally and try not to force anything. This will give you time to get to know him and for him to get to know you, building a deeper bond between the two of you\n\n2) Improve yourself. Just because you are 46 does not mean no one will ever want you again. That is determined by how you maintain yourself and carry yourself. Be confident. If you know you are overweight, hit the gym, work out. Go to /r/Fitness for help and look at /r/progresspics or /r/motivation to keep yourself motivated. This will give you more confidence and keep your new guy interested (and may even give you attention from others!)\n\nI wish you the best :) Sorry, but part of this is terrible advice. Her new guy is already interested. If she wants to lose weight then of course she should, but advising someone to lose weight so they get attention from the opposite sex is kinda shitty, in my opinion. ",

    "title" : "9 Sexist Things That Happened At The Oscars",
    "snippet" : "  This entire list can be condensed down to one point.\n\nOne sexist thing happened at the Oscars. Seth McFarlane This entire list can be condensed down to one point.\n\nOne sexist thing happened at the Oscars. Seth McFarlane  During his “We Saw Your Boobs” song Seth MacFarlane listed off women who’s breasts he’d seen in their movies. As if this isn’t grotesque enough four of the instances he listed were scenes of rape or the character was raped during the movie.\n\n    Hilary Swank in Boys Don’t Cry.\n    Jodie Foster in The Accused.\n    Jessica Chastain in Lawless.\n    Charlize Theron in Monster. During his “We Saw Your Boobs” song Seth MacFarlane listed off women who’s breasts he’d seen in their movies. As if this isn’t grotesque enough four of the instances he listed were scenes of rape or the character was raped during the movie.\n\n    Hilary Swank in Boys Don’t Cry.\n    Jodie Foster in The Accused.\n    Jessica Chastain in Lawless.\n    Charlize Theron in Monster. He's being satirical. About himself as a man being immature and acting like a stupid person. He's mocking the male gaze (especially because those movies are usually dramas). I do agree that the Scarlett one was taking it too far. I can see why it reads as offensive to impressionable youngsters who don't get it and take it on face level and I can see how it can be not funny to people, but I really do not believe that this is sexist.  I'm not an \"impressionable youngster\" you patronizing ass. He's not being satirical. He hates women. Everything he does is incredibly sexist. He constantly jokes about abusing women. \n\nAnd yes, I've watched multiple seasons of multiple shows written by him. I don't have cable anymore, so I don't watch them now, and going back I can't see why I found much of any of it funny. I'm so deathly tired of his version of \"humor\". I actually didn't mean to call you or anyone offended by this an impressionable youngster. That's my bad - I worded it wrong. I meant it's offensive because impressionable youngsters can take it as men should treat women this way, that it is funny that women should be treated this way, when he is saying that we should mock men who treat women this way. I'm sorry if that came off the wrong way.\n\nThe way I interpret his TV shows is absurd humor. That abusing woman is usually done by stupid characters that are overly ridiculous and overly full of themselves. They are usually painted as idiot characters, or it's so ridiculous that these women would be treated like that because they are usually hot bombshells. Again, I can see why younger people can take this the wrong way and get influenced by it, hence why people get offended. And I can also get why people think the humor is not funny or tasteless.\n\nI'm sorry you got such a condescending tone from me when that was not at all what I meant. I appreciate the apology.\n\nI just don't agree that it is absurd humor. I honestly think that he just finds abusing women as funny. I don't think he's trying to \"mock\" the men who treat women like this because those men are always the main character of the show and the main character always seems to get exactly what he wants. \n\nThey might be idiots, but they always win, and no one on the show calls them on their horrible mistreatment of women. It just doesn't seem like satire to me - maybe if Meg were constantly humiliating and beating up Peter - that might be satire. Instead it just feels like laughing at a guy abusing his daughter.   What? This is ridiculous. The boob song was silly, he was poking fun at himself. It was a witty banter between him and William shatner. Shatner was telling him about the future and how he ruined the oscars. \n\nI found the only awful jokes to be the segment with Ted.\n\nThis is an overly sensitive list. The oscars was pretty classic Hollywood. The jokes were light hearted, no political agendas, and enjoyable dancing and singing scenes.  Things can easily be sexist and still have no conscious political agendas.  Well to be fair he said the thing about Salma Hayek and Javier Bardem, and the joke about Jennifer Aniston being a stripper was supposed to call attention to the fact that Channing Tatum had actually been a stripper.  Well to be fair he said the thing about Salma Hayek and Javier Bardem, and the joke about Jennifer Aniston being a stripper was supposed to call attention to the fact that Channing Tatum had actually been a stripper.  It's not \"fair.\" \n\nHe mentioned Javier Bardem, but he wrote the joke specifically about Salma Hayek. That a man was mentioned in the joke doesn't make it not sexist toward the woman it was targeted at. \n\nDitto Jennifer Anniston. The point of the joke was \"Hahaha I bet she was a **stripper**! SLUTS! Amirite fellas? LOL!!\"  I thought the joke was: you think it's a woman, but guess what?\n\nKinda highlighted by Channing Tatum's further discussion on waxing. No. He said \"Of our next two presenters, at least one is honest about being a former exotic dancer.\"\n\nThe joke is not only that Jennifer Anniston was a stripper, it's also that she's lying about it. That's not funny unless you think that there's something shameful about sex work and that women shouldn't lie about having been strippers because the general public has the right to slut shame them.  He has a point, a part of the joke was playing it on your expectation, letting you come to opposite conclusion by thinking about it.   \nThe other part was just a kinda variation on the clasical gag *What's the difference between x and y...  ...Something absurd* \n\nSometimes jokes are just about patterns rather than some complex play at social complexities of being a female sex worker. Just because something is absurd doesn't mean it can't also be sexist. Context matters.  Exactly context matters, you have to account into play why was it absurd. He basically implied that Americas sweetheart, Jennifer Aniston, that has a goody image was an exotic dancer just like that guy. That was funny because the situation is absurd, it's not about the social perception and slut shaming of the business in question as it's about the absurdity of it being truth.  \nIt wouldn't be nearly as funny (or even work) if he had done it with Lindsay Lohan instead.\n\n\nThis kind of jokes work regardless of gender so I can't see why some people are calling it sexist (maybe it's just a watered down definition of sexism )\n\nOf course every time you have to explain a joke to someone you essentially kill the joke.\n &gt;it's not about the social perception and slut shaming of the business in question as it's about the absurdity of it being truth.\n\nI disagree. If there was nothing shameful about being a stripper, there would be no absurdity and thus, no joke. \n   wow. I hadn't watched it. How'd they get away with it?    I didn't watch it, but I kind of feel like its being a bit overly sensitive to call it sexist. I mean, the host was Seth McFarlane, who is very well known for his off-color humor and the Oscars are meant to have tons of pop culture and poke fun at its guests.     ",

Do you think that cheating only happens in relationships that are not perfect? That the cheater is seeking something that isn't available in his relationship? I'm curious about the possibility of truly loving two persons at the same time. I'm curious about your opinion on the subject.  Not the OP, but how can one \"truly love\" two people at the same time and yet go behind at least one person's back to cheat? That's not love.\n\nIn response to the original question, I could only forgive cheating if it was a one-time mistake and my partner was forthcoming and very remorseful. Any long-term cheating or even an ongoing emotional affair without the physical aspect would devastate me. Do you think that cheating only happens in relationships that are not perfect? That the cheater is seeking something that isn't available in his relationship? I'm curious about the possibility of truly loving two persons at the same time. I'm curious about your opinion on the subject.  If you're capable of loving two people (and some people undoubtedly are) then monogamy probably isn't for you. In which case, what was wrong was trying to force monogamy when one person isn't monogamous. Polygamy != cheating. Some people need different boundaries set and it's only going outside of those boundaries which is cheating.  &gt; In which case, what was wrong was trying to force monogamy when one person isn't monogamous.\n\nThis was ultimately the case with my spouse and I.  We didn't expect to fall in love, and I tried rather hard not to mess up her existing [monogamous] relationship.  She loved us both, and ultimately transgressed the boundaries of her other relationship (cheating) because of it.\n\nWe are both rather unusual, and even though I was 24 at the time, she was the first - and only - person I had ever loved.  We understood each other on a level neither of us had ever experienced, and an internet-only relationship couldn't stand up to a flesh-and-blood person in the room next door.  I wish things hadn't gone the way they did, but we learned from them, and structured our relationship with that understanding in mind.\n\nI don't worry about her cheating (nor does she worry about my doing so).  We have set boundaries consistent with who we are, and we neither demand, nor desire monogamy.  Breaking the few rules we do have (honesty, openness, safety) would gain nothing, and risk everything. I think a lot of people get caught up in what *they* define as cheating, it doesn't occur to them that cheating is going outside the agreed boundaries of the relationship - and that not all relationships have the same boundaries.  People also have this weird idea that open or poly relationships mean it's a free for all.   With us, it's certainly not a \"free for all\".  Our boundaries serve to protect against STDs, abuse (by others), and things that would harm our relationship (we avoid dating people who provide the same things we get from each other).\n\nWhile many people seem to enter open relationships out of a \"we're staying together [for the kids/for appearances/because divorce is bad], but we don't need to live our lives lonely\" kind of mentality, ours is more a recognition that asking us to love one and only one person would lead to heartache, and missing out on a chance to make life even better. I don't think any successful poly relationship has ever been a free for all.  People don't seem to understand the levels of trust and security that a poly couple need to have in each other, far more than in a closed relationship.  It's great that you've found someone who has the same ideals as you, I assume it's much harder to do that in a non-traditional set up.

In which case, what was wrong was trying to force monogamy when one person isn't monogamous. Polygamy != cheating. Some people need different boundaries set and it's only going outside of those boundaries which is cheating.  I totally agree. If polygamy is accepted by the spouses, then there is no cheating unless they cross their own boundaries. I believe that cheating would decrease if people would communicate more. Some people are just not meant for monogamy. They should be honest with themselves and their partner. I'm one of those that believe it's possible to love more than one person at a time. I'm not currently in any relationship and never did apply the polygamy rule to my life. Maybe it's something to consider. I have never cheated on any of my previous partners. I was woman enough to say when things weren't working out. I don't have children or any responsibility that makes this kind of decision harder.

I disagree because there is no such thing as a perfect relationship.  I know of one that survived cheating and they are in their 70s now (cheating happened in their 20s). The wife still doesn't trust the husband. In all other cases, cheating lead to the demise of the relationship. Of cheaters I know, only one has cheated once and learned from it. The others just keep doing it.  I also want to point out that if they're in their 70s, then the cheating would have happened in a time when divorce was still almost unheard of, and that today they probably would have gotten divorced at some point, especially if she still can't trust him after 50 years.

The others just keep doing it. \n\nYah, I really want to believe cheaters can make a mistake and learn from it but in all honesty, I've never seen it happen in real life.   I'm sure some could forgive and forget, but I never would be able to.\nI couldn't stay with someone who had made a decision that they knew would hurt me. Maybe they'd cheat again, maybe not... but I would always look back to them causing me pain.  I know it is possible to forgive/be forgiven for cheating. I cheated on my (now) husband after our first year of dating and we've been happily together for almost 20 years now, 12+ of those married.   I did whatever it took to rebuild and regain his trust without issue and he's an amazing person. We worked it out and we have very strong trust and open communication because of what we went through. I'm not saying cheating typically works out this way, but I personally know it can.     None of us can speak for every couple - some people are willing to put up with all *sorts* of shit. \n\nBut, speaking for myself, cheating is one of the three unforgivable sins in relationships (the other two are physical/emotional abuse and substance abuse). No ifs, ands, or buts; no second chances. Obviously I'm not saying that this is universal, but that's where I personally draw the line. \n\nLoyalty is *extremely* important to me; on the whole I can forgive a hell of a lot, but breaking trust to that extent is a point of no return.         It's probably in no way the answer you're looking for, but go to /r/polyamory . You might find a few stories there of monogamous relationships that were nearly destroyed by cheating, but with strong communication and some major changes were able to become healthy open relationships. Even there, it's not super common. It can be done, and it is done, but cheating is hard to recover from in any relationship model.  I am pretty sure that most open or poly relationships start from relationships that either begin already open or start monogamous and then the open part is deciding consensually. Ethical non-monogamy really emphasizes communication and looks at cheating as a despicable thing.  It isn't the sex or love outside the relationship that is so bad, it is the lying and deception that is so hurtful.\n\nI am non-monogamous, I love watching my partner have sex with other women and we love enjoying group sex together.  What makes it comfortable for us is that it is done openly with consent and trust and communication.  I'm happy to let him fuck another girl if he talks about it with me first and we agree together that we both want it.  However, if he lied to me and broke the mutually agreed upon rules of our relationship (which are free to be renegotiated at any point if we mutually decide) then I don't think I could ever forgive him.  The lies and deception are just the ultimate form of disrespect.   Well, I'm going to be the odd one out - Yes, I have been cheated on, forgiven my partner and worked through it and come out okay. I know exactly what you're talking about though. Every time I've spoken about my experience in the past there's been an immediate backlash, and even open-minded redditors who view everything else in the world in shades of gray shut down into a black-and-white mode of \"Nope, cheaters are forever cheaters and anyone who forgives them is weak and naive and doomed to a terrible trust-less relationship.\" It's ridiculous... and quite insulting, frankly. \n\nI realise that many people who say these things are trying to help, but I am quite happy with my decision and don't need to be condescended to as if I don't know my own mind. I don't regret my decision in the slightest. These people were not present, and they do not know either me or my boyfriend, and I think these things absolutely depend on context. You cannot paint every person with the same brush. I made a decision to stay when it happened, and it was a decision that I made with strength. I felt utterly capable of leaving him in the moment and was even close to doing so. I realised that in some ways it would be the easiest solution and that if I stayed I would be in for some tough times. I decided that I was prepared for the consequences, and that my boyfriend was someone who I could offer another chance to.\n\nAt first it was hard. It took months and months to really regain trust...  and in that time he was nothing but amazing. He didn't shy away from any blame, and did everything he could to comfort me and get my trust back, and now a year later and we're going strong. We've both become better people by being together, and I'm not afraid of him doing it again. It's not a decision that every person would make, or even *should* make... but it was the right one for me. I hope that as women who are generally supportive of others' decisions, those here can respect that, even if the rest of reddit can't. It's weird how freaked out people can be by the concept of cheating. People seem to liken it to murder.              I was taught, and still believe, that cheating is equivalent to abuse. You wouldn't stay in an abusive relationship, so you don't stay with a cheater. Easy peasy. Except some people do stay with abusive partners. Actually, it happens frequently.  I think I'm an odd example, but I've been cheated on and honestly didn't care.  I think I'm an odd example, but I've been cheated on and honestly didn't care.               ",

    "snippet" : "Heyyyyyy sooooo... so my boyfriend turned 20 a couple of months ago, which marks about 4-5 years of him suffering from extreme acne over his face, chest, and back. He's tried everything under the sun, spare acutane, to try and curtail the extent of the damage, but nothing seems to help. His family has a history of extreme acne, and he has felt so much pressure from his parents to \"fix\" his skin that the topic is something of an emotional landmine now. At this point, he has pretty much given up entirely on finding help. He won't even visit a dermatologist (he thinks that he can only go to a GP with his insurance but I know for a fact he can go to a specialist).\n\nI'd be fine to leave it well enough alone except ... I know his skin bothers him greatly. He regularly mentions how gross he feels. If his skin has broken open, I politely let him know there's a spot of blood, and his eyes just get ... *sad* as he takes care of it. He comments on my skin (which really isn't the best) longingly. \n\nI don't want to become like his parents to him about this ... but I want to stop him from suffering because of it. I want to be able to help him either feel more confident or help him take action. I don't want to keep ignoring how this effects his self-esteem. \n\nTwo X, how do I help?  Is there a reason he hasn't tried accutane? \nI know it's a bit controversial, but for me it was the ONLY thing that worked, after years and years of trying every product on the market. When I think of all the money I could have saved, all the scars I could have avoided (emotional and physical), I'm angry at myself that I didn't use accutane sooner.    Accutane *is* a harsh drug, but I've taken it for 5 years (unrelated condition) and I can offer my thoughts on it. For acne it's prescribed for either a single 6 month or 2 6 month periods, and with a sufficiently supportive doctor there should be no problems.\n\nSide effects:\n- Dry skin - drink lots of water and use a good moisturiser, especially on and around the lips. \n- Depression and risk of suicide (which is often considered the most serious) - it's scary to think of but the doctor should be monitoring this very carefully at monthly visits. The slightest hint of depressive and/or suicidal thoughts (even reported by family) should result in treatment being stopped.\n- GI tract problems - again, drink water and watch the diet. Monthly blood tests should check that the body is absorbing nutrients correctly. \n\nThe thing is that 6 months of a few bad side effects could save him 10 years of future misery. After 5 years on the stuff I'm ready to stop before I'm wrecked, but I was fine after just 2. \n\nAs for the emotional stuff perhaps you need to focus more on him as a boyfriend, not as a girl friend that you might help out more. He can spot for himself if his skin has broken and having you point it out probably isn't making him feel particularly good. Make it clear to him that you see past his skin by not commenting on it.

Try to spend time at a friend's house or doing extracurricular activities. Try to spend time outside. Do whatever you need to to physically get away from this situation. \n\nI promise, this won't last forever, but it *can* be very traumatizing in ways you may not even realize until you leave home.  I'm seventeen. And as I'm typing this, they're shouting again. And reading what you said brought tears to my eyes.\n Oh, honey--I cannot express how much I feel for you right now. I feel like I was JUST 17 and trying to shut out the noise with a pillow over my head. \n\nI wish I had an easy answer. I wish I could give you a way to fix it. It is HARD to constantly live in a combat zone, and don't ever let anyone minimize how heartbreaking it is. \n\nMy first week of college, I wrote this in my journal--I don't know if this helps right now, but please look forward to the day when fear is NOT the norm, when you become accustomed to coming home to a quiet dorm or apartment and you are surrounded by people who care about whether or not they hurt you: \n\n&gt;It’s laundry day, and I don’t have any clean clothes and I don’t have anywhere to be. I’m sitting cross-legged in the laundromat in the basement of my apartment building, wearing a gray tank top and my blue striped pajama pants. My glasses, heavy square black frames, make me look beautiful. They make me look beautiful because I think they do, and because no one can tell me they don’t. Since I left home, no one has tried.\n  &gt;It’s 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon,, and I don’t know if it’s sunny or storming, but the brick wall behind me feels cool and solid and good, and when I go upstairs with my arms full of warm laundry, everything will be safe and solid and good, and I don’t have to be anything anymore except who I am. \n\n&gt;This is my life now: I walk across the campus in the rain. I unlock the door to my apartment with a key that is only my own. I make tea in my electric kettle, I dance in the kitchen in my socks. I let my wet hair stream down my back and I don’t mind. I put on my vinyls and I sing with the Beatles while I drum on the counters with my hands. I am brilliantly happy. This is what is it to be happy. \n\n&gt;It’s not that I wasn’t happy at home. Sometimes I was, but it was cautious and blunted. It was full of apology. It carried with it the burden of uncertainty, like this: “I’m happy? Am I happy, am I happy, happy right now, am I, can I be, almost almost happy, so close to being happy, not yet, not yet, not now. Not quite. I am happy if you are happy. If you are angry, I am afraid. If there is fear I am afraid. If there is fear I am fear. I am fear. There is fear and I am”. Now my happiness is this: “Yes.” \n\n&gt;There’s still a certain degree of sadness that I like to hold on to, because I think it’s important to not lose that. It’s like holding on to a mooring when your sails are full of wind. You have to hold on. I have to hold on, anyway. I don’t know who I would be if I were completely unmoored. But my sails are full and the rope is creaking, creaking, and at least I’m not sinking anymore. But when I’m dancing in the kitchen in my socks, when it’s windy and storming outside, when I’ve carried the rain inside and my hair is dripping and tea kettle is whistling and I can see, from my bedroom window, a nest of sparrows taking shelter in the eaves—on days like this, it’s hard not to come untied and to sail sail sail out, laughing the whole way to the horizon. You're a very good writer. It's nice to see someone else has had the problems that I'm having. And it's comforting to know that there's a way out.. Eventually\n It won't last forever. I just feel for you so much, because I've totally been there. Give it a couple of years--better days are coming.  And I feel bad for my boyfriend cause I know he wants to get me out of here, but he can't. At least not yet   Hey, lady.  Like u/Underwoodfive, I grew up in a situation a LOT like yours.  I moved out as soon as I possibly could, and while it took a while, about 10 years later, I am really, really 100% okay.  \n\nI almost hesitate to put that I'm over a decade out, because I remember me at 17, and being in that situation, and feeling like there was no way I would make it to 21, much less 30, but here I am, and you know, I really am okay, and I really have been very nearly okay for years and years now, and now I really am okay.  And I do think that you should know that.  The situation that you're in sucks.  I know that it sucks.  I know that to the point of knowing what you mean when you say that you want to cry or tear your hair out.  \n\nAnd I want you to know that it does get better.  It might take some time, but it can get better.  \n\nIt might help you to talk to an adult, if there is someone around you feel safe talking to, like a school counselor or a pastor or something.  You deserve to have help in getting through this.  You are worth that.\n\nAlso, getting out, going to college, or, if college, or getting a job and getting more independent, or both, will probably help some, if only by getting you living in a different place.  And having a goal in mind, be it college or a job, can help give you something to focus on and work towards, and having something to look forward to is important when you're living in a situation like you're in.\n\n&lt;3  I try to focus on my breathing when I get them. There is a technique I learned from yoga where when you inhale, you breathe in through your nose and restrict the air flow so it makes a hissing noise at the back of your throat. You breathe in slowly making that noise, then you hold the breath as long as feels comfortable, and then slowly let it out. It's called Bellows Breath.     I think that is an anxiety attack not a panic attack. I used to get panic attacks all the time(only I didn't know what they were at the time. I'd just be sitting in class, or at the store, and all of a sudden some sensation of my body, like light headedness, triggers a panic response because I thought I was about to pass out or something, then adrenalin kicks in and makes you feel even weirder and you panic more, etc. \n\nAnxiety attacks trigger from anxiety, and if you seek help, online or professionally, I think you should call it that to hopefully get the information you need.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and I think you're headed in the right direction. Seeking help (even just advice from caring strangers on the internet) is a great start to recovery. Just knowing your not alone can help greatly with anxiety issues, and give you the confidence to move further in taking care of yourself.   [deleted] I try to spend a lot of time with my boyfriend, but he just got a new job and different hours so I rarely get to see him. Plus I've got a stupid curfew\n sorry thats not super helpfull :/ i guess i just want to say its not forever. they can only do this for so long til u move out. and its gonna take time to get over this. just spend the time working to the goal. read listings for roomies and start looking for a job asap even a part time can mean having the money to get into a place",

    "snippet" : "Title says it all. I was blessed with having two competing job offers and I chose the one that I thought would be more challenging and exciting. Well, I was right about it being difficult, but in every other way I was misled about what to expect and I've been miserable (and not working up to my potential) ever since I started. My other job offer is no longer on the table (I asked) and now I'm trying to conduct a stealth job search while working 50-60 hour weeks (not including the 3 hours a day I commute to work generally 6 days a week) and simultaneously looking for a new apartment since my lease is almost up. I'm exhausted and disheartened and I can't help but feel like a big fucking idiot for choosing the wrong job. Any advice to stop feeling so down on myself about this whole situation? And any advice on how to get out of it?  How could you have known it wasn't what you wanted if they were misleading you? No clue. Maybe a crystal ball? So stop blaming yourself for making the choice you did. Thanks, I wish it were that simple. Maybe it is and I just don't see it that way at the moment.  This kind of situation may be a blessing in disguise. You tried something new, didn't like the path it led you down and here we are. Your lease is almost up, which means freedom to move anywhere a job may permit; despite having ties in your current city, you could always move somewhere new! Other than that, I guess you should be thankful for the fact that you actually have a job (despite your current hatred toward it) and some form of income while you're in this situation. Best of luck, though. ",

    "title" : "Looking for some non sex, sex suggestions? ",
    "snippet" : "So I stopped taking my birth control pill about a week ago because of some new symptoms I had been having after taking the same pill for about 8 years. My boyfriend was very supportive of the whole thing and never made me feel like I had to keep taking it, it was totally my decision. The thing is that he is totally opposed to having PIV sex when I am not on the pill. We have talked about it a lot and since he really does not trust condoms after a pretty serious mishap with a previous gf, I understand where he is coming from and we both don't want any kids for a couple years so this is really the only way to guarantee that. \n\nThe thing that worries me is that we have been having sex for 3 years now and we have never really done a lot of sexual things besides sex. We have done all the standard oral, fingering and a little bit of anal (but it's not really something either of us is super into). None of that stuff has ever been the main event though, which is why I am asking for suggestions on everything except for PIV sex. He loves blowjobs and I like giving them so it's not really him I'm worried about but I am thinking more about my own satisfaction (which is why I am asking all of you wonderful ladies). So give me all your best ideas I am interested to try anything!     Do you plan on going on hormonal birth control again soon or is this a long-term solution? I'm thinking about 3-6 months. I have another appointment with my gyno in three months to talk about it again.   Have you tried toys? \n\nFrom my own experience there's nothing quite like PIV so you may find your relationship changes. I'm curious as to what mishap gave him such a fear of just using condoms - I used them for a few years with no problems - is he afraid you're going to turkey-baste yourself preggers?! Your only other option is to try a non-hormonal contraceptive device. We haven't tried toys and it seems like there are so many options I don't really know where to start. \n\nHim and his ex had a condom break while they were in college and she ended up getting pregnant. They were both freshman so neither of them was ready for a baby and she got an abortion. The whole experience was pretty traumatic for him since he went to catholic school his whole life and never thought it would be him in that situation. While he is much more open to the pro choice movement now that he has experienced it he still just does not want to go through it again.  Surely the morning after pill (which does cause cause abortion but prevents pregnancy in the first place) would be ok should the condom break? I don't know, it could be a pretty big hormonal hit for you though.",
