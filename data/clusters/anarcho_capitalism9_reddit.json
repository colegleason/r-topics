    "title" : "Why not just make teachers millionaires?",
    "snippet" : "  Several teachers at my high school made six figures, all the administrators too, yet if I remember right the overall test scores were below what they were 'supposed' to be. Of course, the teachers making $100,000+ were because of seniority/automatic pay raises through the union and not actual market determination of your worth, so this isn't a particularly even comparison.  Same here. I think we all know Chicago teachers are well compensated and due to union agreements you can't fire bad ones and mediocre ones can make 6 figures easily with nothing more than time in. T/a's OTH are paid a 1/3 of that. I actually didn't go to high school in Chicago, I was out in Aurora/Naperville at the time. But it seems to largely be a statewide problem of overpaying because of the unions here.  Yeah, our looming pension crisis is heartwarming. Btw, are you still going to law school? Yep, over half done, on the internship hunt now.   The catch:\n\n&gt;But for TEP founder Zeke Vanderhoek, there’s no time to wait. Teachers must bring their A-game on day one, or else.\n\n&gt;“**We give our master teachers *one year* to prove themselves**,” Vanderhoek says. \n\n&gt;Teachers are judged on classroom management and student test scores. They're also evaluated by other teachers. Vanderhoek says **about a quarter of them don't make it to the second year.**\n\nThe other catch:\n\n&gt;In Kristen VanOllefen’s music class, there are also lessons in vocabulary and math. And Van Ollefen's job doesn't stop at the classroom. Last year, she also administered state achievement tests. This year, she has a different additional job. And that’s part of the secret to TEP's high pay: **Most teachers are doing the work of, well, two teachers.**\n\n**Edit:** In other words, this school is paying more money, but they're not buying the sames goods/services.  With that caveat it makes sense that the pay scale is different. I don't know if it's really a catch. Perform or be fired. It's the same way in any other highly paid, competitive field (e.g. business consulting). As for the \"two jobs\" thing, I'm not biting. From observing teachers and administrators back when I was in high school, I think it's reasonable to double-up.  ",

Your embarrassment is not even in the same ballpark =P Actually, I find that to be a far less embarrassing transition.  Ha, well that's encouraging. How so? Ha, well that's encouraging. How so? The only real difference between ancom and ancap is the underlying view on property rights. It's still a big difference, obviously, but I think it's ideologically much closer than statism. Man, I used to be a Marxist and AnComm. Your embarrassment is not even in the same ballpark =P If you don't mind being asked (for probably the umpteenth time), what was the idea or argument that most affected your thinking? Like, moved me from AnComm to AnCap? It seems silly, but I just realised that actual voluntary Communism would be indistinguishable from a private property system where everybody simply chose to share the results of their labour. And that if you were disallowed the choice of not sharing your labour, you were effectively a slave.\n\nIt's hard to say what exactly brought me the necessary ideas to understand that. I hadn't read any AnCap literature, or been exposed to much propertarian thought at all. It is still kinda a mystery really. Max Stirner definitely played a part in my dismissal of Communism though, through his writings and ideas I formulated my own incomplete conception of Subjective Value Theory and in doing so rejected Labour Theories of Value, which had never managed to convince me anyway. LTV makes sense once you realize it's not a descriptive but prescriptive theory of value. It describes how *they* wish the world to behave. \n\nLeftism runs on envy -- they can't stand the idea that someone else might be better than them and get paid more.

Your embarrassment is not even in the same ballpark =P How could someone be a Marxist and an AnComm ? How Marxist were you ? No like, sequentially, not simultaneously. Why did you stop being a Marxist ? Because I believed it inevitable that a State will breed a parasitic ruling class. This wouldn't refute all Marxism. Marxism is a lot more than a political theory. What do you think about materialism ? How do you see history ? Heh, which one (which historical materialism)?  Amen to this. I have a lot of friends who are Ron Paul libertarians too since  I honed a lot of my beliefs there and eventually found this subreddit which completely changed me. They constantly quote the Constitution and I have started challenging them to come to the core basis of what some of the Constitution represents. Also, that any group that feels they need to document your rights will just as easily erase or alter that document as they see fit. If a right is inherent then you don't actually need to document it. Just recently I challenged a semi-libertarian *\"is slavery wrong because of the constitution, or because it's immoral or harmful.\"*  I was sad to hear him say *\"the constitution\"* but evidently (heard though someone else) I challenged him to think more on that subject. Wasn't slavery supported by the Constitution, until it was amended in the 1860s? Amen to this.

Also, that any group that feels they need to document your rights will just as easily erase or alter that document as they see fit. If a right is inherent then you don't actually need to document it. Of course it needs to be documented.  It's not exclusive either.  Just because a right isn't listed doesn't mean that you don't have it.  If rights weren't documented then everything would be an argument.  The constitution is the basis of law in the US, to be built on.  \n\nYour argument that 'if they write it, they can take it (erase/alter)' doesn't hold up.  Just because the rights are enumerated doesn't mean that they can take it or erase it.  It's still an inherent right, like you said.  I agree with you, it IS self-evident.  \n\nI forgot, I'm in the anarchy sub.  Let me guess, you don't like signing leases for rentals either. Amen to this.

I only support 'going back to the constitution' because that would be better then what we have now. I believe that you will never see a real revolution that ends up with positive improvement over what we have now. All improvements are going to be incremental. \n\nOne thing to point out to the pro-constitution folks is how did many signers of the constitution justify the alien and sedation of acts in 1798. These acts made it illegal to criticize the then-current political party (Federalists) that was in charge of Congress and the Presidency. (It was still legal to criticize the Vice President since he was from a different political party). They used these laws to imprison many news paper editors and deport people.  They considered this perfectly and 100% legal under the constitution... people had the freedom to say what they wanted, but that doesn't mean that you can't later on put them in jail for it.\n\nEven Thomas Jefferson thought the case for the first amendment against the alien and sedation acts was a weak one and thought that the the amendment with the best chance of defeating the acts was the 10th... which basically meant that the states should simply refuse to carry out the orders of the Federal government. \n\n\nThe successful 1775 war of cessation from the British Empire was a huge step forward in liberty and freedom for this country. The constitution, not so much. :/\n\nBut, regardless, I support using whatever possible to limit and reduce the size of government.. including constitution. Once we get 'back' to limited government then it will be much easier to argue that it should be limited further... or even eliminated. The problem is that political systems don't go backwards - they ratchet up or fall apart. That's mostly correct, but I will take what I can get.     &gt;implying that you can get it  Lysander Spooner had it right.  \n\nThe Declaration of Independence is the more important document from the standpoint of personal liberty.  It's very clear in what they were expecting and the violations the colonial government was visiting on them, and it applies just as much to us today as it did to them.  Larken Rose is the shit. His videos drive right at the heart of the psychological delusion of the state. Larken Rose is the shit. His videos drive right at the heart of the psychological delusion of the state.

Do you have a bitcoin address? You can buy him a beer on me. You were probably kidding, but here it is.\n\n19B3qgDYj7q1mC62L4ANcRqG65Ax5zsMdG\n\nI'm brand new to bitcoin. Reading some of your posts on it over the months is one of the reasons I made the plunge. Well, at least it is what made me take a closer look. I still think Nielso and some of the Austrians have a good point and it might be a pseudo-ponzi scheme. Not a conscious one perhaps, but it could end the same way.\n\nEither way, the potential to really punish the state is there. At the moment, the barriers seem a little high for it to take off. From what I can gather, and I am by no means an expert on it at all, there is only one easy way for me to add funds that don't link directly back to my bank account. I have to email a guy up the street and give him cash. There is only one guy in my area, at least on the websites I looked at so far, who is willing to do those kinds of trades. I doubt I could sell my friends on this type of transaction let alone a large percent of the populace.\n\nGot any good bitcoin resources on how to add funds anonymously?

Which Larken Rose video do you refer to?  [After watching this, I agree.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrC5lRY4Kr8)  It's so frustrating when statist libertarians constantly refer back to the constitution to try to justify what the government is doing. I always hear \"If we just go back to the constitution then all these problems will be fixed.\" The problem is that the constitution is where we started and it led us directly into this hole. Either the constitution allowed such a government we have today to exist, or it was powerless to stop it. \n\nNext time someone brings out the constitution to justify 'smaller government' ask them why they think government would stay small this time. It was pretty small back when they started it and it just steadily grew in scope and power up until today.\n\nAlso when they bring up states rights as a subset of the constitution as a panacea. Like there's any meaningful difference between the federal government and a state government.  Are you referring to the power to tax and borrow money on the credit of the US Government? Hypothetically, if Britain tried to invade the US again wouldn't these powers be necessary for the new government? Yes we won the revolutionary war but you cannot always rely on citizen militias.

    "snippet" : "If a hypothetical anarchist society were to spring up tomorrow, what would happen to the many functions of government existing in the physical form that do not require abolishment, i.e. publicly-owned railroads, bureaucratic offices, publicly owned sewage systems etc. Stuff that due to its origin in the theft and oppression of peaceful people should not be left to for the states directors or managers to retain control over. Forgive me my cynicism but I trust neither the formerly governmental owners of the organization nor any single private interest to auction it off in a manner that would be fair in accordance with anarcho-capitalist theory.\n\nIn fact, this is merely a minor quandary of a far larger problem. The immediate aftermath of any transition to a voluntaryist society would leave huge imbalances of power due to the wealth accumulated  illegitimately by agents of the state. Do we \"confiscate\" and \"redistribute\" this wealth in the way of the communist or left anarchist? Or do we let it fade over time, trusting in market forces and the aversion of people to the idea of trading with their former oppressors (for comparison see the way in which many are loath to trade with criminals today) to bankrupt those that thrived off of institutional violence? A similar problem arises when we look at companies such as GM, who have survived only by the grace of the state in funneling them stolen money: do we dismantle these in a similar manner to how we would dismantle the Post Office or any other arm of the state? How much state assistance becomes a qualifier for illegitimacy in a business or institution?     Any kind of institutional change creats disorder in the long run. Even relativly slow gradual change does that.\n\nIf we would jump from what we have now to AnCap world, it would be the biggest institutional change since feudalism.

I watch a lot of flight of the conchords, and thought I could tell the difference between accents. Guess not!  Easy: because there are enough jobs worth the minimum wage to employ that many people. This is true, my first job during college in AUS was paying $18 an hour which is comfortably above minimum wage. Even fast food jobs often pay above minimum.  They have a very good economy going to base it on, all the mining they are doing is a great help. If they removed the minimum wage, I don't think you'd see much of a change in wage rates. The market has already determined where wages should be, the minimum wage simply reflects that. They also aren't spending ~5% of their GDP on defense, etc. 5%? I think your numbers are off, if you were refering to America. 5%? I think your numbers are off, if you were refering to America. You're probably thinking of government spending. No defense is roughly 25% of our federal government budget. Here is a good graphic representation / breakdown. http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/fed_spending_2013USrn  1. Their minimum wage [scales with age](http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx). Generally, minimum wage laws hit youths the hardest, but Australia alleviates that by reducing the minimum wage for younger people.\n\n2. Australia has a high Purchasing Power Parity ratio. PPP is a way to attempt to normalize the fact that the cost of living can vary place to place. Australia's ratio is [166](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CPL). This means $166AUD will only get you as far as $100USD. Thus wages should be adjusted down by a factor of 1.66 to get figures that make sense in the US. The top wage would have the purchasing power of $9.39USD, and the lowest mininum wage $3.54USD. \n\n3.

    "snippet" : "What would happen if someone was forced to commit a crime? For instance, someone's family is held hostage, and this someone has to rob someone else in order to save his family. The robbing part is clearly against the NAP, as an innocent person (the robbed) is aggressed against.\n\nBasically, he has to choose between letting his family die or robbing the person.\n\nIs the person who committed the  crime against his will still guilty?  The initial criminal is responsible and must be held accountable for those additional crimes.  What if the hostage was merely the man's favorite recliner, and the crime he is \"forced\" to commit murder? Is the initial criminal still solely responsible? Or is the man? Or is there some kind of shared responsibility? The initial criminal is responsible and must be held accountable for those additional crimes.    &gt; Is the person who committed the crime against his will still guilty?\n\nNo. Why? Quite clearly he has broken against the NAP.\n\nWhat if he does a crime that would be worse than the killing of his family, say the killing of 30 innocents? He would choose this over killing his own family because of emotional attachment. &gt; Why? Quite clearly he has broken against the NAP.\n\nNo, he was forced to by someone else, thus absolving him of any wrongdoing. The extent to his involvement may have to be determined in court, especially his actions at the time and if he acted appropriately. For example, he may still be found to be responsible for not contacting a security firm, or something similar. \n\n&gt; What if he does a crime that would be worse than the killing of his family, say the killing of 30 innocents? He would choose this over killing his own family because of emotional attachment.\n\nLet's stick with the original scenario. These discussions tend to get quite out of hand when people just keep changing the scenario.\n\nIn the original scenario, there are two likely outcomes:\n\n* the guy commits the cool crime of robbery, and his family is returned to him safely. Then the guy calls his security firm, tells them what happened, what the suspect looks like, etc., and he's arrested. I'd imagine the stolen property would then be turned back over to its rightful owner.\n\n* The guy doesn't rob the bank, the robber kills the guys family (and maybe him too) and then the robber get's apprehended, and likely sentenced to live in a jail. \n\nSeemingly, the criminal would be better off just doing the crime himself, thus taking out any confounding variables that could screw up his plan. Rather than involving another man and his entire family, he has a much better chance of just doing it himself. This is why you rarely hear about criminals forcing other people to commit crimes; it just doesn't work. &gt; No, he was forced to by someone else, thus absolving him of any wrongdoing.\n\nBut I've never seen a description of the NAP that contains the exception \"unless you're committing aggression to avoid some personal disutility.\"  This reminds me of the [Trolley Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).

I see something wrong with joining a military you know is in the business of empire, which creates the very enemies which justifies its existence, and then winding up in a position where you're shooting at a woman with a grenade, who would not have thought to lob such a thing at Americans were it not for endless occupation of their lands.\n\nI get your point -- a woman with a grenade is not a \"sacred cow.\"  Within the logic of war what you say makes sense and I am in agreement.  At the same time, I find it hard to consider these ideas in a clean room, given the fact of our all-volunteer military, which is, in terms of empire and adventurism abroad, the equivalent of flour in a cake.\n\nWhen a person joins the military, they make empire possible.  They know they are joining in service of the state, and that by joining, they will strengthen the ability of the state of make illegitimate war abroad.  \n\nTherefore, I hold them responsible.  The concept of a paid military gig which has little to do with defending a nation's borders, along with all of its benefits as \"service\" is absurd.

It seems out of character for Dr. Paul to say something like that about a fellow veteran and Texan, though I can't say for sure if he's done so in the past. On the other hand he's a straight talker and now that he's out of office maybe he feels he has more leeway to speak his mind.  I get the impression he was talking about the shooter, not the victim. I think he was saying that the guy deserves capital punishment. I was a little taken aback by that tweet when I read it earlier.

I'd be more irritated with Ron Paul right now if his tweet weren't so cryptic.  What does he mean by \"he who lives by the sword dies by the sword?\"  Is he suggesting there was some other foul play involved or is he just being a dumbass? It's a quote attributed to Jesus in the Bible telling his disciples to be nonviolent. In the garden of Gethsemane Judas comes to betray Jesus with a host of Roman soldiers. Peter draws his sword and starts swinging, but Jesus quickly tells him put it away 'he who lives by the sword dies by the sword.' \n\nWhich in a nutshell is if you're going to be violent, don't  be surprised if someone gets you back. I understand the figure of speech.  I'm confused because Paul is usually pretty measured in his statements but is making little sense in this particular tweet.  That's why I considered the possibility of Paul alluding to something else.\n\nThis simply isn't a case of \"live by the sword die by the sword.\"  If Kyle got killed during a mission in Afghanistan, I guess it would warrant the use of that expression.  However, Kyle's alleged homicide by his friend simply wasn't a case of \"dying by the sword.\" Kyle's violent death at the hands of someone suffering from a disorder caused directly by the kind of violence that Kyle caused in Afghanistan is not \"dying by the sword?\" That case of \"dying by the sword\" is incongruous with the \"living by the sword\" that you just described. I don't see how that's so. The two are the result of the same policy (sword). It's a quote attributed to Jesus in the Bible telling his disciples to be nonviolent. In the garden of Gethsemane Judas comes to betray Jesus with a host of Roman soldiers.

Very strange indeed, and why I'm unsure what to think about it. Although I really seems like more foul play involved with the tweet than the shooting itself, like someone posted on his behalf or something. Using that particular quote makes it seem like Kyle had it coming somehow, and I just don't think that's in line with Dr. Paul's philosophy.

Since Kyle was killed by an apparently malicious third party, I don't think his PTSD or the fact he was at a gun range has anything to do with his death.\n\nMore likely, the fact that he is a mass killer who was glorified by the media is the reason he was targeted. As someone who had never heard of Chris Kyle before, was he the one who had PTSD or was it the guy who killed him?\n\nEDIT: I just looked it up, and Kyle didn't have PTSD.  His killer did. Since Kyle was killed by an apparently malicious third party, I don't think his PTSD or the fact he was at a gun range has anything to do with his death.\n\nMore likely, the fact that he is a mass killer who was glorified by the media is the reason he was targeted.  UPDATE:\n\n[As a veteran, I certainly recognize that this weekend's violence and killing of Chris Kyle were a tragic and sad event. My condolences and prayers go out to Mr. Kyle’s family. Unconstitutional and unnecessary wars have endless unintended consequences. A policy of non-violence, as Christ preached, would have prevented this and similar tragedies. -REP](https://www.facebook.com/ronpaul/posts/10152285499876686)    Who honestly believes that Ron Paul uses twitter, the man is 77 years old.\n\nSome associate of his runs the account, and used a terrible choice of words. It's not uncommon for old politicians to learn to use twitter. Neither is it uncommon for PR representatives to manage social media for politicians, ie. the Obama &amp; Romney presidential campaigns.   Whether or not it's true. The actions of Chris Kyle are not ones I can endorse. I've noticed Right-wingers like O'Reilly seem to engage in the whole hero-worship thing. He even had Kyle on his show. Personally, this further cements my contempt for the political Right. To me, they're no more Libertarian than the Left are. In some ways, they're even worse.  Was this actually written by him or a staffer?\n\nEither way, I don't personally have a problem with it, but it would seem out of character. A staffer? He doesn't hold office and I don't think he's going to run for office. I think he can pretty much say what he wants at this point.     I took it as \"if all you have is a hammer, every problem lookslike a nail. \"\n\n\nMy first thought in hearing of the deaths was \"WTH would they take someone with PTSD to a shooting range??\"   Turns out the familiarity and concentration required is very therapeutic. Unfortunately it didn't work this time.  It might be therapeutic, but it is still stupid.  \"Here, I know you are mentally unstable right now, but have a weapon that could be used to kill someone!  What could go wrong?\"    If by 'dies by the sword' he means Kyle ... he's wrong.\n\nCould have been anybody who got in the guy's way.\n\nAt this time, that it happened at a gun range just seems to be a weird coincidence.\n\nAlso: this bum gives everyone who comes back from the military a bad name.  Most of us come home, settle down, and after our hair grows back and we loose the urge to 'Sir' everyone you can't really tell a veteren from anyone else. Then there are the guys who are 60 and still act like they're active duty even though they served just 3 years and got out when they were 22.          &gt; Thoughts? \n\nRon Paul made a follow up statement, hiding behind his own veteran status. I'm not an A-C, but I don't see the appeal of this guy in these parts.\n\nFor a bunch of anti-statists, there sure are a lot of people here apologizing for a career politician like Paul. &gt; a career politician \n\nDo you happen to know anything about his record other than the fact that he has won re-election a bunch of times? &gt; Do you happen to know anything about his record other than the fact that he has won re-election a bunch of times?\n\nYes. I do. Ron Paul has almost no record. He has introduced over 600 bills in his career and only one has passed. He missed over 90% of his votes last year, the most in Congress. I certainly wish I could get paid to work 10% of the time.",

    "snippet" : "If corporations are inventions of government, but property can only legitimately be owned by individuals, how should property currently \"owned\" by corporations be turned over to individuals?  Simply cease to recognise limited liability. Problem solved. Simply cease to recognize mandated limited liability, but acknowledge that the exact same function would exist in a free market is a more exact answer. Wouldn't it basically be equivalent to moving from implied to explicit contracts? You're free to contract in a manner identical to the current state of things, it's just that there's no longer a single mandatory (well, a few possible options, technically) way these contracts have to be structured. And no one would ever be bound by terms they didn't explicitly agree to. Right? For ease of conversation, yes, though Kinsella points out that dealing with a company named \"XYZ, Inc.\" or \"XYZ Corp.\" could put you on constructive notice of limited liability. Simply cease to recognize mandated limited liability, but acknowledge that the exact same function would exist in a free market is a more exact answer. In that case, wouldn't limited liability only be recognised by those who were part of that contract?  Simply cease to recognise limited liability. Problem solved. Why should stockholders accountable for the actions of management? Should someone that bought BP stock receive a subpoena for $5,000 because of a disaster that they had nothing to do with? Of course, in a free market, managers are able to market shares of their company while assuming the liabilities of their actions.\n\nWe should leave corporations as they are, and just end all government-mandated regulations and subsidies. Why should we use force against corporations like Google, Microsoft, IBM and Smith and Wesson just because they have been the recipients of government funds at some point in their financial history? Let the market decide whether or not they should continue to exist.  The only sense in which corporations are created by government is that individual owners are protected against tort claims against the company. The only difference in the end would be that they would be individually liable for tort claims.   I never understood what was wrong with corporations.  They are legal entities that only exist because of government. I don't see why a state is necessary for a corporation to exist, the structure seems to use mechanisms consistent with normal contracts.  The state isn't necessary for a *business* to exist (i.e. a person or group of people willingly united toward some commercial goal), but the purpose of the word \"corporation\" is to refer to the additional features a state provides to a business (like limited liability, \"personhood,\" etc.). The state isn't necessary for a *business* to exist (i.e. a person or group of people willingly united toward some commercial goal), but the purpose of the word \"corporation\" is to refer to the additional features a state provides to a business (like limited liability, \"personhood,\" etc.). Why can't stateless law provide for limited liability and personhood? Shareholders are protected via contract, so that instead the corporation can acquire debt. This debt can then be paid off via bonds. To me it looks like a legitimate contract system. \n\nAnd keep in mind, those in the company who make criminal decisions can be held personally accountable.  What happens in a situation where the corporation cannot get finance for it's liability? Why should the people whom the corporation owes be stuck with the debt? They were not party to the limited liability contract. That's part of the risk of buying a corporation's bonds. If the corporation goes bankrupt you lose your money and the stock holders are not liable.\n\nAs long as it's all done under a free and fair contract, what's the problem? There is no need for government regulation. What is the justification for limited liability in a dispute between the corporation and an individual or group who did not agree to recognise limited liability? Why is it ok for a third party to be forced to abide by a contract they were not part of? Why can't stateless law provide for limited liability and personhood? Shareholders are protected via contract, so that instead the corporation can acquire debt. This debt can then be paid off via bonds. To me it looks like a legitimate contract system. \n\nAnd keep in mind, those in the company who make criminal decisions can be held personally accountable.  It certainly is feasible with a contract system. I was merely referring to when government does it. Government doesn't really \"do it\", though. Individuals incorporate into limited liability corporations, and the government only (through its monopoly on legal systems) prevents individuals from going after shareholders of a corporation.\n\nThe only difference is that the courts would be provided privately under anarcho-capitalism. Why can't stateless law provide for limited liability and personhood? Shareholders are protected via contract, so that instead the corporation can acquire debt. This debt can then be paid off via bonds. To me it looks like a legitimate contract system. \n\nAnd keep in mind, those in the company who make criminal decisions can be held personally accountable.  I don't see why a state is necessary for a corporation to exist, the structure seems to use mechanisms consistent with normal contracts.  Joe and Beth want to start a corporation.  Joe goes into the bank and tries to open an account in the corporation's name.  The bank asks whose name the account will be in.  Joe says \"the corporation\".  The bank says \"bzzt, property can only be owned by individuals\". Ever heard of Tenancy in Common/Joint Tenants/Tenants by the Entirety? More than one person can own something under basic common law legal theory. The same would be true for companies.  That's funny because I've been told repeatedly that only individuals can own property.\n\nIf you guys want to switch over to arguing for collective property (which is exactly what Tenancy by the Entirety is), okay, then you're not capitalists anymore.\n\nTo answer my own question: The property of corporations could be put directly in the hands of the workers.  If that happened, sure, let's have \"anarcho\"-capitalism... or rather in that case it would be anarcho-\"capitalism\" since there wouldn't be a hell of a lot of capitalism to speak of.

That's a strawman. You can of course have common property arrangements in a free market, you just have to establish it with contract.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism doesn't mean that every and all human interaction is based on capitalism. It is simply a distinguishment from other anarchist schools that are explicitly against private property.\n\nFurther, if workers created a certain productive facility and limited the use of said facility to worker-members only, then the facility would simply be jointly owned private property. The \"strong\" capitalist anarcho-capitalist would argue that the workers would eventually divide labor and create some sort of membership/ownership hierarchy. \"Weak\" capitalist anarcho-capitalists would argue that in many cases they would have to divide labor between capital managers and wage workers, but in some cases they would not. I fall more on the weak side because I can imagine some scales, types, and phases of production where worker-managed capital could be feasible. I'm not willing to entirely rule out the feasibility of worker coops. Whether they are feasible or not, no ancap would claim they do not have a right to organize how they please. Here's the thing about you guys: If you would focus on the collective and communitarian possibilities, instead of saying shit like \"Well yeah if you really want to I guess,\" then you'd have 95% of the population on your side, because that's what people want.  Instead you're always going on about DROs and contracts and insurance, which are *precisely* the things practically every other person in the world hates *most* about the current society.\n\nAnd these organizations that supposedly would organize boycotts and disseminate information in order for the threat of economic and social consequences for environmental destruction and breaking contracts to have teeth- they would have to be *more powerful* than the corporations and neo-bourgeoisie they're to regulate, or else the cost of hiring PR flunkies to counter the truth-tellers would simply be just another cost of doing business (as it is today).\n\nThose groups have to be organized by someone.  An economy based on solidarity has to be built.  If YOU people would work on these things, instead of trying to push this idea that after we get rid of the state it'll be everyone for themselves, we could have it within a matter of decades.  And do you know what you would be if you got your heads out of your asses and helped create those groups and economic systems?  *Fucking Anarchists.* Anarchists do very little to create their utopias. Mostly they protest against the branches rather than the roots, chant slogans, push radical feminism/cultural marxism, and apologize for totalitarian states. A few will incite union action or flaccidly engage in gift economies and petty-bourgeois coops.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists reject the idea that economies are organized or planned. Central planning runs counter to the free market, which is based on adaptation and spontaneous order. The market is inherently decentralized, the actors responding to individual values, not ideological concerns.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists tend to be productive compared to the leftists. Many are business owners, investors, economists, and entrepreneurs. The Sea-Steading  Institute is doing well, Bitcoin is doing well, Cody Wilson's Defense Distributed has some gained mainstream attention, free market charter cities are being proposed (the most infamous unfortunately being Glenn Beck's proposed libertarian enclave, but there are others, less ironic), the Free State project has gained mainstream attention and seems to be doing well, Libertarians are making in-roads into mainstream American politics, and Austrian Economics is becoming more widely discussed partly thanks to Ron Paul.\n\nAll in all, anarcho-capitalists are a far more productive and entrepreneurial group than radical leftists. The radical left has ditched economics in favor of cultural Marxism and prophetic whining.  That's funny because I've been told repeatedly that only individuals can own property.\n\nIf you guys want to switch over to arguing for collective property (which is exactly what Tenancy by the Entirety is), okay, then you're not capitalists anymore.\n\nTo answer my own question: The property of corporations could be put directly in the hands of the workers.

I never understood what was wrong with corporations.  * The state has ~~provide~~ provided limited liability for corporations with regards to 3rd parties.\n* The state uses corporations to play tax games.\n &gt;The state uses corporations to play tax games.\n\nNo, people use corporations to play tax games. I can hardly fault someone for trying to keep their wealth, especially if they can shirk the robber by using the robber's own tools.  I never understood what was wrong with corporations.  &gt; I never understood what was wrong with corporations.\n\nPeople choose to incorporate their businesses for 2 major reasons:\n\n1. It's a special tax bracket for business income. That way you can earn money for your business and not have it taxed as individual income.\n\n2. It reduces liability. As a corporation, unless you do something very criminal, your liabilities are limited by what you have in the business. So if a accident happens and a customer sues you they can't go after your house or child's college fund or anything like that. \n\nPeople who actually know how businesses work tend to object to #2.   They think that individuals should be liable for their actions whether or not they performed those actions as part of a business or not. \n    &gt; property currently \"owned\" by corporations\n\nPardon my ignorance but the corporations in turn are owned by individuals.  Trying to divest property from people is theft.\n\nGranted, with a behemoth like IBM that is many, many, people but the principals are the same.

Suppose there's a factory which employs 200 workers and is owned by 12,000 stockholders through a publicly-traded corporation.  Which one of those individuals owns the factory? The stockholders. Which one? Which one? Life is short: make your point or wiki the subject.  That's my point.  That you guys have no clue how to get there from here. There is no \"there\". The company would continue to be owned by 12,000 stockholders, or one would be appointed to be the \"owner\" but she would be contractually obligated to follow the wishes of the rest, those wishes determined by certain rules and procedures just like they are now.\n\nThere is a feeling that in a more anarcho-capitalist society smaller companies would naturally have an advantage in that they would face fewer organizational challenges and would be more able to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

What are you even talking about? A corporation isn't an invention of government unless it's protected by government.

A corporation isn't an invention of government unless it's protected by government. Corporations have been around forever, why would they suddenly disappear in an an-cap society?  That's my point.  That you guys have no clue how to get there from here. How do you go from my question \n\n&gt; How can you legitimately deprive people of property?\n\nTo concluding\n\n&gt; That you guys have no clue how to get there from here.\n\n How can you possibly determine who the property of a corporation, since as I've been told repeatedly in other threads that only individuals can own property, if you have potentially tens of thousands of people currently owning that property?  If they own it \"together\" that means it's not owned by an individual. &gt;since as I've been told repeatedly in other threads that only individuals can own property\n\nI don't believe this is true. Allow me to explain:\n\nProperty is a tool used to mediate conflict between two parties. When party A and party B disagree on how an object is used, a property right may be negotiated that grants ownership to one of those parties, and settles the conflict. What's important here is that saying \"both A and B own the object\" fails to resolve the conflict between them. Property must differentiate between parties to a conflict for it to be effective at resolving that conflict.\n\nSo while I don't think \"only individuals can own property\" is precisely correct, it's a decent approximate argument in response to a collectivist argument that claims taxation is legitimate because all the people in the country own the country. In such a case, the conflict is between the tax payer and the tax collector, so it doesn't do any good to claim that both the tax payer and the tax collector own the property in question. In this case, property needs to be defined at a more granular level to resolve the conflict, and sometimes that means going as far down as the individual level.\n\nHowever, when multiple people can agree on how some property should be managed, there's nothing wrong with them coming together and collectively owning it. Their conflicts are with people outside the collective, so their ownership only needs to differentiate people in the collective from people out of the collective. How can you possibly determine who the property of a corporation, since as I've been told repeatedly in other threads that only individuals can own property, if you have potentially tens of thousands of people currently owning that property?  If they own it \"together\" that means it's not owned by an individual. &gt; property currently \"owned\" by corporations\n\nPardon my ignorance but the corporations in turn are owned by individuals.  Trying to divest property from people is theft.\n\nGranted, with a behemoth like IBM that is many, many, people but the principals are the same.  And a whole lot of incorporated companies are small businesses like the shop my wife used to own.\n\nThe same process you are talking about - taking away a building from IBM - is no different than coming into my wife's store and liberating her stock 'for the people'.\n\nHow can you legitimately deprive people of property? IBM hardly dominates IT markets compared to other IT companies. I am old and can almost remember when IBM and 'IT' were synonymous.\n\nFeel free to substitute the IT bogeyman of your choice.\n\nThe question remains. I did not know that IBM has greater market share than Apple or Samsung.     &gt;If corporations are inventions of government,\n\nThey're not. Corporations at their core are a pooling of assets to create a \"legal fiction\" where debtors are to only go after the value of the coporation. Tort liability is also, correctly I would add, not extended to shareholders who are not the tortfeasor.  &gt;\"legal fiction\"\n\nAKA an invention of the government No. Let's say I open a business, a sole proprietorship, and call it \"Steenalized Industries.\" Just a hint, Steenalized is not my real name. The existence of 'Steenalized Industries' is equally a legal fiction, it is just a holding name, a business name, not a creation of the government.  That's not a corporation.  That's a sole proprietorship. &gt;No. Let's say I open a business, **a sole proprietorship,** and call it \"Steenalized Industries.\" \n\nI acknowledged that. It's also a legal fiction, just like if I made it a corporation. In either case, I am the entire company. In AnCapistan, I'd likely try to persuade my creditors to limit my liability to the company assets, even if I just had a sole proprietorship with no piece of paper declaring me a corporation. Of course, I'd likely be able to get more investments or lower rates if I let them hold me personally liable on the debts. In both instances, as I am the only actor, I am liable personally for tort actions.  &gt;I acknowledged that. It's also a legal fiction, just like if I made it a corporation.\n\nYou're completely missing the problem.  How do you handle the property of CURRENTLY-EXISTING corporations in the transition to Stateless capitalism? There is no problem, that's my point.  The ones that currently exist are owned by many people, not by any one particular individual.  The limit on liability is the construction of government. Owning property with other people is perfectly fine. Remove the limited liability and most or all of the largest corporations will either voluntarily break up or they will be sued into the ground.  &gt;Owning property with other people is perfectly fine.\n\nI've been told repeatedly that only individuals can own property. &gt;Owning property with other people is perfectly fine.\n\nI've been told repeatedly that only individuals can own property.  Corporations are still businesses, so without State support they'll tank or survive subject to the consumer and competition. If you just say \"OK, stateless capitalism starting... Now!\" with these huge mountains of unjustly accumulated capital sitting in the hands of a few, they *will* use that power to entrench themselves.  I know, I know, it's impossible for \"anarcho\"-capitalism to develop States.  Totally impossible. What do you mean by \"entrench\"?  Umm, corporations already have rules for how the shareholders make their will regarding the use of the common property known. All that abolishing government oversight of the process would do would open up new possibilities for contract structures to arise. People could keep using more or less the same model (ultimately I'll have to defer to others with more corporate law experience, but I've heard Kinsella express this opinion before). You'd just need explicit contracts instead of deferring to the few ones the government currently allows. &gt;common property\n\nSo, not capitalism You clearly misunderstand how the term is used around here. I'd feel bad, but since it's been explained literally dozens of times in this thread, it's pretty clear you're not interested in understanding. Your definition of capitalism is absurd.  It comes out to \"Any time anyone other than a State does anything economically productive\". No, it's that anyone may claim unowned resources and then do whatever he desires with them unless it involves interfering with resources someone else has already claimed. What precisely constitutes a claim may be open for debate, but what one does with that property is up to his discretion. He's free to maintain exclusive control and not let anyone else benefit, or he's free to pool his property with other people and agree to whatever contractual terms they all settle upon. This is a corporation. It's not fundamentally different from someone pooling his labor with others according to whatever mutually-agreed-upon rules they create. Thus a commune or coop is viable within a capitalist framework so long as all members who are staking the claim agree to such terms. They just can't force other groups outside of theirs to abide by the same terms. In the same way, a Homeowner's association could have a contractual obligation applied to all who buy into the area it represents (which is thus all claimed land, not unclaimed) as a condition of purchasing that property. Anyone who entered the contract but didn't fulfill the terms would be guilty of aggression. &gt;No, it's that anyone may claim unowned resources and then do whatever he desires with them unless it involves interfering with resources someone else has already claimed.\n\nHunter-gathering: Capitalism! You're certainly dedicated, I'll give you that. And, by definition, each time I've responded I've been the beneficiary of a mutually beneficial exchange, so I can't fault you on those grounds. Still, it would seem like you could find much more profitable uses of your time than engaging in such a poor attempt at trolling. It's certainly your choice, and I'd never dream of coercing you, but seriously, think about it. Hurtling abuse at the handmaidens of fascism is always a good time.  Dude, I'm having trouble determining if you're outright trolling/trying to convert or looking for a real answer, but I'm glad you posted either way.  =)\n\nI consider myself voluntaryist and this is a question I've struggled with.  This question is part of why I'm uncomfortable identifying as an ancap without caveat and arguing \"self-government through contract\"; I think all concentrated power, public or private, should be treated with suspicion.\n\nThere are ideas like Coase theorem that assert that initial allocation of property rights does not affect the market's ability to reach an efficient solution, but that's focused narrowly on externalities.  There are also statistics about accumulated wealth in families and how it dissipates after a few generations.  Taken broadly, those could be reassuring for the distant future.\n\nNeither of those address the problem of corporations who have benefited largely from government granted privilege in the short term, however, which is what I believe you're concerned with.\n\nI do kinda think your line of questioning about flipping a switch might be unintentionally disingenuous?  As far as I'm aware, ancaps subscribe to NAP, so the only way we'd \"switch\" to an ancap society is if the vast majority of people woke up one morning and also rejected initiation of force.  \n\nWere that the case, and coercion was generally unacceptable, doesn't it stand to reason that if a company can't find a way to provide market value absent government, they'd have to adjust quickly or fail?  People would reject a company that tried to become a state or rule based on stifling contracts; people would certainly reject a corporation that spend all it's money to claim a territory against the will of residents.  Right?\n\nI'm not 100% sure I know the conventional ancap answer, but I know where I'd land.\n\nAnyway, absent a magical switch, I consider pursuit of NAP and educating people to be our best path to freedom.  That's a slow progression.  In the short term, I'm concerned with the biggest concentration of power in the world today and how my children and grandchildren can break free of them.  In the long term, I don't see how a company that provides no value and uses contracts as a weapon could succeed in an \"ancap\" society, but I don't actually care too much whether freedom looks like a commune or a giant corporate glass tower, as long as society isn't based around force. \"Non-aggression principle\" is already insanely fanciful on its face, but when taken with the idea that a person's 'right' to let 'their' food rot trumps the right of starving people to take that food, it's clear what it really means.  \"Non-aggression principle\" is a good reason why the proper name for \"anarcho\"-capitalists is really \"Propertarian\" since you think property 'rights' trump human rights.  That is a profound endorsement of mass violence.\n\n&gt;There are also statistics about accumulated wealth in families and how it dissipates after a few generations\n\nSure, like how the French aristocracy dissipated suddenly in 1789.   How should the cotton be picked without slaves? It doesn't matter.\n\nIt seems like all of these posts about \"how will _____ be done without violence?\" are disrupting the cause by diverting the conversation away from the first principles and towards a burying in the minutiae.

    "title" : "Argentina freezes prices to break inflation spiral - New York News",
    "snippet" : "     Talk about a biased headline, huh? What evidence is there that price freezes break 'inflation spirals?' Banning exchanges above certain prices always gives way to hoarding, hiding, and black market exchange, while creating incentives for importers to stop doing business. Maybe \"Argentina freezes prices **in an attempt** to break inflation spiral\" would be more correct but I don't think the headline as written is necessarily biased. \n\nI could write a headline like \"Man wears socks on ears to increase garden yield\" without espousing the belief that what he is doing is going to have the intended effect. \n\nCoincidentally Argentinians have about as much chance of stopping inflation by wearing socks on their ears as they do by simply implementing price freezes.  I prefer \"Argentina freezes prices **in a *futile* attempt** to break inflation spiral.\" Now *that* would be biased No, it would be factual.  I agree with that too. Now I'm pondering the real meaning of \"bias.\"\n   I remember reading that people were buying brand new cars as a hedge against inflation. The value of the car increasing faster than it can depreciate from age. Money not spent on something quickly turning into dust.\n\nQuoting from Wikipedia:\n&gt;Argentina went through steady inflation from 1975 to 1991. At the beginning of 1975, the highest denomination was 1,000 pesos. In late 1976, the highest denomination was 5,000 pesos. In early 1979, the highest denomination was 10,000 pesos. By the end of 1981, the highest denomination was 1,000,000 pesos. In the 1983 currency reform, 1 peso argentino was exchanged for 10,000 pesos. In the 1985 currency reform, 1 austral was exchanged for 1,000 pesos argentinos. In the 1992 currency reform, 1 new peso was exchanged for 10,000 australes. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1992) peso = 100,000,000,000 pre-1983 pesos.   According to Doug Casey [Argentina is the best place in the world to weather the economic crisis.](http://www.caseyresearch.com/cwc/doug-casey-his-favorite-place-world)\n\nIs he off his rocker?

His rationale is that the state is so inefficient there that you can basically ignore the rules and bribe the officials you come into contact with.  Which is true to some extent, but there are plenty of other countries where this is the case.  Personally, I would have chosen Chile or Peru, where there is a much, much stronger free market popular base.\n\nAt the end of the day, it may have been a somewhat emotional decision which he would have post-rationalised later into a \"common sense business decision\".\n\n     ",

    "snippet" : "Doesn't that imply that all property should be redistributed as a precondition for establishing a truly just Stateless-capitalist society?  No. Just because the State allows you to rightfully homestead a piece of land does not make your homesteading illegitimate for the State having allowed it.\n\nEminent domain is another matter. So you'll have no problem awarding all currently-held titles in the US and Canada to the Native American tribes who originally owned them, right? If they can demonstrate homesteading of the particular land in question by themselves or an ancestor then of course the land is rightfully theirs. They have to prove that particular bit of earth was homesteaded by their particular ancestors and taken by force however.\n\nI love when people like you make threads like this and come back with that response. It's so cute how you think you've managed to \"catch me out\" so to speak. That's funny, because ArchonAlarion just said \"The problem is that much of the unjust acquisitions happened many years ago, the victims and aggressors long dead, and the facts of the cases obscured by time.\" And? At least one of you doesn't know what he's talking about (my guess: both). ArchonAlarion is just saying a similar thing to what I am saying, just with less grace and clarity. He probably disagrees with me to a certain extent though, his statements sound more utilitarian than mine in flavour.\n\nDo you have an argument for your \"guess\", or can we consider this discussion over? We can easily show which land was owned by whom.  Assuming you live in North America, when will you be handing over your keys? And how do we do that?

Aren't all current marriages, having been acquired under the state, illegitimate?\n\nI would say no. If the state had not forced them to get a marriage license, wouldn't they still have gotten married? If the state did not lay some nebulous claim to all property within an arbitrary geographical area, wouldn't property still be changing hands for the benefit of both parties?\n\n**Edit:** Hey guys, let's not downvote for disagreement. I'm sure most of you aren't but there are a few who clearly are. His response to this post is a perfectly legitimate one, let's not be petty (you know who you are). That's not the argument.

[deleted] That's my point.  There isn't anyone.  And all of you are working hard to justify keeping the current illegitimate titles maintained at all costs.  Making \"anarcho\"-capitalism either impossible, or exposed as nothing but a way for today's wealthy and their sycophants to solidify their hold on privilege. In an ancap or even more mincap society, even in our mixed society, wealth and property move around a lot. Given this situation even now, a purely ancap society would deviate towards more people having a rightful ownership via capital accumulation. A 1/2 acre lot with a really nice house or a 30 acre lot with a larger house, would all require effort, but no longer require the same effort as now, and certain inefficiencies would dry up as well.\n\ntl;dr - don't think too hard about things as they are and confuse them with how they could be That's not the argument.

You guys have no answer for the most fundamental question of the act of establishing what you espouse. I see lots of answers. Perhaps they just aren't ones you like? I've seen a lot of dodges and moving of goalposts, but no one squarely answering the question.  It's true RanDomino5 that most properties in the world have been acquired unjustly at some point.\n\nThe problem is that much of the unjust acquisitions happened many years ago, the victims and aggressors long dead, and the facts of the cases obscured by time.\n\nI am not for redistribution/restitution unless the victims can prove their case and that the acquisition happened relatively recently. If you are suggesting that *all* property should be redistributed (to whom?) as a pre-condition to establishing a stateless society, then I disagree. It is not a necessary precondition to improving an imperfect world. &gt;The problem is that much of the unjust acquisitions happened many years ago\n\nWhy isn't *every* acquisition that occurs while the State stands fundamentally unjust?  Even if the money and title exchanges hands 'voluntarily' it still occurs in an environment based, at some level, on coercion. Yeah, sucks dude. At some point you have to make due and at least try to change the system marginally for the better.\n\nThe enemy of good is perfect. The environment can never be perfect, but that's no reason to dump the whole system of property and capitalism. One can only cut the gold from the shit and work on making the shit go away. Hey, if you guys want to have property and capitalism, that's your thing.  But just don't try to claim it would be consensual, fair, or just without hitting the reset button on property first.  Shall we start the game of Monopoly with a few having $10,000, some having $1000, and the rest having $50? Past injustices don't echo throughout eternity. Eventually, things even out or the (dis)advantage might become obsolete.\n\nThe monopoly analogy is weak in two ways. The first is that monopoly is a zero-sum game. You can never really gain without someone else losing. Markets and trade occur due to the mutual benefits of exchange. The second is that there are no generations in monopoly. Say if you were to play an infinite number of games, where the players would pass their end cash to another randomly chosen player at the beginning of the next game. Further, players could choose what tiles they occupy, purchase additional boards and players, and produce their own currencies. Any inequities in wealth at the beginning of the first game (the preconditions) would eventually disappear or become obsolete.

Shall we start the game of Monopoly with a few having $10,000, some having $1000, and the rest having $50? I've met people that are not native to the USA, are poor as dirt, and somehow are better off with their tiny little patch of dirt then their parents, their kids will most likely be even better off when they grow up with the opportunities and living standards found here. \n\nNow imagine if we had no taxes? Imagine if even 1/10 the tax money currently gathered went to charities/investment/education/research/healthcare.\n\nPeople in all walks of life would be better off. &gt;The problem is that much of the unjust acquisitions happened many years ago\n\nWhy isn't *every* acquisition that occurs while the State stands fundamentally unjust?  Even if the money and title exchanges hands 'voluntarily' it still occurs in an environment based, at some level, on coercion. &gt;The problem is that much of the unjust acquisitions happened many years ago\n\nWhy isn't *every* acquisition that occurs while the State stands fundamentally unjust?  Even if the money and title exchanges hands 'voluntarily' it still occurs in an environment based, at some level, on coercion. Because not every acquisition requires the state to steal. I don't \"need\" the state to buy a house, it just happens to still exist and get in my way. However, if you are attempting to use the state to take the house (tax liens or unjust eviction/takeover) then it is truly unjust.    If those titles are the only justification you have for the claim to your land, probably. Do you think that bit of paper is the only thing that gives you a legitimate claim? That's a strong contender for \"the definition of capitalism\". Paper justification for possession of land? I prefer calling it \"title-based property ownership\".  Usually referred to as \"private property\" but I think that's too ambiguous. Why does private property require issuance of a title by a government? I don't think most libertarian style capitalists would agree that issuing a government title is what creates private property. On the contrary, i think they would look at such action as an attempt by government to meddle in things that are none of its concern.  Then in order to make the switch to a Stateless capitalist system, all current property ownership has to be thrown out the window, since it's based on nothing. Libertarians typically base it on an act of creation, so its not based on \"nothing.\" There are certainly conflicting claims out there, many hard to provide evidence for. As a matter of conscience, any libertarian that is presented with a viable claim ought to be willing to negotiate with the claimant towards an equitable solution. I would.  How can anyone make a competing claim when the criteria for claims is based on the illegitimate remnants of the illegitimate system? That's not the basis I, or most libertarians, would use. The basis I would use is basically \"Was this land taken forcefully or fraudulently from your ancestors while they were using it?\"  I prefer calling it \"title-based property ownership\".  Usually referred to as \"private property\" but I think that's too ambiguous. Private property is the product of your time, energy, and talents/skills. I also like to include resources in that list, which are presumably a product of the first three. Then that makes selling impossible, because the new owner would have invested no time, energy, or skills into their new acquisition. Then that makes selling impossible, because the new owner would have invested no time, energy, or skills into their new acquisition. But they would have invested some of their resources, which are the product of their time, energy, and/or talents. I presume you mean money.  So what's the statute of limitations on that?  If someone decides to homestead some property that *seems* abandoned, but then the person who previously invested some of their resources comes back and wants it, who wins? Money, or currency, is an abstract concept that represents value. \n\nAnd in the example you cite, no doubt there would be some arbitration service that would adjudicate disputes such as this. They might also settle the dispute amongst themselves. It's also a very complicated situation, the details of which would likely define the statute of limitations.    Why do you think they are all illegitimate?  They were acquired under a corrupt, unjust system.  Therefore they have no ethical basis.   I'm torn. I like to upvote the threads on here that generate hearty discussion, but most of the time that results in me upvoting troll threads. *sigh*.  [Rothbard to the rescue!](http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ten.asp) &gt;It is of course possible that the previously owned land has been abandoned; but the newcomer must not assume blithely that land which has obviously been transformed by man is no longer owned by anyone. He must take steps to find out if his new title to the land is clear, as we have seen is in fact done in the title-search business.\n\nSo if a slice of property has ever been owned by anyone, it can never be homesteaded?  And without taxes to set a condition for ownership or eminent domain to seize it for public good... Yep, if you're not already rich, you're fucked.\n\n&gt;Just as the original Jones was a continuing aggressor against the original Smith, so the modern peasants are being aggressed against by the modern holder of the Jones-derived land title. In this case of what we might call “feudalism” or “land monopoly,” the feudal or monopolist landlords have no legitimate claim to the property. The current “tenants,” or peasants, should be the absolute owners of their property, and, as in the case of slavery, the land titles should be transferred to the peasants, without compensation to the monopoly landlords.\n\nSounds good to me.  Practically all current property ownership is the result of a great crime- whether because an ancestor was tricked by a bank, intimidated by hired thugs, robbed through taxation, or deprived of opportunities by manipulation of the market by the State.\n\nIn fact, if feudalism was illegitimate, and I should think mercantilism for a similar reason (for example the State-forced driving of the English peasants from the villages and into the factory slums, or the mass robbery of the imperialist era), and if we have the right to take the fruits of that crime, then essentially *all* modern wealth and property rightly belongs to the descendants of the people who were disenfranchised; namely, the global proletariat.\n\nThanks, Rothbard!  I never knew you were a revolutionary anarcho-syndicalist! &gt;And without taxes to set a condition for ownership or eminent domain to seize it for public good... Yep, if you're not already rich, you're fucked.\n\nYou think eminent domain is used against the rich *and* for the public good?\n\n&gt;Yep, if you're not already rich, you're fucked.\n\nCause that's the way markets work.\n\n&gt;...then essentially all modern wealth and property rightly belongs to the descendants of the people who were disenfranchised; namely, the global proletariat.\n\n\"The global proletariat\" is not a person. Like all crimes, you need specific victims and specific violators.\n\nAlso, somethings telling me you came here to start a fight rather than try and find out what others opinions are on things or to seek clarity... &gt;You think eminent domain is used against the rich and for the public good?\n\nHey, at least it would be a theoretical solution.  As it is, you guys would apparently have no problem with an intractable landed aristocracy.\n\n&gt;Cause that's the way markets work.\n\nYes, I think that's basically my argument.\n\n&gt;\"The global proletariat\" is not a person. Like all crimes, you need specific victims and specific violators.\n\nOf course, because that ensures that restitution is impossible: Your true goal. &gt;Hey, at least it would be a theoretical solution.\n\nSo basically no then.\n\n&gt;Yes, I think that's basically my argument.\n\nHa, good answer! Wrong, but clever.\n\n&gt;Of course, because that ensures that restitution is impossible: Your true goal.\n\nIf it was anything other than what I described, it wouldn't be restitution. With restitution, the transgressor restores to the victim. The transgressor is the capitalist class.  The victim is the proletariat.  I don't see what's complicated about this.  As I said in my OP, all wealth and property is tainted by theft.  Therefore the only just solution is some kind of redistribution.  I mean, if you guys are serious about \"anarcho\"-capitalism.",

    "title" : "Why isn't their mediation ala Anarcho-capitalistic dogma in black markets?",
    "snippet" : "It seems like a voluntary and self organizing system of dispute resolution would occur in instances where one couldn't use current legal channels. Instead what we see, in the case of drug trafficking, is violence to resolve disputes, theft, etc.\n\nIs this an information flow problem (as individuals have to stay hidden) or a flaw in ancap train of thought. \n\nI personally was leaning towards it being an information problem but was also considering the fact that so much relies on reputation in black market transactions. So I am at a loss.  The Silk Road,  a website that sells illicit drugs, uses mediation very successfully. And yes, it is anarchist in nature (but I'm not sure which flavor of anarchism). The Silk Road's success probably is owed to the establishment of a pseudonymous reputation system. Sellers can build their reputation within the context of that particular market without having to link that reputation to their meatspace identity. The Silk Road,  a website that sells illicit drugs, uses mediation very successfully. And yes, it is anarchist in nature (but I'm not sure which flavor of anarchism).  I think you are right. Voluntary dispute resolution is very dependent on reputation.  Reputation is dependent on being widely know (at least to your customer base).  The black market has be very secretive to avoid the authorities so I suspect this hampers dispute resolution.  Also, the black market often attracts people that are, willing to take risks, and more readily use violence. Most people in the black market know eachother and have relationships (either negative or positive).  That is why violence appears in the first place.  Also, why can't the ancap market attract violent, power hungry leaders like the black market does?  Because the state actively blocks any form of peaceful mediation from occurring and then comes in to \"save the day\" from the \"violent gangsters\". how specifically? Usually with a gun barrel and a series of cages. dont forget the costumes. and the rape and the slavery. Sounds like a good weekend. how specifically? how specifically?  One of the services of the Mafia is brokering deals, *for a favor* (laundering money, etc), or a fee of some kind, flat or percentage.\n\nSo if I was a grocer who didn't want to pay taxes on the produce that I stock on my shelves, I could approach the leader of the local mafia clan, and they would know a farmer who was likewise looking to avoid paying taxes on the produce they sell. No one cheats, i.e. the farmer exchanges only his most rotten or low grade fruit, because no one cheats someone protected by the mafia. Everyone benefits.\n\nIt should come as no great surprise that brokering such an exchange is also very illegal. Sometimes I wish I had a local mafia instead of a local government. You do.  That's what government is.   The mafia at least has the reputation it deserves. One of the rules of the mafia is to never appropriate funds that do not belong to you. The Don isn't the Don for very long, especially if they would leave their successor with unpaid debts. And never steal from the family, or anyone in general, because it's bad business. That's how you lose turf, and gain stoolies.\n\nIt's disrespectful to compare the mafia with a government. \"or anyone in general\"\n\nUm, pretty sure the mafia is responsible for all kinds of thefts. \"or anyone in general\"\n\nUm, pretty sure the mafia is responsible for all kinds of thefts.   Can you imagine how nice it would be for cops to sit outside there waiting for the criminals?      Mediation requires a desire on the part of both parties to settle the matter peacefully. The black market is filled with people who are already willing to break the law and may have no qualms with using violence to solve disputes. Peaceful people are unlikely to become sellers in the black market to begin with. Also, like someone else mentioned, it's hard for a reputation-based system to work in an underground market where vendors are trying to remain as anonymous as possible.        **SHORT VIDEOS -- Black Markets, Prohibition and Crime**\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\n[First 15 Minutes: Why the Government Does Not Own You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EIBCXwQ6QE#t=04m06s)\n\n[Robert Murphy: Black Markets/Mafia vs. Government](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSeYEz67Se4#t=57m20s)\n\n[Robert Murphy on Voluntary Associations vs. Coercive Monopolies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSeYEz67Se4#t=33m35s)\n\n**ESSENTIAL articles on private courts and defense - Osterfeld and Long**\n\n[LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/108yif/two_mindblowing_essential_articles_on_private/)\n\n________________________________________\n[Learn Liberty:What You Should Know About Drug Prohibition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSXKHLkK4jI)\n\n[Stefan Molyneux: Organized Crime vs. Government](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztzv_MyKB24#t=19m20s)\n________________________________________\n[Top 10 Reasons Why the Mafia is Better than the State](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErlI34-0so)\n_____________________________________________\n\n[Thread: What would happen to criminal organizations in an AnCap society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/vqmxq/what_would_happen_to_criminal_organizations_in_an/)\n\nDrug wars are a result of.. well, the War on Some Drugs. Competitors in the drug market cannot resort to any kind of legal means to solve disputes over property, so they must resort to secret violence and fraud.\n\nPeople only tolerate the violence of drug gangs because the State makes it impossible for a peaceful free market alternative to exist.\n\nDrug wars exist now because of the immense profits to be made in drug trafficking. Those profits are ONLY possible because drugs are illegal and the large legitimate producers of pharmaceuticals aren't allowed to come up with incredibly cheap versions of those drugs and market them. The supply is artificially reduced, and the supply that is available is far more dangerous to produce. It creates a situation where only criminals are producing and are making very large % profits. Those large profits make it valuable for them to use force to eliminate competition, etc. Alcohol is a perfect example of this principle. \n\nDuring prohibition, large criminal organizations formed around the supply and distribution of alcohol. It was perfect. Alcohol is quite addictive, the market for it is huge, and when it was made illegal its supply was artificially contracted to drive up the price and profits of those still willing to sell it, ie the criminals. Now look at today, there are no criminal gangs involved in the sale of alcohol. Why? \n\nBecause like every other commodity the price and profits seek a level where violence is too expensive to employ, both in the resources used and in the reputation hit such a company would take. No one would buy more expensive stuff from the criminals when there's a legitimate dealer right around the corner.",

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If markets are not in equilibrium, it is actually possible to have suboptimal employment of resources. Thus, bringing markets towards equilibrium in such a condition could lead to expansion of the use of resources without having to redirect them from other places necessarily. &gt;  If markets are not in equilibrium, it is actually possible to have suboptimal employment of resources.\n\nMarkets are never in equilibrium in the real world. If left unregulated and unhampered, they will employ the resources better than any other means.

Well how does printing money \"stimulate idle resources back into productivity\"?\n\nThis is obviously just a managerial metaphor made to make it *sound* good. ::Enter Keynes' investment and savings \"conundrums.\":: I know some of the arguments. But Hoppe's point is that Keynesians can't answer these basic fundamental questions. Are some of these what Hoppe asked, why mere printing of money makes a country wealthier?\n\nThat was answered as not their position and I've never run into a Keynesian who believed printing money was a path to wealth itself.\n\nWhat they would say is printing of money, if done 'correctly', may be coincidental to economic growth, but only as a means of stimulating production.\n\nAre there other basic questions you would ask them?\n\nThe main problem with debating Keynesians as an Austrian is that Austrians are much more philosophically rich and their points require decent knowledge of epistemology, something hypermathematized schools entirely skip.\n\nTheir reasoning is literally: \"Hey, the natural sciences use a lot of math.  We want to be a science; thus, it follows we need use a lot of math.\" &gt;I've never run into a Keynesian who believed printing money was a path to wealth itself.\n\nI've never seen an economic issue come up where the Krugman-ite solution was not to \"print money\".  Nor has the Fed, headed alternatively by Keynesians or the \"free market Keynesians\" of the Chicago school, ever decided that the best thing to do in a circumstance was to stop printing money for a while. But, do you not see that they would argue credit expansion is merely coincidental with their goal, a means to that end, not the end in itself? Are some of these what Hoppe asked, why mere printing of money makes a country wealthier?\n\nThat was answered as not their position and I've never run into a Keynesian who believed printing money was a path to wealth itself.\n\nWhat they would say is printing of money, if done 'correctly', may be coincidental to economic growth, but only as a means of stimulating production.\n\nAre there other basic questions you would ask them?\n\nThe main problem with debating Keynesians as an Austrian is that Austrians are much more philosophically rich and their points require decent knowledge of epistemology, something hypermathematized schools entirely skip.\n\nTheir reasoning is literally: \"Hey, the natural sciences use a lot of math.

By \"stimulating production\".\n\nYes, Hoppe was imprecise by implying that Keynesians believe that you can just print money to solve world poverty. But if you watch the whole video he is expanding on a point just made by Joe Salerno, who said that you need to take the Keynesian ideas, like that you can just print money to \"jump start\" an economy, and explain them in simple language to expose them. Hazlitt style. Check it out.\n\nAgree with the different approaches. This total disrespect to epistemology is just awkward. It definitely works in our favor ultimately, in \"lay\" debates.

It feels like talking to a brick wall for all the good it does.\n\nThey have an \"answer\" to everything. Insufficient demand for some mysterious reasons. Paradox of thrift. Market failure. It's like fencing a fart -- you think you scored a hit, but there's nothing but air.

So, Professor Krugman, how does expanding the money supply increase prosperity? Keynesians take the credit for moving forward by withholding the carrot from the horse, just out of reach. The horse is always ignored.  I ventured into the /r/politics thread for this article... I made a huge mistake.  That Hoppe video was just dumb, and a good example of how not to argue. Anyone with basic knowledge about keynesian economics know that monetary expansion doesn't just magically create wealth according to the theory. Is this guy really a professor? That's embarrassing. No Keynesian claims it does 100% of the time, but that is literally what they claim in regards to *some* of the time. Nope. You need to read up on theory. I've read General Theory.\n\nWould you like to explain *why* I am mistaken? That Hoppe video was just dumb, and a good example of how not to argue. Anyone with basic knowledge about keynesian economics know that monetary expansion doesn't just magically create wealth according to the theory. Is this guy really a professor? That's embarrassing. If it doesn't create wealth, what is it a theory for? Not economics, for sure.    You don't need to talk about money printing and imaginary capital creation to refute Krugman, his beard refutes his views, he needs to shave that bitch. His beard is his one redeeming feature. It always reminded me of a lob-sided cat.  Krugman also looks like he could be George Clooneys evil, clever, devious brother.",

I want to understand capitalism from base principals.  ~~By what natural right does one claim property?~~  We own things by having the most justifiable claim to them, by reshaping them and working on them, and it is, I think, objectionable to work or change something someone else has already made theirs, unless they abandon it.  ~~Right now, I know, it's because we pay for it and have presumably done some service that justifies it, but the system is already in place.  The companies already have billions, the property deeds have already been doled out, and ownership is entrenched.~~  I want to understand this from the very basics.  So:\n\nSuppose that tomorrow, out of nowhere, we can travel to other planets and bring arbitrarily large amounts of hardware with us to mine/build upon/exploit these planets.  ~~I know this is unrealistic but my question is who, and by what natural right, do they lay claim to anything out there?~~  Not to sound petty, but first come, first serve.  In an ideal, prosperous civilization, people would work to be granted someone else's property, or else make use of abandoned property, or else go and find their own.  ~~With property in the United States, the government claimed right to it first~~, by no right except the permissiveness of the people ... mistakes were made, but we've never been perfect ~~then sold it, then protected what they sold.  Obviously, the US government cannot control space.  So what if I claim a whole planet?  What if I claim just the area my factory sits on?  What if my competitor takes over the resources I claimed out of the blue?  Why can I not claim the whole universe apart from the Earth as mine right now?~~  They can't, everyone would laugh at this just as they would today, and make use of these resources as they were able.\n\n~~The whole concept of \"property\" seems very flimsy to me.~~  *It seems very difficult to enforce, because on one hand, I am being answered that the state and its powerful courts could not exist, and on the other, that people would not give up their lives for companies under an anacap civilization, putting an absolute ceiling on retribution or ability to stop someone else from simply taking a resource out from under you as best they could and two parties basically resigned to calling each other assholes and trying to get public opinion on their side.*   It ~~ironically, despite your protests~~, virtually REQUIRES government enforcement *for maximum efficiency*, otherwise larger companies with greater resources could destroy their competition however they liked, *though not resorting to murder, destruction*.  ~~They could collude into price fixing~~. If any non-monopoly remains, though, they can profit massively by undercutting the status quo.  *I do still worry that hyper-powerful companies without oversight and regulation could abuse the general population once they have the money to afford \"armies\" and \"protection\" not beholden to any law but the promise of wealth.\n\n~~I agree with you right now that the government is the greater evil, as they act with whole righteous authority to take what they want, arrest who they want, kill who they wants, war with who they want, grant monopolies to the businesses they want, subsidize them (whether they're good \"investments\" or not).  Businesses do not have this kind of power, but in an anacap system they would have even more power, being the only means of production of goods and able to afford violence, coercion, protection, etc.~~  The snarky answer was on the money, here:  if we can break our government of its terrible holds on us, we shouldn't be subservient to companies that emulate it, either.\n\nSo work me through the first principles, the right to claim anything as solely your own.\n\n***Edited: Anything I haven't struck through is updated opinion on the matter.

I don't think the social norms regarding dispute resolution are \"designed\" by some territorial community.

The best compromises win and become the norm.   \"gonna get downvoted\"\n\nwho do you think we are? One can conclude that Anarcho-Capitalism is correct simply by observing the difference between us and /r/anarchism.  \"gonna get downvoted\"\n\nwho do you think we are?   Well done for thinking about the justification for property explicitly. I guess you have reached the point where some initial anarchocapitalists realized they were actually mutualists.\n\nI am a proponent of Lockean homesteading, that is: mixing your labour with the land gives a right to property.  But, influenced by Proudhon (and common law), not *nudo animo*, by intent alone, in infinity; If you leave it useless for decades after your initial investment, don't be surprised if someone is squatting on 'your' property.\n\n&gt; So what if I claim a whole planet? Why can I not claim the whole universe apart from the Earth as mine right now?\n\nBecause in these cases, it'd be very hard to show in court that you are using the whole planet or the universe in a beneficial way (assuming you're not actually plowing, or building on, the whole planet)\n\n&gt; What if I claim just the area my factory sits on? What if my competitor takes over the resources I claimed out of the blue? \n\nThis would be a reasonable claim. If your competitor takes over your factory, you would have a right to reclaim damages from them for their agression against your property.\n\n&gt;[this requires government] otherwise larger companies with greater resources could destroy their competition however they liked [once they have the money to afford armies]\n\nYou believe a central army, i.e. government, will be more efficient and better than a protection company that you could hire which could not depend on a tax base, and hence has to be more efficient than its competitor. I don't.\n\nYes, companies can collude into price fixing. However, such cartels are either providing a good enough service that people prefer them over their competition, or there is enough incentive for one of the members to break the collusion and start selling cheaper.\n\n Thank you, what you've said makes a lot of sense, but a few things...\n\n&gt; Because in these cases, it'd be very hard to show in court that you are using the whole planet or the universe in a beneficial way (assuming you're not actually plowing, or building on, the whole planet)\n\nThis relies on the existence of courts powerful enough to enforce their judgements, presumably run by some extremely powerful third party with no vested interests in who wins or loses a settlement (which isn't always the case, even with government, but seems much more likely to be the case if a conglomeration of companies is the \"court\").\n\n&gt; This would be a reasonable claim. If your competitor takes over your factory, you would have a right to reclaim damages from them for their agression against your property.\n\nWithout a powerful interdicting party, this becomes \"eye for an eye\", even \"our competitors have wronged us and will again at the next opportunity, we need to unmake that in the quickest, most economic way possible.  C4 their headquarters and murder all their researchers.\"\n\nI don't want to sound like a bad dystopian novel, but there's a lot of science fiction written about boundless corporate states, where workers have to live under constant surveillance in company dormitories to avoid their capture or worse, where companies fight freely and openly, if only in border skirmish wars at the far bounds of society.  But they toy with people's lives in ways those people probably don't expect when they sign the dotted line.  \n\nAnd while people should have things like oaths and loyalty to word and willingness to work and to work together, and I love serving a function and earning money for doing it, there's a difference between the system I work under, enforced by the government, and the system where a black man in Africa puts his mark on a piece of paper he can't read and has everything taken from him.  Which was also allowed by the governments at the time, but I cannot imagine a world without restriction on contracts, wages, rules regarding work, I fear it would quickly deteriorate into a nightmare.\n\n&gt; You believe a central army, i.e. government, will be more efficient and better than a protection company that you could hire which could not depend on a tax base, and hence has to be more efficient than its competitor.

Most ancaps follow the homesteading principle for land ownership.  If there's a plot of unowned land, the first person to mix their labor with the land is entitled to own it.  \"Claiming\" a mineral deposit means nothing under ancap legal theory - you must make a solid investment in something in order to get the exclusive right to keep using it.  This is pretty fair - only people who are interested in making good use of land will be able to keep others out, and you can't go around arbitrarily wrecking other people's stuff who were there first.  It gets more complicated and there are disagreements about when said property becomes abandoned (I say when you stop insuring it or if you have abandonment agreements with real estate firms), if homesteading land means homesteading airspace above and minerals below (I say no, but future claims must not interfere with pre-existing claims - eg I can't undermine your house because you don't own the land beneath it), how water rights work (I say that you own the watershed of land whose surface you own), and other nuances.\n\nThose are property rights in theory.  You can agree that they're at least a nice principle whether or not they're practically enforceable without a state.  Here's why I think they are.\n\nWe probably agree that people are social and can create more wealth when working together than the sum of separate efforts.  When people do get together, there are nexuses of trust that naturally form.  People are confident in keeping thousands of their hard earned dollars in banks, Silk Road can deliver products to interested buyers far more safely than previous alternatives, and motorists take out insurance policies, knowing that they'll be covered in accidents.  While it is true that the state regulates the first and third, I propose that except in the case of a total or near monopoly, the bigger the institution, the *less* likely it is to break social norms.  In a competitive market, cheaters stand to make a large amount of money in the short run, but none in the long run.  Sometimes this is worth it.  In the old West, a con artist would hastily throw up a flimsy building, claim to be a \"bank,\" and skip town after deposits were taken.  If he hadn't cheated, then he would have gotten a longer stream of smaller income, but he has such a large time preference that he's OK with cheating.  Now suppose he builds a very expensive, fortified building, buys a house, and preemptively agrees to loan some townspeople money.  He's stuck in the town because he made a non-salvageable investment.  Similarly, even as non-state protection agencies grow larger, they'll have more pressure to find the fairest way to treat their customers, since even a small deviation from social norms could damage a very valuable brand.\n\nThis is all assuming competitive markets.  Like you've pointed out, the state already is a monopoly and sucks.  But what's stopping the protection agency market tending towards a monopoly?  The short, smart-ass answer is that if we get to an ancap society in the first place, then we've already figured out how to break a monopoly on force.  The longer one is that collusion does not necessarily work in all markets.  Recently, a bunch of airlines all wanted to raise prices simultaneously, but Southwest stopped them because they'd prefer to compete on volume and knew that as long as they priced above their marginal cost they could suck business away from the airlines who raised their prices and make more money.  As firms try to move prices above their product's marginal cost, each firm has an incentive to chisel the price back down to marginal cost.  Even though it'd be better for all firms as a whole if they raised their prices all at the same time, each individual firm has agency and noncooperation is the dominant strategy. I think you've raised a lot of good points, but I'm addressing some of them with other commenters (you guys are way friendlier and more helpful than I expected, no offense, which I'm happy to find out!), but I just thought of something reading your comment:\n\n&gt; Recently, a bunch of airlines all wanted to raise prices simultaneously, but Southwest stopped them because they'd prefer to compete on volume and knew that as long as they priced above their marginal cost they could suck business away from the airlines who raised their prices and make more money.\n\nThis works in a lot of ways because of existing laws.  If all those other airlines lived in a non-governed state, they could sabotage (even if subtly and rarely) Southwest's aircraft, or they could just all participate in a massive, slanderous ad campaign.  Sure, southwest could compete insofar as it's able to buy advertisements that its competitors can't buy out, otherwise, they're done, collusion engaged.  It is always, and only, a question of *if it's cheap enough to do*, and I fear the answer might be \"yes\" for some long-run, massive-sunk-cost industries like airliners.  If another competitor appears after southwest, they can be shutdown with even less effort.

What happens if this escalates out of control absent any governing body?  As an anarchist at heart (but who thinks it is impossible in practice), I would be happy to live a few miles from that mountain if we could all be civilized, decent humans to each other, but if those two corporations started massacring each other on the spot, I'd keep my head low.  Only they could stop themselves, I'd just be left with regret for daring to live near some useful resource... http://www.bigheadpress.com/tpbtgn\n\nthis graphic novel was my introduction, can't remember where I was introduced to it about a year ago, but I've read it 3 times now.

We try to keep the circle jerking to a minimum. Hope some of the answers here helped. I'll throw in my 2 cents. \n\nThe most basic principle is that people ought to be free. Part of that freedom includes the ability to engage in dealings with other people without a third party intervening. Many people get hung up on anarchism because they believe it would not be possible to provide the same level of safety that government provides. First, the 20th century showed pretty well that government is an instrument of massive violence, not protection. Second, that argument is illegitimate because it presumes that some people can rightfully make decisions on behalf of others. None of us signed the constitution (or similar non-us document). Yet we are bound by the decisions of our rulers. Leaving any particular country is not a solution since states currently rule the entire world. And, anyways, I shouldn't have to flee my home to escape the rule of others.  I think tovsome extent you just opened up a big can of worms regarding things being decided for us.  Say I'm 12 in AnarchyLand, and I don't want to continue abiding some local rule (don't skateboard down the street, I guess) just because I was born there.  I could lay down some outcomes that would vary based on the \"neighborhood law\" that might be present, but most of it does come down to it *always being okay to dispense with consent of the \"governed\" under some circumstances*.  It would be absurd to do it any other way, and that's the opinion expanded on by anyone who's not an anarchist.\n\nAll that said, thanks for the additional insight.",

    "snippet" : "Inspired by a debate-a-communist thread, where the general consensus was the statist social-safety nets were required by liberalism in order to prevent popular revolt\n\nEdit: I'm much more interested in people answering my question than I am in being questioned about my own personal politics.  Buy a drone with bitcoin dawg and use it to mow down the rioting masses? It solves the problem, I guess, but its ridiculously brutal. I can't see people anyone other the egoist psychopaths being able to do such a thing. Only a mass of rioting psychopaths would attack and steal from people better off than them. It's self defense.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure he was kidding about the drone. Well, if people are having trouble being unable to feed themselves or get shelter, and there is adequate food or shelter that is owned by others simply unavailable to them because they don't own it, riots will happen. Its been proven true throughout history, and unless there was weird temporary outbreaks of mass psychopathy that came and went, mental illness has absolutely nothing to do with it. You know what else history has proven? That poor people are much better off in free market societies than they are in statist shitholes.\n\nWould you like to compare the living standards and starvation rates between South and North Korea? All free market societies are also statist shitholes. Do you have any examples of free market societies that aren't statist? I have no idea what you're trying to prove here. I'm pointing out the the situations that cause such outbreaks to develop are much more prone to occur in societies that depart from free market principles. By all accounts, history has shown the people are much better off when capitalism is free to take its course.\n\nNot that revolts wouldn't occur in ancap societies, but if the people revolting hated capitalism so much, why would they choose to live in an area with strong market forces? How exactly would someone living in an area with shitty employers that don't play a living wage be able to move elsewhere into a land of milk and honey? Required [living wages](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca8Z__o52sk) make the poor even poorer. Only a mass of rioting psychopaths would attack and steal from people better off than them. It's self defense.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure he was kidding about the drone. So who would decide, say, someone is taking food from your pantry, whether or not it is legal or illegal to shoot them dead?\n\nOr say you own a grocery store, and there is a raid happening by workers who are unhappy with their wage? Similar things have happened in the past throughout history, and have happened in Spain a few months ago. Would it be self defense to bring in the predator drones on them? If someone is breaking into my house, then it's justified for me to defend myself. Ideally, you wouldn't kill the guy, maybe shoot him in the leg or something. It would be extremely difficult to target criminals and not hit innocent people using drones(Obama's killing of brown children in the middle east is proof of that), so it wouldn't be practical in most situations.\n\nPrivate, armed security guards outside of your residence and/or business would quell most attempts at theft. I'm more curious about how you'd defend your private property rather than your personal property, such as factories, stores, etc.\n\nAnd in the original question, I'm talking about massive anti-capitalist insurrection, though. I'm sure you're familiar with this, right? Historically there's tons of examples, but recently its happening in Greece, parts of Mexico, Spain, and Argentina. Would would happen if, in the company that you own, all the workers revolt and \"fire you as their boss\", and start to run it themselves. This happens all the time during periods of capitalist bust, and usually its the state who intervenes and squelches the insurrection (or in cases of high profile revolt, it can even turn into civil war). How would an anarcho-capitalist society prevent against this?

Here you are essentially making a plea to **primitive ethical intuitions** that what is \"in the household\" is okay to defend, but title-based property isn't. It's an anachronism whereby you excuse the familiar, handheld, and inhabited as legitimate property, and then attempt to justify the breach of title-based property rights. There is no difference between the personal and private to the civilized person, only to the paleolithic person who lived in a world without contract or trust. So if workers in your store started spontaneously stealing product, you would shoot them (aiming for the leg)? It would depend on a multitude of factors related to what was being stolen, how the theft was being carried out, the consequences I could predict, and the history I had with the workers.\n\nIf workers started randomly stealing shit and rioting out of the blue, I or my guards (aren't they workers too?) would do something to try gaining control of the situation (warning shots, calling for help, locking doors, speaking to workers, etc.). If the workers continued with some demonic, ridiculous glean in their eyes I would start the shooting and escalate as necessary.\n\nOf course, I doubt worker riots would be at all frequent in an actual free-market society (unlike most contemporary and historical eras and settings you are likely to draw from to prove your strawman). &gt;I'm more curious about how you'd defend your private property rather than your personal property, such as factories, stores, etc.\n\nThe difference between capitalists and anti-capitalists is that we understand how vital private property is to the individual and society.

So if workers in your store started a steal-in, you'd shoot them all, aiming for the legs?  Labor is forever scarce and capitalists can always use more laborers, especially when there's no minimum wage they must be paid.  This means capitalists, if profit be their goal, will always seek to productively employ those \"less-off.\"\n\nThe incentive structure for the \"less-off\" laborers is attain a criminal reputation, which would be very costly to rehabilitate, with an expected cost that would greatly dwarf any short-run booty (the exact reason why the market as a means of cooperation exists and a civil society is even known about, as opposed to humans being cannibalistic hermaphrodites) or cooperate in an employ that will be much more productive than working by themselves.\n\nThis means few rational actors will choose a life of crime, if they have long-term interests for themselves.  Add onto this private law and security and you'll have a system where crime is even less existent.\n\n&gt;where the general consensus was the statist social-safety nets were required by liberalism in order to prevent popular revolt\n\nThe ironic thing is it's actually *because of* them and the hyperregulation of employment why revolt is more likely to occur. Without a minimum wage, I imagine you're at risk of not getting a living wage from your employees. There are plenty of places without minimum wages and with very low employment that have strong militant labor movements, that often end up with riots.\n\nDo you have any kind of statistics or studies or data that backs up what you're saying. Sure, it sounds nice in theory, but I can't see that really happening in practice. It seems too utopian to me. &gt; minimum wage\n\nall minimum wage does is keep people unemployed. claiming that it can do anything else is not just utopian, but empirical falsehood. &gt; minimum wage\n\nall minimum wage does is keep people unemployed. claiming that it can do anything else is not just utopian, but empirical falsehood. citation? \n\nAnd regardless, do you think it is possible for all employers to pay all employees a living wage, and not have unemployment?

Sure, it sounds nice in theory, but I can't see that really happening in practice. It seems too utopian to me. &gt;I imagine you're at risk of not getting a living wage from your employees.\n\nNot at all.  Food has demand primacy (you even implicitly agree by citing it as a potentially serious problem).  It may be sold cheaply in an advanced economy, but, even in a primitive economy, it would have much higher dedicated production.  So, the market always pursues production of those goods most in demand dynamically and towards a rational allocation; even when the market gets disrupted by arbitrary regulation, it still grinds toward a momentary equilibrium.\n\nAnother way to look at what you're saying as misguided is by understanding that an arbitrary increase in the \"less-off's\" income is going to raise the demand for food and, thus, its price, ceteris paribus.  So, the term \"living wage\" has no non-circular meaning, and, thus, disarms your objection (Humans have been able to provide for themselves plenty of food for thousands of years; starvation is really more political than economic).\n\nPeople like not starving and are prepared to dedicate the vast majority or all of their income to food, if need be.  Whatever that income is, nominally, will be reflected in a great deal in the actual nominal price paid for food.  Market exchanges imply divisions of labor whose productivity incentivize many to give up on procuring their own food, leaving it to an enterprise more efficient, so they can pursue a higher income.\n\nThe tl;dr: markets take care of their participants.\n\n&gt;There are plenty of places without minimum wages and with very low employment that have strong militant labor movements, that often end up with riots.\n\nWell, a minimum wage is only one in a plethora of ways that the market for labor can be dislocated.\n\n&gt;Do you have any kind of statistics or studies or data that backs up what you're saying. Sure, it sounds nice in theory, but I can't see that really happening in practice. It seems too utopian to me.\n\nYou know about the term \"anarcho-capitalist,\" but you don't know what the Austrian rebuttal is to this? I reject austrian economics entirely. Believing in it requires more faith than your run-of-the-mill sky fairy. Then why even come here? to ask questions? Just because I don't agree with something doesn't mean I'm not interested in learning about it. I like to keep an open mind. It seems rather pointless though doesn't it? The answers you will get will mostly be comprised based off the Austrian theory. Clearly, you have already written off Austrian theory as wrong (comparing it to fairies), which means you will consider all our answers wrong. \n\nIf you REALLY want to learn about the Austrian theory and Anarcho-Capitalism I suggest looking at professional works instead of coming to reddit. You should read some of David Friedman's works. \n\n I've read Friedman, I've read Mises, I've read Rothbard. I know it all. I just asked one question, yet nobody seems to be willing to answer it, and are instead saying \"In an anarcho-capitalist society, they're *obviously* be no poverty\". I wasn't the one to bring up economics at all. Now you're putting words into mouths. No one said there would be no poverty. \n\nThe problem is that your question can't be answered because there is no way to test it. Therefore, the answers you will get will all be based off theory, which you happen to disagree with. End of story. I've read Friedman, I've read Mises, I've read Rothbard. I know it all. I just asked one question, yet nobody seems to be willing to answer it, and are instead saying \"In an anarcho-capitalist society, they're *obviously* be no poverty\". I wasn't the one to bring up economics at all. Several people here (myself included) have given you an answer to your question.  Stop lying. I've read Friedman, I've read Mises, I've read Rothbard. I know it all. I just asked one question, yet nobody seems to be willing to answer it, and are instead saying \"In an anarcho-capitalist society, they're *obviously* be no poverty\". I wasn't the one to bring up economics at all. I reject austrian economics entirely. Believing in it requires more faith than your run-of-the-mill sky fairy. You \"believe\" in Austrian economics like you \"believe\" in maths. It is simply a useful theory that informs actual decision making. I reject austrian economics entirely. Believing in it requires more faith than your run-of-the-mill sky fairy.    I think your question rests on a premise that most people thinking about an AnCap society do not agree with.  Namely that there will be enough poverty that this would be an issue and that the society would not have adopted as a norm something like the NAP.\n\nSo, presuming there are masses of poor who do not recognize something like the NAP as the basis of ethical behavior:\n\nIf individuals violate property they will be repelled and compensation will be sought for any damage by the property owners DRO.  Anyone who is known to disrespect property rights will likely have a low reputation score and can lose access to other people's  more public-esque property (like roads and stores).\n\n---\nAlso you might find the side-bar or a search of the subreddit helpful (this is not exactly an uncommon question). So you think its impossible for there to be impoverished desperate masses at all in an ancap society? I think the general thoughts of those who subscribe to the Austrian school is that poverty as it exists today will tend to decrease the longer the system is in place.  I am not sure I subscribe to Austrian economics specifically (its pre-scientific enlightenment thinking bothers me somewhat).  I would say that with the barrier to entry to the market being as low as is likely in a completely free market that the number of poor would decrease and the quality of life of the poor (on average) would increase.\n\n---\nNone of this is an actual response to my answer to your question though. &gt;(its pre-scientific enlightenment thinking bothers me somewhat)\n\nYou say that like the enlightenment period was philosophically more significant than what came before it (and not just nonphilosophical historians' treatment of it). I think you misunderstand my tone.  The enlightenment, and specifically the discovery of the scientific method were a progression from previous thought.  Ideas from before the enlightenment can be valid (the logical absolutes and the idea of particles making up matter predate enlightenment rather significantly).  The problem is that before the enlightenment the method of testing these ideas was flawed, thus science.\n\nSo, when there are unfalsifiable claims made, like those of the foundation of Austrian economics, which science *can not address* I can not (as a skeptic and scientist) claim that these ideas must be correct simply through reasoning.  I am agnostic about them.  I put only as much faith in those ideas as I do in other unfalsifiable ideas, namely as much as reality requires me to (like the denial of hard solipsism).  I think, in the end, Agorism will allow for a demonstration that the Austrian economists are right (or allow for correcting anything that is not right). &gt;specifically the discovery of the scientific method\n\nThe Scientific Method is nothing but the codification of what humans had already been doing for thousands of years.  Even other animals think similarly in the small way they're capable of, of trying to tease out understanding of causalities from interaction within the world in which they live, so that they can better satisfy their ends.\n\n&gt;The problem is that before the enlightenment the method of testing these ideas was flawed, thus science.\n\nNo, the thinking has always been in every age; the only thing that separates them is technological progress, which affects what one may confidently test.  You act like there weren't tests done prior to the \"Enlightenment.\"  You think, when a couple methods of creating fire were first discovered by primitive men, they didn't attempt to isolate what were the necessary conditions for its creation, by experimenting with the presence and absence of various factors?  That is textbook scientific reasoning.\n\n&gt;I can not (as a skeptic and scientist) claim that these ideas must be correct simply through reasoning\n\nDo you know what analytic reasoning is?  Rationalism is hardly mutually-exclusive to skepticism and Science; indeed, the hardest-core skeptics *are* rationalists, and the foundation of Science--Philosophy of Science--is *all about* its rationalist roots.\n\n&gt;I put only as much faith in those ideas as I do in other unfalsifiable ideas\n\nSo, you require \"faith\" in a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ?  Pretty incredible. &gt;The Scientific Method is nothing but the codification of what humans had already been doing for thousands of years. Even other animals think similarly in the small way they're capable of, of trying to tease out understanding of causalities from interaction within the world in which they live, so that they can better satisfy their ends.\n\nThis is a half-truth.  The scientific method replaced ended up subsuming analytic reasoning and gave a better understanding of the standard of evidence for having a rational justification for a belief in a truth claim.  It also applies to non-causal things, and is particularly good at pointing out when correlated events occur but are not causal.  Neither of which is distinctly true of pure Aristotelian reasoning.  I would not call what lower animals do 'scientific' so much as it is them expecting history to repeat its self.  That is not an investigation of the underlying mechanism.\n\n&gt;No, the thinking has always been in every age; the only thing that separates them is technological progress, which affects what one may confidently test.\n\nThis is (aside from being a gramatical mess) patently false.  It was considered perfectly acceptable for the wise and educated to assume through pure reason that something was true if they could not falsify the premises.  Some of the premises they accepted rested upon devine intervention or inspiration, and they saw nothing wrong with that.  With  the scientific method one gets methodological naturalism (or you could say it the other way, I do not think the distinction is important).  This did lead directly to technological advancement.\n\n&gt;Do you know what analytic reasoning is? Rationalism is hardly mutually-exclusive to skepticism and Science; indeed, the hardest-core skeptics are rationalists, and the foundation of Science--Philosophy of Science--is all about its rationalist roots.\n\nYou can not claim something is true through pure 'analytic' reasoning.  Only observation is enough to make that claim.  That is 'hard-core' rationalism.\n\n&gt;So, you require \"faith\" in [presumably the pythagorean formula with no context] ? Pretty incredible.\n\nIt is not faith if the space is Euclidean and a, b, and c describe the sides of a triangle in that space.  Unfortunately not all space is Euclidean, and not any three variables describe the legs of a triangle.  You can pick again if you feel like it, but if your question was supposed to be something like 'do you have faith that math works' then the answer is no.  I have a justified belief that math works because I test it.  Sometimes math gives perfectly valid mathematical answers which are not physical, that is why math is not the only part of science (merely a good language to write it in if one is properly rigorous). &gt;This is a half-truth.\n\nI'm not sure there's anything more frustrating than reading writing that presupposes expertise while not having it.  After reading your responses each iteration, I barely resist the urge to laugh and walk away.  Your position would be better served by asking me questions, rather than presuming to inform me, while providing me nothing but muddled reasoning.\n\nThat being said,\n\n&gt;The scientific method replaced ended up subsuming analytic reasoning and gave a better understanding of the standard of evidence for having a rational justification for a belief in a truth claim.\n\nYou probably don't even know who Kuhn was and are a die-hard falsificationist (hell, maybe you believe things actually can be proven; at this point, I shouldn't assume any philosophical sophistication).\n\n&gt;I would not call what lower animals do 'scientific' so much as it is them expecting history to repeat its self.\n\nHow modest.\n\n&gt;aside from being a gramatical mess\n\nOr your reading comprehension inexperienced, leaving you fewer ways in which to read sentences.\n\n&gt;Some of the premises they accepted rested upon devine intervention or inspiration, and they saw nothing wrong with that. \n\nYeah, examples of religious dogmatists disproves the existence of those capable of scientific reasoning.  Your claim rests on the supposition that Man one day ran into a new way of thinking that he was utterly incapable of before (we'll leave aside how he even then ran into it for the moment) and, now that he has discovered it, must pass it down onto other generations and inculcate it in them, lest we return to the \"dark\" ages.\n\nPretty incredible theory you have there, sir.  I wonder then how I was capable of scientific reasoning before I was even \"taught\" the formal method (and, by \"taught,\" I actually mean was *not* taught, as what is presented in most science classes is falsificationism, something not actually believed technically possible by philosophers of Science.  I've only had one professor who knew who Kuhn even was.  They don't even teach Philosophy of Science in graduate level natural science programs, of all places.)\n\n&gt;This did lead directly to technological advancement.\n\nYes, we LITERALLY had no technology before the Enlightenment.  Then, something happened, and we had BOATLOADS of technology.  I guess this removes all doubt your position couldn't be seriously posed.\n\n&gt;You can not claim something is true through pure 'analytic' reasoning. Only observation is enough to make that claim. That is 'hard-core' rationalism.\n\nDo you even know what Mathematics *is*?

Yeah. As a scientist myself, I am very very very wary of any conclusions and methodology of austrian economics. Yeah. As a scientist myself, I am very very very wary of any conclusions and methodology of austrian economics. Well, you should know that sound reasoning is one way to generate a hypothesis, and in my opinion that is what Austrian economics is.  Agorism is well on its way to testing the predictions. &gt;that sound reasoning is one way to generate a hypothesis\n\nIt's the *only* way.\n\nಠ_ಠ Actually no.  Science typically requires inductive reasoning.  Unfortunately inductive reasoning presumes you understand something about a system.  It is possible to generate hypotheses  deductively, it is also possible to simply guess and test.  Using this last method there are automated programs that generate mathematical hypotheses and then let researchers test them in order to fully sample a phase space of possible hypothesis (which a human might not do). &gt;Actually no.\n\nlol, this is going to be fun.\n\n&gt;Science typically requires inductive reasoning.\n\nTypically, or always -- which is it, if you know it?\n\n&gt;Unfortunately inductive reasoning presumes you understand something about a system.\n\nConfident that you understand something well enough; all observations are theory-laden, yes.\n\n&gt;It is possible to generate hypotheses deductively\n\nIt's the only way; you're not understanding what I'm really saying.  All thinking is actually deductive; even induction is a form of deduction.  The only difference is that induction presumes validity of empirical data.  It says, \"if my observations A and B are true, and our theories C, D, and E remain true, F must be the case about this reality.\"\n\nInduction is not me opening up a flap of my brain and \"letting in data\" from the \"real\" world (rofl).  These \"two\" reasonings are really one.\n\n&gt;it is also possible to simply guess and test\n\nEven \"guessing\" is done with something in mind.  Mises had handled this issue well in the beginning of Human Action.\n\n&gt;that generate mathematical hypotheses\n\nDo you know how computers work?  A CPU has billions of CMOS transistors that can act as logic gates.  These logic gates emulate human *deductive* reasoning.  CPUs simply spit out whatever follows from billions of logical operations on given premises.  There is nothing *categorically* different about this act, only the speed at which it occurs. &gt;Typically, or always -- which is it, if you know it?\n\nAll reasoning after a hypothesis is generated must be inductive.  As I said, generating an initial hypothesis need not be inductive.  Most of the work is done post-hypothesis, thus I said 'typically.'\n\n&gt;Confident that you understand something well enough; all observations are theory-laden, yes.\n\nThat is backwards I think, and missed the point of what I was saying.\n\n&gt;It's the only way; you're not understanding what I'm really saying. All thinking is actually deductive; even induction is a form of deduction.\n\nYou clearly did not read what I wrote.  It is possible to have a computer algorithmically (or pseudo-randomly) generate hypothesis to be tested.  I hope we can agree that 'random' generation to sample a phase space is not deductive (or inductive, though its purpose is inductive).\n\n&gt;Induction is not me opening up a flap of my brain and \"letting in data\" from the \"real\" world (rofl). These \"two\" reasonings are really one.\n\nNice straw man.  No, they are not one form of reasoning.  They are different in methodology and intent, they are foils of each other.  Unfortunately for us, deductive reasoning can lead to false predictions when premises are mistakenly included.  Inductive reasoning does not allow for this since the conclusion was not being constructed by adding premises but rather is generated by whichever observations happen to be included (accounting for statistical sampling errors).\n\n&gt;Even \"guessing\" is done with something in mind. Mises had handled this issue well in the beginning of Human Action.\n\nHaving 'something in mind' is not a form of reasoning, or at least not a valid one.  Also, as I have pointed out, the guessing can be done by a third party with no agenda (a computer), something I suspect Mises does not say much about.\n\n&gt;These logic gates emulate human deductive reasoning. CPUs simply spit out whatever follows from billions of logical operations on given premises. There is nothing categorically different about this act, only the speed at which it occurs.\n\nYou again discount randomness.  Believe it or not, generation of very random sampling can be done.  A human is still sometimes required to bound the space the computer samples, though I believe there are programs which set their own bounds for creating 'interesting' problems.  The fact that this can be done on a deterministic tool is not the point because the input can be random (or very, very close to it).  This is a cornerstone of a lot of advances in information theory and computational physics.\n\n---\n\nNone of this is the point, it is a pissing contest (which by its nature I think you are losing and you presumably think I am losing).\n\n* Austrian Economics is foundationally unfalsifiable.  True or False:\n\n* Belief in something without evidence is irrational. True of False:\n\n* Pure reasoning, alone, is not evidence. True or False:\n\n* A claim which is unfalsifiable is untestable and can generate no empirical evidence.  True or False:\n\nI answer 'True' to all of those statements, which leads me to my original objection to Austrian Economics.  Feel free to argue one of those premises.   I find it somewhat funny that, in particular, a lot of the Randists argue this line of thought, and say the poor would have too much power, while others argue that the rich and wealthy would take over because they would have all the soldiers and money. To sort of flip this, why do you not think the rich with their private armies and resources would be able to protect themselves?  Nobody will and can answer this question. Most AnCaps subscribe to the austrian economics and reject the notion that real poverty will even exist to the degree that it is a real issue. Anarcho Capitalism at this stage is a utopian ideology like communism and you'll find most supporters arguing that all bad shit and failures humanity showed and did over the arch of history can be attributed to a flaw in the system (\"statism is a mental ilness produced by abusive parents\", \"the market wasn't just free enough\" etc. pp) and if once corrected will vanish all together. \n\nTheir line of argumentation is build upon the same tenets as every fringe ideology: \n\n1) the system inevitably will collapse due to it's inherent flaws or a revolution (soon).\n\n2) people just need to be educated and if they have to ability to properly understand it they will recongize the truth, if not then they are in denial, brain washed or are profiting from the current system \n\n3) The ideology I advocate is vastly superior and will improve everybody's life significantly. The only reasons it hasn't been implanted yet is due the ignorance of the masses and the malice of a small group of elitist (\"the capitalists\", \"the government\")\n\nAnarcho Capitalism has never existed in human history and it's blank page for all the hopes and dreams of people to draw their nice little utopia on it. Every answer of what would happen in situation xy can only be a product of phantasy, depending on the underlining perception the individual has of reality. \n\nThe only honest you can get to this topic is: nobody knows and it will depend on the situation. You can see a rich man buying military gear and just massacering everybody who stands in his way. Or reacting to the situation by improving the wages or subsidation for food. Or you can deny that something like poverty will even exist which leaves the question mood.    ",

That's a new low http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/west-point-center-cites-dangers-far-right-us/ &gt; Details about what makes an attack a “far right” action are not clear in the report,\n\nNaturally. &gt;It says anti-federalists “espouse strong convictions regarding the federal government, believing it to be corrupt and tyrannical, with a natural tendency to intrude on individuals’ civil and constitutional rights. Finally, they support civil activism, individual freedoms, and self government.\n\nCivil activism, individual freedoms, and self government... How radical!\n Nice try Homeland Security. do right-libertarians have any history of terrorist activity? If DHS was trying to entrapt anarchists, surely they'd go to the much more militant left-anarchists, no?  Justified, very. Foolish, absolutely.\n\nThe first step to getting free of government is to make sure they can't hurt you, or that you can hurt them enough that they won't bother. Attacking the government won't achieve that.\n\nThe NAP is just a principle upon which the law of a civilized society is based. It's not an automatic death sentence. Do you have any historic examples of government being abolished without violent insurrection?  Asking for an example of something in history as a prerequisite for its existence is fallacious. That's like having a conversation with Ben Franklin trying to argue that he can't invent a lightbulb in the future because it hasn't been done in the past. \n\nThat being said, every violent revolution in history to overthrow a government has resulted in another government.  Well, obviously, since there isn't any anarchism now. But there's been periods of time where violent insurrection has overthrown the government and people have lived in an anarchist society for years aftewards before another (often fascist) force invaded them and imposed government on them. Do you have any historic examples of government being abolished without violent insurrection?    You cannot fix violence with violence.  I actually disagree with this statement as a whole. Not that I'm advocating using violence against the state, but violence can stop violence. \n\nVery small scenario: Your brother is being beaten, to a point that you are fearing for his life. If you shoot the assailant the assailant would be less likely to kill your brother. It only postpones and redirrects violence.  I actually disagree with this statement as a whole.

It gets around that you don't break into my home. Viola, violence fixed with violence. \n\nIt's incorrect to throw out an Epithet and act like it s fact.\n\nThat's the point of owning means if self defense. It doesnt fix that situation, it ends it, but nothing there is fixed.  You cannot fix violence with violence.  Sure you can. Why do you believe that? Ive never seen it happen. Really? The US civil rights movement was violent as fuck. Slavery was ended in the US through violence. The Indian Indepedence movement was violent as fuck. The black panthers were ultraviolent. Stonewall was violent as fuck as was a turning point for gay rights. Violence stopped the nazis in WW2.          There are numerous **legal** ways to resist, protest, organize strikes, sabotage, unionize. It is not very difficult to **legally** crash the function of the state apparatus. Just be imaginative. Two of my heroes: Martin Luther King and Mohandas Gandhi. Not only did they affect revolutionary change by peaceful means, they changed people's hearts. It sounds cheesy but hey it's true. There are numerous **legal** ways to resist, protest, organize strikes, sabotage, unionize. It is not very difficult to **legally** crash the function of the state apparatus. Just be imaginative. If it's so easy to crash the state, then why is it still around? If it's so easy to crash the state, then why is it still around? If it's so easy to crash the state, then why is it still around? You mean, like Rome? Rome was crushed by invading Goths. Not through \"legal ways of resisting, protesting, organizing strikes, sabotage or unionization\". There are quite analysis that the collapse of Rome happened from the inside. The Goths were incidental.    It's justified to defend yourself or others and demand justice for previous offences. It is not justified to strike against a government without cause.\n\nAnyway, I think the complicity of those who merely support the government, or want it to do something, is tricky since obviously they are not the ones actually committing the crimes. Many in the general population would also be complicit then. I guess you have have to define what constitutes a conspiracy to commit a crime. The government has a vested interest in making you think that it's only acting on your behalf so you can't criticize it. They commit an offence against me every time I pay VAT; almost daily then.                 ",

    "snippet" : "  Seems fair. Clearly the fuel tax method is outdated.\nTime to start tolling roads so they can charge based on road usage?\nMight as well privatise them while we're at it. It depends on what you mean by \"road usage\". Miles driven is just as bad.\n\nIf we we're going to go for a metric, the greatest charges should undoubtedly go towards semi-trucks. Sure their fuel-mileage isn't the best but it's still far too good to make up for the damage they do to the roads - we're talking orders of magnitude difference between the damage a fully-loaded 80,000 lb semi w/payload does and a hybrid. \n\nNeither mileage nor fuel usage can account for that. The fact that they're going after hybrid drivers to pony up while effectively subsidizing these trucking firms AND increasing their weight limit even further (I believe they're discussing raising the limit to 97K lbs) is a joke to me. &gt;the greatest charges should undoubtedly go towards semi-trucks. \n\nWhat would lead you to believe it does not? Do you have any concept of what it costs in taxes to put a truck on the road? http://truecostblog.com/2009/06/02/the-hidden-trucking-industry-subsidy/ The road use taxes are just a small portion of the myriad of taxes, charges and fees paid by the trucking folks every year. The idea that cars cause around 1% of road damage is utterly preposterous. I'd be happy to look at your calculations. So far I've seen several different figures but all of them agree that the trucking industry doesn't pay nearly enough in use taxes. \n\nWhat other taxes they pay relative to what other auto owners pay isn't really relevant to this discussion because if we went to an ancap society with private roads a different formula would probably be applied - one that accounts for actual road damage. The fact that the trucking industry is even competitive at all over long distances with rail, which is far more efficient, suggests to me at least that there might be a subsidy that, whether direct or indirect, warrants more research.\n\nI am most definitely not a civil engineer, but the 4th power polynomial relationship sounds reasonable and the idea that a loaded semi causes as much damage to the road as 9600 cars was taken from the Highway Research Board, NAS, 1962. &gt;all of them agree that the trucking industry doesn't pay nearly enough in use taxes.\n\nIf they did, we would just pay more at the store for everything. Not a massive change. It would put the costs on people who buy the transported goods, while right now it just lays it on car drivers. On net, I suppose its more fair. &gt;all of them agree that the trucking industry doesn't pay nearly enough in use taxes.\n\nIf they did, we would just pay more at the store for everything.

The road use taxes are just a small portion of the myriad of taxes, charges and fees paid by the trucking folks every year. The idea that cars cause around 1% of road damage is utterly preposterous. This was a study done by several civil engineers who were more rigorous and suggested that the truck traffic accounted for 75% of highway damage:\n\n&gt;Percent of maintenance costs due to related truck traffic = 1.28/1.7 = 75%. \n\n&gt;Thus, the average annual maintenance cost per mile of each pavement segment needs to be adjusted by a factor of 75% to isolate damage solely attributed to truck traffic.\n\n(Page 55 and accompanying table showing 4 different road segments)\n\n[Link here](http://matc.unl.edu/assets/documents/finalreports/Bai_EstimatingHighwayPavementDamageCosts.pdf) That still seems high but at least it's not completely laughable like the 99% figure. I'll agree 99% seemed too high to me as well, but for an approximate figure produced by an amateur using fewer figures from 1962 it's not terribly far off. \n\nMostly what I got out of the posting was that the weight relationship is not linear and some sort of system that accounts only for fuel usage or miles driven would tend to be wildly inaccurate compared to the costs involved.\n\nA market-based approach would likely be more rigorous, and it seems likely we would rely less on trucking and far more on rail, reducing road deaths, road damage, and pollution. \n\nAlso the fact that the government is considering raising the weight limit significantly on trucks while these states are throwing $100 charges at Hybrid drivers, all of which are far below the average curb weight of the average vehicle? That's ridiculous to me. As a freedom oriented individual I would much rather have the 100 annual fee than a per mile charge. The concept of a government tracking device in my car makes me rage.  I like how it's perceived as some benevolent gift that the government taxes hybrids less.  ",
