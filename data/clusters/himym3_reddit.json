    "snippet" : "I wasn't so eagle eyed when I watched the episode, but I'm curious as to what everybody thinks of Robin not wearing her engagement ring. I know Robin &amp; Barney do get married, but there's no mention of divorce.\n\nI'm of the mindset that it's nothing to worry about, but perhaps I'm wrong. I'm just sick of the back-and-forth between Robin &amp; Ted. \n\nPROOF: http://i.imgur.com/NDoasID.jpg  In the future, she would be wearing the wedding ring, not the engagement ring.\n\nMost likely this is a production oversite. Is Lily wearing hers in the scene? I believe Lily was wearing her ring in the future. In the 2013 portion of the show you can still see Robin's engagement ring and it is clearly gone when she flashes her hand in the future. 'Flashes' being the operative term here. She is quite clearly supposed to be hiding her hand throughout, meaning that whether the ring is there or not when she accidentally flashes her hand isn't significant, but rather the fact they're hiding it in the first place to create suspense. (Much like they did with Barney in Trilogy Time last season.) That's what confuses me. Why would they make Cobie hide her hand? It was understandable when Neil did it in Trilogy Time (since we knew a lot less on Barney's marriage) but now they've confirmed several times Barney and Robin will get married. I guess they could be doing this because of the people who are not reading spoilers and who could still wonder if they'll go through with the wedding.\nI just hope they're not planning on separating them in the future.\n I assume it's because they want to play up the suspense with the whole \"Wedding day that went horribly wrong\" thing. It makes very little sense at this point, since not only have they confirmed it in interviews that Barney and Robin do get married, but there was also the flashforward of Robin dancing with her father at the wedding. But then, considering there still are people who think Robin may be the Mother, I'm sure there are those who expect the wedding to fall through, too. It's possible that the hiding would be to suggest that the marriage might not last, but I find that very unlikely, considering how much build-up there's been, and the way they've been presenting Barney and Robin as \"the One\" for each other in the past seasons.\n\n(And for the record, she is definitely [hiding her hand on purpose](http://barneyrobin.livejournal.com/980851.html).)  I definitely agree. I'm not questionning if it was done on purpose, since it clearly seemed so to me (even though more natural than the Trilogy Time scene, mainly because of the way Cobie's scene was shot), I just fail to see their reasons. You're probably right about the fact there's still people who want Robin to be the mother and hope there'd be some final twist. I don't know what could possibly cause them to continue encouraging this theory, now that we know so many things about the mother. Things like this scene and Marshall's \"not yet\" are just puzzling me.      ",

I just blame the writers for blemishing her like that. So lame. I like to think of season 8 Victoria as what happens when the \"one\" goes wrong. \n\nLike think about your SO right now.

This comment makes me happy. None of my friends that watch the show liked Victoria, but I mean come on they had the \"perfect night\". I also knew she would come back, but not in the way she did. I think I fell in love with Victoria before Ted did. I don't mean to sound pompous or anything. I just wanted it to be her even though I knew it couldn't be. I think she was the backup Mother just in case the series didn't continue to Season 2. Correct. Which always led me to believe that the Mother would never be Carly. She would be someone that was working at the wedding.   You forgot [this moment](http://sites.psu.edu/schneiderrclblog/files/2012/11/fat-barney.jpg).  Why the hell does nobody think this might happen again!? Because it wouldn't make sense story wise considering the whole character development they have gotten and their relationship build up for at least two seasons to be again squashed b/c of that. When i look at the quality of this seasons writing i'd say everything is possible.  Because it wouldn't make sense story wise considering the whole character development they have gotten and their relationship build up for at least two seasons to be again squashed b/c of that. It just seems like despite all that, the core bits of them that led to it are still there. The core being Barney's disinterest in relationships and Robin's fear of commitment? Those two are resolved. \n\nBarney has gotten his abandonment issues in control since knowing his father, and Robin is not afraid of commitment after she gave up the Chicago job for Don. Yeah, Don dumped her but the idea behind that relationship was that Robin could get over her fear of commitment. Why the hell does nobody think this might happen again!?

I could be wrong, but I'll believe it when I see it. Robin's left hand was hidden in every scene from the future in the last episode.  They seemed to make a clear effort not to show a ring or lack thereof. They did the same thing with the flash-forward where Barney, Ted, and Marshall are watching Star Wars.\n\nHonestly, though, as much as I don't think it fits for them to be together, I'd rather let their drama end so we can get back to Ted and the Mother. Seems like Ted has been a supporting character these last seasons, instead of the focus. I'm fine with it, I agree, but I just feel like the producers have some twist up their sleeve.  Maybe they're just future-proofing current episodes, but I feel like that saga may not yet be finished.\n\nI agree about Ted though, I just wish they would do something worthwhile with him.  Lately I'd rather watch Lily or the Barnacle than anything to do with Ted's miserable life. I doubt it. The series will end next season. That's not really enough time to meet a new characters for barney, robin and Ted and have it all wrap up neatly.  They don't all have to end up happy/together!\n\nThere are always hijinx they can play.  I'm still waiting to hear something about a surrogate for Robin or the ol' switcheroo where the voiceover says \"Aunt robin is actually ____....\"  Especially as the series gets deeper into the constant renewal cycle. True. But I would rather the show focus more on Ted now. Let barney and riven be happy. The show doesn't need to be bogged down by going over them again. And I would find it really hard for them to stay friends if things don't work again. I mean things almost didn't work out for them when they first broke up and then barney started being unhappy and blah blah blah. We don't need to see all that again. Besides in the episode \"band or dj?\" It showed the reception. Those usually happen after a marriage. Then something happed and Ted hurts his hand and all that but they do get married. Maybe future Ted will say that many years down the line maybe the divorce or some thing.  Maybe barney and Robin get to the alter and...\n\nPreist: Do you take Robin?\n\nBarney: NO!\n\nRobin: Thank God! I don't either! Still bros?\n\nBarney: Bros! Let's go party at the already paid for reception! Maybe barney and Robin get to the alter and...\n\nPreist: Do you take Robin?\n\nBarney: NO!\n\nRobin: Thank God! I don't either!

Should this not have a spoiler tag?\n\n\n\nEdit: My mistake   Just gonna say it...anyone who says they saw it coming years ago is full of shit.\n\nThey have plugged the whole Ted/Robin thing the entire run of the show. It is only in the 6th season that they started planting these little seeds about Robin and Barney, and even that was only in a couple episodes (Subway Wars and Challenge Accepted).  Did you skipped season 4 and 5 ,seeds were sowed in season 3 actually when they first time hooked up. Did you skipped season 4 and 5 ,seeds were sowed in season 3 actually when they first time hooked up.

It is only in the 6th season that they started planting these little seeds about Robin and Barney, and even that was only in a couple episodes (Subway Wars and Challenge Accepted).  You know what was a really big giveaway that Ted would not wind up with Robin? The fact that Ted refers to Robin as \"Aunt Robin\" at the end of the pilot episode. \n\nI was sure they would end up together for a brief period of time, but eventually they'd break up. I didn't realize the entire show would be about Ted getting over Robin and the series of event that led him to the mother though.\n\nBarney has been planting seeds with Robin since season 1. He treats needy, clingy, stupid woman like garbage. Robin is the first girl he really seemed to respect and romantically like. The rest was just an inference - if you've ever hung out in a decent sized group of guys and gals, usually 2 fall for one another. Given the group comp (Marshall + Lily, Ted + future mosby, and barney/robin) it's not too much of a stretch for us to have seen them getting together. Of course he called her that, doesn't mean the show hasn't plugged it the whole time. \"Aunt Robin\" meant that she'll be that one that dogs him for years (according to how the show has gone). People need to realize (a lot like Lost fans) that there was no overall plan. Even this season they have said they've been stretching for plot because they didn't know how long they'd be going. \n\nBarney and Robin were only planned together from about the 6th season (period in between 5 &amp; 6 perhaps). Its just how it is, if fans want to believe more they can but they're diluting themselves. The two guys behind the show have stated they always knew the major points of the story - who was going to end up together, etc. So the rough outline was there. They just didn't know how much time they would have to tell the story. And sacrifices would have to be made (i.e if the show had shit ratings, Victoria would be the mother from S1). Those are just backups just in case you get cancelled in between, you dont wan't to leave a story REALLY fucked up and undone.\n\nRemember some aspects of the show are loosely based on their lives. Although if I recall correctly, I think that would cover Ted/Marshal + Lily, rather than the whole gang. \n\nOne of the things the directors are big on is putting in clues/foreshadowing events. Now what they imply may or may not happen, but people tend to make predictions based on these clues. And when they come true, it's that \"a-ha!\" moment, and the assumptions turned out to be right. If it goes down like that, they saw it coming. Now of course they're always the people who shoot in the dark and are right by chance, but I feel there's enough circumstantial evidence and hints through S1-8 to justify getting a feeling earlier than S6 barney and robin would wind up together. \n\nA bunch of factors come into play when it comes to writing (pandering to fans, changing major plot points to appease them) but I like to believe the directors when they say they knew from EP1 Barney would wind up with Robin because it makes perfect sense. I agree with you that the timing of it was an unknown variable (how many seasons would they run for, etc) but the event itself was given from day 1. They just admitted in the TVFanatic interview this last November that they didn't decide Barney and Robin would wind up together till the end of season 5. Interviews are inconsistent, but fans want showrunners to be all-knowing. They aren't. Most shows are pitched without a full concept. This is one of them. Ahh what the hell? Did not know that! My apologies then - I read a bunch of interviews with the showrunners from the end of S7 onwards (curious as to when the show was actually ending since it felt like it was dragging on). During Q&amp;A they claimed they knew Robin/Barney from the start. That's the only reason I was harping that point.\n\nOh of course. No point in a fully completed concept - if your ratings are garbage S1, the rest of your story will remain untold lol\n\nDo you happen to still have the source link for that interview? I'd be interested in reading it.  Ahh so they finally emasculated Barney ? \n\nnot shocked. \n Lol character development is now emasculation? no, Character development is awesome. \n\nBut completely changing the character, and having him do a 180 Degree turn from being a philandering ladies man, to a married, well behaved one is at best, jarring. \n\n They were in their mid to late 20s when the first season started, and now it's been 8-9 years in the show. I think after that many years of empty one night stands and gradual ventures into failed relationships, it makes sense for Barney to grow up and evaluate what he really wants out of life. They coaxed it out of him as well - Nora was one the first that made him realize he wouldn't mind settling down (which scared the crap out of him).\n\nYou think anybody ever real wants to be that 80 year old man trying to pick up chicks at a bar? Barney has proved several times that his persona is somewhat a facade right from the beginning. S1 / 2 all he does is shit on the idea of marriage - then he flies out to SF to get Lily back with Marshall (after keeping chicks away from Marshall). \n\nHe's not really well behaved either, he realized what Robin means to him and he's not going to fuck it up being stupid. Half his antics and humor came from chasing women and lying to them. Clearly he can't do that now that he's getting married.\n\nIf he would have changed that drastically from say, S1 to S3, i'd be calling BS as well. But after 8 seasons, I'll chalk it up to character development. Not that it really matters but I think Barney was 30 or 31 in the first season. Totally agree though upvote for you. I always thought he met Ted when they were the same age - 23. The Star Wars trilogy episode was a pretty good indicator of how old they actually are in the series No they definitely aren't the same age. During the hurricane episode Barney says \"I'm older than you.\" Ted says \"yeah?\" \"And taller\" \"no just older\" \"and when you get to reach my age and height...\" And just after sandcastles in the sand Ted asked how I feels to be thirty. True. Wikipedia said that Barney (76) is two years older than Ted (78). First season was 2005 or 2006, which would make them both in their late 20s ",

I didn't think not enjoying the antics of a rapist was a particularly controversial or unpopular stance. Apparently /HIMYM has some serious Tyson fans. Guy's seriously changed since the 80's. Sure, it doesn't absolve him from his past misdeeds, but he more than deserves a second shot. I have to disagree. I don't think he has changed all that much. But there's two separate issues here. 1. the issue of deserving a second chance and 2. whether a figure like him belongs on a light-hearted sitcom.\n\n1. What exactly has he done to earn his second chance?\n\nHe beat his wife Robin Givens (most likely, given her allegations and his statements that he has hit women) in the late 80's, raped her, raped an 18 year old in 1991 - went to prison and got out in 1995,  bit a man's ear off, assaulted two motorists in 1998, cheated on his wife Monica Turner throughout their marriage, had various kids in and out of wedlock that he could not provide for, in 2006 and 2007 DUIs and felony drug charges, another fight, at an airport with a photographer, in 2009.\n\nSupposedly he has been sober for 2 years now and started the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation in October of 2012.

But that doesn't mean all avenues of employment are or should be open to them. And Tyson, he keeps acting badly, and doesn't really ever act goodly.

I may not like Katy Perry much as an actress, but she is not morally objectionable. And at least to that extent I can attempt to find her entertaining whereas with Tyson, I can't.

Yes, but he's changed. Humans can change.\nHas Chris brown changed? Nope but he can dance and sing.\nIs Chris brown a bad person? Yes and I hope he changes because it would be tragic to have Boby and Whitney part two.\nIn conclusion:\nSome humans make mistakes and can be considered immoral because of it. Heck, some of them like being that way. Some change and some don't but regardless, it shouldn't affect your opinion of their work. Should it be brought up? Of course! Yet, I believe a person's work is separate. Mike Tyson was a character on an episode of himym. He was acting. He did a good job of portraying his character. He made some horrible decisions in the past and I hope that stays in the past because he's a halfway decent actor. I understand why it upset you and its a shame you can't forgive him for being dumb and I bet he's sincerely sorry for it. I bet he's apologized. I bet he wishes he never did it. Besides, who of us is without mistakes? We all fuck up.\n\nTl;dr: judge a person and their work separate because we all make mistakes. Nobody is perfect. I think we fundamentally disagree on this one point. I don't believe that a person's art needs to, or necessarily should be, separated from who they are as a person.\n\nI don't go see Roman's Polanski's films for much the same reason. I don't like financially supporting rapists.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, this disagreement we are having is pretty much at the crux of why I think he should not have been on this show. His presence did not serve the story well, nor was it necessary in any way. It was off putting, upsetting, distracting, and, subjectively, not funny. I'm a male and I find this upsetting enough, but I'm sure that there are plenty of females who watch this show and were even more unhappy to see a man who has raped at least two women pop up on a Romantic Comedy show. \n\nMaybe on a show where his past misdeeds wouldn't be so out of place or off-putting, it would be OK. Like Law and Order SVU, where the fictional criminals are all worse than him.\n\nHis character on the show was him. His character in The Hangover was him. Mike Tyson. He is playing a version of himself, much the way James Vn Der Beek played JVDB on Apartment 23. It's image rehabilitation that I don't buy, nor do I want to buy by supporting a show that would enable him to do this. If he wants to rehabilitate his image, he should actually do something worthwhile with his life. \n\nI work in criminal law and I see people all the time who talk a big game, but really, they don't change. They are not sorry for what they have done. And given the chance, they'll continue to hurt people. And I often see them come back through the system after they have hurt people, again. But I have also seen people make the very real and difficult decision to change their lives for the better. He exhibits none of the traits associated with that. That I can tell. But, like you, I don't know the man personally. Maybe I'm wrong. \n\nBut it's about whether he is or isn't turning his life around. I hope he does. I just don't want to see his face on my tv watching an episode that is supposed to be light-hearted and fun.\n\nAnd Chris Brown - he's exactly what I am talking about - he has not changed at all. It's not hate that fills my heart, it's lack of pity for those who refuse to take responsibility for their actions and then take the necessary steps to get the help they need to never again commit those crimes.\n\nIf Chris Brown had been smart, he'd at least try to fake remorse and responsibility. But that's the problem with abusers, they don't have remorse for their actions, they don't accept responsibility for their actions. No matter how angry they get or how violent and inappropriate their outbursts are, there is always someone else at fault.\n\nI agree with you in pretty much all the details I do believe in second chances, I do believe that people make mistakes, I do believe that people have the power and capacity to change and we need to have a system set up that encourages and enables positive change. \n\nI have also seen men who most abjectly apologize, feel like shit for what they have done, swear to never do it again, and then fail to go to their AA meetings and their domestic violence classes and then they come back in a year or two later and their significant other is in the hospital on life support.\n\nYou talk about the past - I listed criminal conduct that was more or less continuous from the late 80's until a couple years ago. He's apologized? He feels bad? Who gives a fuck about his feelings. I care about the people he's hurt. \n\nAnd now I'm ranting. I'm sorry. That lowers the level of discourse. \n\nTLDR - You don't have to separate the man from his art, nor do I want to financially support a rapist doing image rehab, and ultimately I think it's in poor taste for this show to feature a rapist - rehabilitated or not. Guess you're not an NBA fan either\n\n guess not! Guess you're not an NBA fan either\n\n I think we fundamentally disagree on this one point. I don't believe that a person's art needs to, or necessarily should be, separated from who they are as a person.\n\nI don't go see Roman's Polanski's films for much the same reason.

I understand your particular distaste towards the act of financially supporting, in any direct or indirect way, someone who has commited violent crimes...\n\nbut your view on art is beyond arrogant and sanctimonious. It's people like you who SERIOUSLY put a stranglehold on art. You say that art can not be seperated from the artist, but that is if to say your moral system is a higher authority than the quality and value of the work of art or its value to society or those who appreciate it. It is simply illogical for you to believe that a work of art must be evaluated on the merits of its creator. \n\nEverything the film industry is now in terms of directing, cinematography, and editing is due to a man with known ties to the KKK. His very techniques are the very foundation of how the vast majority of film and television are structured. As a whole the film industry and community celebrate the work of a racist. \n\nContemporary horror and scifi owe a lot to HP Lovecraft, a man who was probably worse than a \"man of his times\" when it came to racism.\n\nLet's not even touch Thomas Edison...\n\nThe fact is that the merit of art will be passed down and the deeds and misdeeds of the creators will go mostly forgotten or turned into folk mythology. You can go back and play this game with any historical figure of importance, let alone mythological who man created and chose to worship. This has been how we've developed culturally and passed down tradition, information, and new ideas. \n\nYour PERSONAL ideals are noble, but it is just that. It is incredibly arrogant to believe it should dictate art.  Well, I never took quite so strong a stance as you state. You use CANNOT and MUST. I stated that I didn't think who a person is and what their art is need to or necessarily should be separated. You can accuse me of waffling, but I am aware of the point you are trying to make and trying to allow for it in my argument - that sometimes shitty people make things of great beauty - while at the same time trying to make my point that in this case.  \n\nI am curious as to exactly how people like put a serious stranglehold on art. If you could please elaborate on that point. Because I think it's a stretch to say that I am somehow inhibiting art because I choose not to go see The Pianist, or get annoyed when Mike Tyson pops up on a sitcom I like.\n\nI'm not quite sure what your issue is with me making a subjective judgment about what type of art I choose to support. Or how my view is arrogant? I am a consumer. The people making HIMYM are selling a product. I could base my decision to not like it on anything and still be valid as it is subjective. I don't think my ideals should dictate art. I think my dollars should dictate product - that's pretty much a universally agreed upon tenant of capitalism.  \n\nAnd in this case, I posit that Mike Tyson the rapist, playing Mike Tyson the lovable softie, is not entertaining, as I look at him and just see the bad. If you have no issue with that, then good for you. \n\n Well, I never took quite so strong a stance as you state. You use CANNOT and MUST.

Just saw the episode and came here to say this.\n\nDo I think Tyson can act in comedy, like *The Hangover*? Sure. But I'm still disappointed in the writers of HIMYM.\n\nOur two strong female characters, one incredible mother with a titanium backbone, and one gun-toting kick-ass Canadian, are big Tyson fans?\n\nI'm sorry - I don't see it. Seems to be in huge conflict with their characters. ",

For instance he seems to have an excellent job somewhere in the financial world so he's clearly not stupid. What are people's thoughts on this? Are there any other clues out there?

Then the businessmen who come to America love him because he not only speaks their language, but represents the perfect American stereotype of what you would expect a cool womanizer to be, plus he buys all sorts of cool things from Skymall.

Oh no, Chloe was also crazy. She fucked up the apartment \"looking for her keys\" that were right in front of her.  Oh right I forgot about that actually.

I would go a bit crazy too and fuck up the place. ......Yeah so crazy. Difference is, there is ted's current gf crazy, and crazy because someone just pulled a dick move on you. You only see her that way because its Marshall and the story is told in ted's perspective. \n\nIf it was based on her perspective, she would just have had a really nice date with a guy she liked and is about to get some action on in the living room. Than bam he goes out with his ex-gf and is gone for hours(I think?). She got mad, wrecked the place, just used a obvious dumb excuse, and left. not TOO out of norm for me.

I'm not sure any. From what I gather though, I think I'm the girl a guy dates and breaks up with 10 times before he meets the girl he really wants.   still think Barney was better with Quinn Why?

But instead of dragging the viewer through the mud with this girl can't we just move on? \n\nWhen Lily said that Ted needed this girl, I was in disbelief this is a total change of her character all together for the sake of dragging Jeanette on. I just thought it'd be nice for the last few episodes of the season if they explored other characters more. I just was curious as to whether I was the only person who felt this way.

By the end of the night (before they left), she was ready for it to go. And she did love ted. But then they get to that hearing and not only is she back on the gung-ho save the building tear, she's willing to destroy the career of the man she loves and his best friend for it? Please.

This is not only a physical journey of how he met the mother but an internal and emotional journey as well. It was said in the St. Patrick's day episode in season 3 that if he met her then she would of never liked him. This entire story is not only about how he got to the right place at the right time to meet her but how he became the person that he needed to be ready to meet her.

Janette is a major emotional step for him because this is the pretty much one of the final steps because after this he permanently wants to meet the one and settle down. Beforehand this there was always this feeling that being single is fun like he said in the latest episode but Janette is going to show him that it's no longer fun. It's not dragging their feet but building up to how crazy and life changing she will be to Ted. Once that happens then he is ready to meet her and will.

Kids would not be sitting there bored and complaining if he is telling them about their dead mother (\"Are we being punished\", \"You've been talking for like a year\", etc.)\n\n2. The whole point of starting with Robin was because it's the story of how he gets over Robin to become the person he is when he meets his wife. That's why they keep bringing the Robin arc back, because people don't get over someone in a matter of days, or even years. That's why the meeting of the mother is such a significant event for the show; the entire time he has been in love with Robin and it's not until right before he meets the mother that he gets over Robin. \n\nHe's not going to fucking marry Robin after all that. That would undermine the entire show's meaning. [deleted] Sorry for my colorful vocabulary but my point still stands.

I'm assuming they moved things around and updated the decor for a reason - I saw an interview once where the set director mentioned how everything is purposeful - but tracking those changes is hard. Right now I have a ton of screenshots but I'm not positive which coordinates with which episode. I'm working on it though! the changes in decor and whatnot are probably from episodes in season 1 and earl 2, past then, you wont find a change, simply because it is a million times easier for there not to be a change. \n\nif they are recycling footage, it becomes very hard for them to edit something in or out, its is just easier for them to leave it.\n\n\nthe main point of the show, is that we are viewing and listening to a very in depth version, and Ted is probably telling his kids about 2-3 minutes of info for every episode, aso the kids are getting a story all in one night, whilst we are getting it across 8 years. since this program is good with continuity, they wont be changing/editing anything in the room once they begin recycling footage, since people like you will begin to ask questions like where did it suddenly come from and stuff.\n\nseriously, once you get your information from the first two seasons, stop looking through the episodes.  I understand your point, but I'm saying that I've seen changes from season to season. For example, the scenes with the kids in season 6 are not exactly the same as the scenes from season 8. \n\nBackground items have already been confirmed as important - the little yellow bus, for example, and the piece of artwork seen in both Ted's future house and Stella's current house. \n\nThe changes could be completely random, with the set director moving and replacing things in between shots of the kids, and then dispersing them through the seasons, but there are absolutely changes past season 2. there could very well be a change from one scene in se6 and se8, but both of those scenes would have already appeared in season 1 and 2. no new footage of the kids has been filmed since season 2, and it is unlikely they have unseen footage (except for the mother reaction) or they wouldve already used it. im not saying there wont be changes, im saying that after season 2, you would have already seen any possible changes that werent edited in there could very well be a change from one scene in se6 and se8, but both of those scenes would have already appeared in season 1 and 2. no new footage of the kids has been filmed since season 2, and it is unlikely they have unseen footage (except for the mother reaction) or they wouldve already used it. im not saying there wont be changes, im saying that after season 2, you would have already seen any possible changes that werent edited in  The only time i recall seeing a change is from the pilot to the actual episodes.",

Then he goes through this whole thing with Quinn and they end the season by showing that he actually gets married to Robin (something I thought was inevitable after their episode together early on in the series).  \nI completely understand that the show is about how these relationships evolve, but having the entire season be about barney and Quinn and then to throw it out in the last minute feels like a waste. Like, a lot of that could be spent on Barney and Robin, or maybe some more info about the mother.  \nIdk, just my two cents, I guess. The pacing at the end of Barney's and Quinn's relationship was quite unfitting, though the relationship itself was quite important for Barney's character development. After he was ready to settle down he realized he needed someone he could trust in, which led him to Robin. Sure, you could have just put them together otherwise, but I liked it that way. would you rather them have introduced her after season 1? I'd rather they made fewer seasons with less filler. This.\n\nIf we look closely to the series, basically nothing changed between the 3rd/4th season and the 6th/7th, maybe only the baby of Lily and Marshall.\n\nThis is bad writing. It's a sitcom. If every episode revealed something important, the show would've been finished in season 2. Filler is pretty much inevitable. And I personally am enjoying the journey, even if it's long.

Wait, what huge breakthrough are you talking about?  Like when Barney Proposed the Robin Okay, I can see that. Although one could make the argument that it didn't really advance the plot because we knew that it was going to happen.  Or like when Barney met his dad Ohhhhh... I thought something big had been announced in yesterdays episode. Sort of. We know that there will be no girls (probably) between the crazy one and the mother. Like when Barney Proposed the Robin That was at the mid-season break. It makes sense to leave a cliffhanger there as much as at the end of the season.  Like when Barney Proposed the Robin   Like when we found out Barney was getting married? Or when we found out Robin was marrying Barney? Or when Ted proposed to Stella? Or when Ted became a professor? Or when Lily and Marshall decide to have a baby?  Like when we found out Barney was getting married? Or when we found out Robin was marrying Barney? Or when Ted proposed to Stella? Or when Ted became a professor? Or when Lily and Marshall decide to have a baby?  why *wouldn't* you leave a season on a high note? OP is just saying they don't save them all for finales.    I'm just happy we now know that this is the last girl before Ted meets their mother.\nI love the show, honestly I do, but holy shit an 8 year long story.    \nDo these kids ever shower? They're in the same clothes every episode! I've always assumed he's only been telling them the story for a few hours. He doesn't go to the nitty gritty but remembers them in his own mind.",
