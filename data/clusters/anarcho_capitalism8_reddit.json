So far it's up to 3 episodes in a series and I'm not sure if there will be more, but it, along with the rest of the episodes he has are worth listening to.\n\nThe Inevitability of the Police State:\n\n[Pt. 1](http://www.badquaker.com/archives/2238)\n\n[Pt. 2](http://www.badquaker.com/archives/2275)\n\n[Pt. 3](http://www.badquaker.com/archives/2287)  As both a Quaker and an anarchist, I probably should enjoy Ben's show, but I just don't, for the simple fact that he spends at least as much (and probably far more) time bashing libertarians who haven't quite made it to 100% anti-statism as he spends debunking actual, full-blown statists.\n\nI know I sound like a sellout to a lot of people when I say this, but I don't think it serves AnCaps to make the perfect the enemy of the good.  The cause of voluntaryism will inevitably win minarchists because of its ethical and moral correctness, so it doesn't really serve us to impede that process by being sanctimonious jerks in the meantime.

    "snippet" : "[This story](http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/06/justice/dc-family-research-council-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t3) on CNN states that the suspect is being charged with terrorism due to \"the intent to intimidate and coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the District of Columbia and the United States.\"\n\nCoercion is defined as \"force or the power to use force in gaining compliance, as by a government or police force.\"\n\nSo if A=B and B=C then Government = Terrorism   Apples are a fruit.\n\noranges are a fruit\n\ntherefore oranges are apples!\n\nYou have a valid point. Government can, and does, use terrorism as a tool. However you are using a logical fallacy\n\n\n\n\n Upvoted for keeping our community honest, however I think your example is flawed.\n\nBy the apples to oranges comparison:\nThe suspect (apples) is a terrorist (fruit).\nThe government (oranges) is a terrorist (fruit).\nTherefore the government (oranges) is the suspect (apples)!\n\nIn this case, /u/Gadsen is using the government's definition of terrorism, plugging in the definition of coercion, and using that to make the conclusion. This still wouldn't mean the government is admitting terrorism, because we would need the government definition of coercion. &gt;because we would need the government definition of coercion.\n\nHow would it be any different than the citizen's definition? Apples are a fruit.\n\noranges are a fruit\n\ntherefore oranges are apples!\n\nYou have a valid point. Government can, and does, use terrorism as a tool. However you are using a logical fallacy\n\n\n\n\n Apples are a fruit.\n\noranges are a fruit\n\ntherefore oranges are apples!\n\nYou have a valid point. Government can, and does, use terrorism as a tool. However you are using a logical fallacy\n\n\n\n\n The language the OP used was a bad way to illustrate the point he was making. Essentially, you're poking a hole in his failure to articulate his sound point.\n\nWhat's *really* going on here is that the state has decreed that *a* belongs to a set *T*. In this decree, it gave a list of **sufficient conditions** for membership in the set *T*. The OP then noticed that all states meet these criteria, therefore, by their own words, they also belong to the set *T*. This is absolutely valid and sound, as I will illustrate with fruits.\n\n* Apples are a fruit.\n\n* If something is made up the seeds of its parent surrounded by nutritious flesh, then it is a fruit.\n\n* Oranges are the seeds of the orange tree surrounded by nutritious flesh.\n\n* Therefore, oranges are fruits. Apples are a fruit.\n\noranges are a fruit\n\ntherefore oranges are apples!\n\nYou have a valid point. Government can, and does, use terrorism as a tool. However you are using a logical fallacy\n\n\n\n\n  It is even funnier when you use their own definitions against them. Definition of theft according to the law of England and Wales:\n\n\"A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it\"\n\nSounds a lot like what the government does to me.\n It is even funnier when you use their own definitions against them. Definition of theft according to the law of England and Wales:\n\n\"A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it\"\n\nSounds a lot like what the government does to me.\n If you want to use their own definition, that's not at all what taxes are.  In what way are they not dishonestly appropriating my property with the intention of permanently depriving me of it? First of all they are not \"dishonestly\" appropraiting your property. You are well aware of your obligation to pay taxes before you are in any position to ever pay them and so per definition hey can't be \"dishonest\".\n\n However, this is splitting hair. By \"their definition\" (the current used definition) taxes are definied as a levy you have the legal obligation to pay. Both theft and taxation are legal construction depending on the assumption of property rights a society holds. Given the current definition of propery rights taxation is someting completely different than theft. **Per definition**. One thing is legal the other isn't.\n\nTaxation only becomes theft if you change the underlining premise of property rights to a diffrent one that is at the moment accepted. A communist or \"normal\" anarchist would have a completely different definition of what he views as theft as he uses a different set of property rights as you do.   Why do I have to do it? Because the law says so.\n\nWhy do I have to do what the law says? Because the law says so.\n\nCircular reasoning. Of course it's circular reasoning but I wasn't the one who was claiming that \"by their definition\" taxation and theft are the same thing. It's not. Theft is theft and taxes are taxes. Per definition. It's really that easy.  If it is circular reasoning then I don't have a legal obligation. I can't be obligated to do something without a reason. If I am then I am being coerced and ergo the government is a terrorist organization. You are not obligated without a reason. The reason is the law. But if you insist on keep changing the meaning of words, than have fun with that?  &gt;The reason is the law.\n\nWhy am I obligated to follow the law? First of all they are not \"dishonestly\" appropraiting your property. You are well aware of your obligation to pay taxes before you are in any position to ever pay them and so per definition hey can't be \"dishonest\".\n\n However, this is splitting hair.

A communist or \"normal\" anarchist would have a completely different definition of what he views as theft as he uses a different set of property rights as you do.   How is taking my money and spending it on for example nuclear weapons not dishonest? &gt;Adjective\n\n&gt;    Behaving or prone to behave in an untrustworthy or fraudulent way.\n&gt;   Intended to mislead or cheat.\n\nThere is nothing \"dishonest\" about your obligation to pay taxes. You are free to look up for what your taxes are spend in the budget. And like I already said; this is **besides the point**. Taxes are taxes and theft is theft. Two legal constructs with different meanings. Of course if you want to change the underlining assumption of property rights willy-nilly you can define basically anything as theft but it still won't mean a thing. Oh right so as long as I tell you that I am going to take all your stuff it's okay? Oh right so as long as I tell you that I am going to take all your stuff it's okay? He's saying that as long as the government tells him that they're going to take all of his stuff it's okay. What difference does it make whether it is the government or not? In what way are they not dishonestly appropriating my property with the intention of permanently depriving me of it? \"A **person** is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it\" Government is made of people. \"A **person** is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it\" Oh, i get it. If you are in a gang you can't commit a crime, because a gang is not a person. \"A **person** is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it\"   The US government is the biggest gang in the world.

    "title" : "Work experience?",
    "snippet" : "  Hello everyone, I've been thinking about work experience a lot lately mostly because I can't find a full time job nor can many of my friends especially the ones who went to college. I took Jeffery Tucker's advice: if you can't find work volunteer. I did just that and worked video production at a church for 6 months last year and met nice people but I didn't notice any serious opportunities only to volunteer more and some primerica scheme maybe I just wasn't greasing my hands with the right people. I'm a little confused right now on what to focus on, I was thinking trying to join a start up or maybe volunteering again but I want money for a new car.\nI've avoided some jobs because I know the types of people that work there I'd probably be dragged down by the culture after a while(junkies), I'd like a job even if it wasn't the best paying to meet people wanting to do productive things and not just shuffle papers or looking for the next high, that's why I'm looking to join a start up. \n\nI hear a lot boomers mostly and figures in the market community talk about how work experience is always a positive thing especially when talking about min wage law(I don't support min wage laws). This seems really really strange, that skill is this linear thing and no matter the job you'll become a better person for that experience and that experience is easily transferable. Am I strawmaning? I really just don't hear people explaining it at all that's why I made this post!\n\n*My thoughts: Anyone whose ever tried to learn a skill or dealt with old farts knows that just doing stuff and having done something for a long time isn't going to make you good automatically it's simply a catalyst, in fact it can make you worse by developing bad habits. You have to have a critical mindset and try to focus on whats important with useful knowledge to back it up.*\n\n**If you know any good books about experience theory please post a link! Or just post what you've learned from working!** I want to find out if it's reality or just culture and a good way to profit off it if so. \n  1. Create a resume following the advice from Knock 'em Dead 2013: The Ultimate Job Search Guide.  Any recent year will suffice.  You can sit in Barnes and Nobles and take notes from the book there if you can't afford the book.  Absorb the lessons in that book.  It will give you an effective mindset.\n\n2. Go to maps.google.com and search for \"staffing service near [your address]\" and write down a list of all the places/addresses close to you.\n\n3. Go to one or two of those locations a day for one or two weeks.  You can do a walk-in interview with them during normal business hours.  Bring copies of your resume and dress nicely.  You will get business cards from them.  Call them back once a day or every other day.  They make money if they find you work.\n\n4. Combine this with anything interesting you see on craigslist.  It is helpful if you use a rss feed reader to keep track of the stream of incoming job opportunities.\n\nThose steps worked for me, and I suspect will work for anyone that seriously follows them.  Good luck.    Any RSS feed readers you recommend? I use a plugin for firefox right now called awesomebar but It's not the best but gets the job done.  Tell Jeffrey Tucker you want to volunteer for Laissez Faire Books. Do an excellent job, get hired and then make a career of advancing the cause of liberty.\n\nOr something like that.  Yeah Primerica scares/scared me. As for volunteering, I don't think that's a good idea as it makes employers think you aren't worth much. What I suggest is picking something in high demand. Idk what you're good at but I know video editing isn't an easy field to make it in, and they may prefer college grads. I'm doing computer science and the prospects look great. Lots of students get internships after their second year, and I have one for the summer. Good luck in your search. Can you explain why you believe volunteering is bad for negotiation leverage in the labor market? If you're working as unpaid intern then isn't that roughly the same but you develop a different skillset and networks?   My suggestion is to go on craigslist (yes) and respond to as many gigs ads as you possibly can. Sales jobs are notable for accepting people with high enthusiasm and relatively little experience.\n\nYour writing isn't bad, which is a good sign. Do you have any interests that might have commercial implications?\n\nBe aware that even terrible jobs can teach you a lot. Failure may be painful, but you can learn a lot from just trying, even if only in retrospect. Save your money, don't get into debt, and keep your costs as low as possible. Read about different industries to get a sense of what flares your interests.\n\nNonprofits are weird, and I don't recommend 'working' for them. I learned very little from internships. Even low wage jobs at for profit companies are more educational than volunteer 'work.' This is because the profit and loss accounting system help managers to coordinate their operations with the real demands of customers.\n\nVolunteer 'nonprofits' have no such accounting, and thus only serve the desires of the people who fund them. They may be oriented well around fundraising, but have no means of conducting economic calculation to serve their purported aims. Thank you for the taking notice of my writing, when I was a teenager I aspired to be a comic artist but once I went to college I really hated the art community and I realized I like money. \n\nI have pretty common skills I'd think: Drawing; writing; basic computer hardware and software like PH/excel. I was thinking of using some of the skills I learned to create a smuggler and hacker RPG for bitcoins in my spare time also for fun and the experience.\n\nHmmm craigslist. I've been awry of that place since my friend got mugged while dealing some *used* phones, he quit fencing after that! Cool guy he smoked with Adam from AvM and rents out houses out to frat kids while going to law school and wants to be an lawyer for liberty.\n\nMaybe I'll give /gigs a shot and just stay away from trade, I just put it on my feed. \n\nThat's a very interesting point about accounting when you volunteer you're not really on the clock and you can't really weed out the unproductive but then again in the profit sector there's a whole art to looking busy that plagues work culture.\nI feel like I learned from volunteering at the church, but I did feel like I wasn't being pushed the only real responsibilities I had was setting up/breaking down equipment and manning one of the cameras.\n\n\n  The economy absolutely sucks right now for young people.  So don't feel ashamed or like a loser if you can't find anything decent.\n\nI totally agree with you about the nature of \"work experience\".  I guess what they're looking for is proof that you're not a loafer or someone who doesn't have a work ethic.\n\nI think 90% of getting a job is your attitude and personality, and whether you have someone on the inside who could hire you.  It's all about who you know.  Network and let people know you need a job, don't be ashamed to ask or put your name out there - make up small business cards with your contact info. Yes it does, such is a highly politicized command economy. Then again where there is strife there's opportunities even if it comes with high risk.\n\nI read an article a few months ago that a vast majority of jobs are gotten inside, I wish I had the link.\n\n      Thanks everyone for the great replies, though I felt like I should have highlighted and reworded my main question:  \n*\"What is work experience? Is there a real theory to it? Or is it just 'you have to be this gray to enter'?\"*\n\nAs it seems it's more cultural then a reflection of reality especially when you see half of the advertised jobs saying \"need 10 year experience minimum\", but I certainly don't mind job advice from fellow ancaps and probably useful for a lot of other people as well.\n\nA lot of people my age hate older folk who are in positions of power, they see them as bigot bums who want to foot the tab for all their fuck ups on us and never want to compete with the young. They see us as junkie children rather then adults capable of leadership positions, it feels like a war is being waged against the young to keep them subservient children forever.\n\nEdit: For anyone who made a good post that wants a dota 2 beta key message me your steam name or email!

From what many escaped North Koreans have said, definitely the latter, with a mix of genuine misdirected crying at how fucked up their life is. How do we know that the escapees are not just self-selected to be the least psychologically deluded about their conditions? Maybe the reason everyone else hasn't escaped yet is because they don't believe they should.    I still just wanna know how the hell is the North Korea regime still being sustained even in conditions like this?

The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle?\n\nDafuq? What in the fuck does this have to do with anything? An \"ASS WEPONZ\" ban that would save less than 50 lives per year? We could mandate that all speed limits are set at 40 miles per hour or 65 km/h, and that would reduce traffic fatalities more significantly than an \"assault weapons\" ban (including speed regulators on cars that force that limit). Or, that's what we project would happen. \n\n&gt;\"Gun control is no longer debatable, it's not a conversation, its a moral mandate.\"\n\nHow about \"controlling\" the gov's guns? They do the most damage of any single institution, far and away. I'm positive that the damage the gov inflicts far exceeds private, legal gun owners. \n\n&gt;In the end, I hope that you will realize that the small arms I utilize should not be accessed with the ease that I obtained them. Who in there right mind needs a fucking silencer!!! who needs a freaking SBR AR15? \n\nUhhh... People who like their hearing? Seriously, guy. Let's say you're hunting, and you want to be at the peak performance. You can either hope that the game stays in position long enough for you to slip your muffs back on your ears or the plugs back in, or you could thread a suppressor and suffer only a minor amount of ringing and virtually nil hearing loss. Let's say that you're firing in your private field and would prefer not to disturb the birds in the distance. How many criminals use suppressors anyway? Fuck all. That's how many. \n\nI'm not opposed to leading corrupt shit eaters to the slaughter, but some of the shit he says is fucking stupid. Not the worst manifesto, but mediocre at best. 6/10 - step up your game next time. I know he'll never read this, but the next spree shooter who wants to send a message probably should. And have someone edit the manifesto for fuck's sake.   I don't approve of vigilantism, but punishing criminals (by libertarian standards) is acceptable. Just so long as the punishment is proportional to the initial criminal act. Only murderers deserve to be killed, for example.  &gt;A vigilante is an individual or group who undertakes law enforcement without legal authority.\n\nWho has legal authority to enforce the law in Ancapistan? I would argue that we all do, or no one does, making the term vigilante useless. I think we can readily differentiate between a reputable court or legal enterprise and the alternative. When it comes to case law, the courts can  be picky when determining whose precedents they look into. Just like we can readily identify doctors, it's not too hard to tell the difference between a professional/expert and a laymen. \n\nI do not believe it is wise to allow untrained, unrepresented persons practice law enforcement or peace keeping. I would also not want a unqualified person, with no company or other insurance backing, operate on me because he simply *thinks* he's qualified. \n\nI think it's prudent to differentiate between professional legal operations and vigilantism. I think one should get the okay from a legitimate court before attempting to enforce the laws, whether it's serving an arrest warrant or enacting punishment.  &gt;I do not believe it is wise to allow untrained, unrepresented persons practice law enforcement or peace keeping.\n\nHow are you going to stop them?\n\n&gt;I would also not want a unqualified person, with no company or other insurance backing, operate on me because he simply thinks he's qualified.\n\nWell that is fine for you, but what if another person doesn't mind being operated on by an unqualified person?\n\n&gt;I think one should get the okay from a legitimate court before attempting to enforce the laws\n\nAnd if they don't?

Holy fuck is that cheap ammo. holy shit. that is cheap. makes me think about getting an AK-74. my only concern is that 5.45 isn't as easily found as 5.56 or 7.62.  everything but the barrel and firing mechanism was printed, right? how long until they can print those, too? was the magazine printed, too? I believe the *only* parts that were printed were the lower receiver, the grip, and the stock. The rest seems to be off-the-shelf parts. I am not knowledgeable about guns. what are these? The lower receiver is [this part](http://bisonarmory.com/product_images/uploaded_images/br15-lower.jpg), and is the only regulated component of the gun. It *is* the gun for all legal purposes, and has a serial number engraved on the side for the purposes of tracking of individual guns. People are interested in printing this part since doing so enables one to avoid all federal regulation of firearms. The rest of the parts can be bought off the shelf with no licensing required.\n\nThe grip and stock are [these parts](http://www.mississippiautoarms.com/images/STK07160BLACK.jpg).\n\nWhen the gun is fired, most of the recoil stress is transferred to the buffer ring (seen protruding at top right of the lower receiver image), and in some designs this is the part that fails. The design in the video has an oversize stock which connects to the bottom of the grip, which apparently helps alleviate stress on the buffer ring and prevents failure. so, I could download a lower receiver, print it on my buddies 3d printer, buy all the rest of the parts at a store, put it together, and I have a gun without any wait times, regulation, etc? You can sort of do this already by purchasing an 80% lower and machine it yourself. If you do this you do not have to go through any checks and the lower will not have a serial number. The catch is that you are not allowed to sell or transfer the lower to anyone other than the person who made it. Here is a site that sells what I am describing. http://aresarmor.com/store/Category/hmgar15 You can sell it.  You just can't make it with the intention of selling it.  To sell it you need to pt a serial number and some info on it. What does it take to be able to legally say \"someone else built it?\"\n\nFor instance, if I have a 3D printer and my buddy wants a lower receiver, if he physically comes to my house and does nothing more than click the \"print\" button is he considered the builder and thus the owner?  Would it be legal to charge him for the service of \"renting\" the printer? What does it take to be able to legally say \"someone else built it?\"\n\nFor instance, if I have a 3D printer and my buddy wants a lower receiver, if he physically comes to my house and does nothing more than click the \"print\" button is he considered the builder and thus the owner?

Would it be legal to charge him for the service of \"renting\" the printer? Yes.  I've seen CNC machine use rental discussed and the legal eagles seemed to agree that rental and button pressing were both fine.  I don't think it would be any different with a 3D printer. so, I could download a lower receiver, print it on my buddies 3d printer, buy all the rest of the parts at a store, put it together, and I have a gun without any wait times, regulation, etc? That's my understanding, yes. I'm not certain about the individual legal ramifications though. It may still be technically illegal for you to do it.\n\nOf course, it's much harder to enforce such restrictions against individuals printing their own weapons than it is to enforce restrictions against a large corporate weapon manufacturer. The state only has to threaten a handful of people at the top of a corporation to prevent them from illegally distributing weapons to thousands of people. The number of people subjugated to number of people threatened ratio is much higher in the case of the corporation, on the order of hundreds or thousands. With printed weapons available to the individual, the ratio is more like 1.\n\nMy point is, you should check for yourself whether you can do this legally, but know that there's not a lot that could be done if you did it illegally. Legal to build your own gun.  It can't be meant for sale.  If you do end up selling it later, you need to put a serial number on it.  The engraving must be a certain depth and meet some other standards.\n\nAK flat receivers and AR 80% complete lowers are available for pretty cheap and don't require any wait period/background checks. What is a manufacturer's license for? A business.  Making your own gun for personal use isn't a business in the eyes of the gov.\n\nTo be clear, The ATF considers receivers that are 80% or less complete to be hunks of metal and nothing more.\n\nEDIT: Some details. What is a manufacturer's license for? I am not knowledgeable about guns. what are these? everything but the barrel and firing mechanism was printed, right? how long until they can print those, too? was the magazine printed, too? So you can't print the actual gun part? So you can't print the actual gun part?  I just heard [this story](http://www.wbur.org/npr/171154845/using-3-d-printers-to-make-gun-parts-raises-alarms) on NPR.  Here's the relevant bit:\n\n&gt;It would be easy to conceive the idea that 3-D printers are churning out cheap handguns, but there's a kink in the process. If you were to print an entire gun out of plastic, it wouldn't work. The bullet should shatter the plastic.\n\n&gt;You can print a gun in metal, but that kind of technology is not available to hobbyists now, and won't be anytime in the near future.\n\n&gt;\"The primary ways of doing this involve vacating a chamber and flooding it with gases,\" Griffin explains. \"And you have to keep the gases mixed at this really careful percentage or it explodes. It doesn't fizzle out and stop working — it actually explodes.\"\n\nAnyway, it's funny.  Either the 3d printing interests want to downplay how close 3d printing is to being able to completely disregard gun laws, or Eric Molinsky didn't research any of this very well. What do you mean he didn't research this well? I don't know of any guns with plastic firing chambers. The gun in the video I posted has standard metal parts in the upper receiver/chamber/barrel. I think he's right that the gun would shatter if one made an entire gun out of plastic today.\n\nHe may not be correct about how far off [DMLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering) is for hobbyists. I figure it can't be more than a decade before it's accessible to hobbyists, which I think totally qualifies as \"near future\" in the context of gun manufacturing/gun legislation. Even with SLS, can a gun barrel be created and reliable to the standards of the typical manufacturing process? Even with SLS, can a gun barrel be created and reliable to the standards of the typical manufacturing process?  How is this anarcho-capitalism? don't need gov't approval to own a rifle anymore How is this anarcho-capitalism? http://www.reddit.com/r/Agorism/    How exactly is 3D printing supposed to usher in stateless capitalism? it isn't, it does, however, make it basically impossible to enforce gun legislation against everybody. Gun regulations are already un-enforceable. Black markets *are* there. Gun regulations are already un-enforceable. Black markets *are* there.",

    "snippet" : "  \"price gouging\" is just newspeak for accurate pricing based on supply and demand. nobody is preventing consumers from purchasing water/food etc before a disaster at drastically reduced prices, purchasing insurance, etc. In fairness, it is also an allegation that could be made against heavily-regulated, government-privileged industries who use artificial monopoly power to drive prices up.\n\nI realize IP is a controversial topic, but one could imagine a scenario regarding expensive drugs, where someone could manufacture them cheaply and drive the price down, but for IP that protects the medicine patent which allows the original manufacturer to set any price he likes because he is protected by government from competition.\n\nI wonder, in comparison, what the price of firearms and firearm parts would be if there weren't so many government-mandated barriers to entry.  You'd still see supply-and-demand issues but I suspect these would be milder if you had, say, 10,000 people figuring out how to ramp up production rather than, say, 100, or however many there are in this country.   They are a bit too defensive on the price gouging aspect, though their sentiment is in the right place.  The older man, Barry, told a story about how he worked in a general store which raised its prices 1000% after a local snowstorm.  To me, there is nothing wrong with this, but he called this price gouging because people \"needed\" what they sold.  To differentiate from what they are doing themselves he went on to defend their own raising of gun prices as defending themselves from their competitors.  There is a lot to be said for being prepared for the situation.   I can't expect them to come right out and say it but price gouging is not a real thing in any objective sense.

I've read a lot of posts here and I love what I see.\n\nIn a discussion with one of my leftist friends, I actually was able to debate him on Intellectual Property laws (Patents, Copyright, etc), and was actually able to sway him to my position, opposing IP (or Intellectual Monopoly as I prefer to call it)\n\nInterestingly, I do not know why more people do not oppose IP. People despise monopolies and want freedom of information, so why do people so vehemently defend IP laws? Seems the corporatist influences in our government have once again spewed more lies.  Haha!

I then told him to look at the industries that thrive without copyright (Pharma and Computers/Software when they first started out), fashion, cars, tattoos, food, and others. I then nailed the argument with the fact that an idea is not property. An idea cannot be stolen. If I stole his car, that would be theft, because he would no longer have that car. If someone copies an idea, the person still has that idea, but all it means is that another person now has that idea and can compete. To me, I told him, IP laws are just corporatist and monopolistic in nature and breed economic fascism. \n\nEven some pro-IP people and lawyers on the side of big corporations have been on record saying that IP laws are not about protection, they are about monopoly. \n\nThomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin opposed IP laws, and for good reason.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.\n\n–Thomas Jefferson, letter to Isaac McPherson, 13 August 1813\nhttp://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html I just noticed I posted the same things you did. My apologies. Does that quote, however, sound like he is AGAINST IP laws? It seems that way to me. He seems to think they have both pros and cons.  Then again, he believed in the state... So... I believe the anti-Federalists (such as Jefferson) wanted to get as close to Anarchy as possible. Articles of Confederation anyone? lol  How similar was your argument to that used to oppose the idea of the public good? The argument for IP is essentially the same as the argument for government management of public goods, so if you can convince your friend to oppose IP, maybe you can dovetail that into convincing them to oppose all government management of public goods... which incidentally would lead to your friend being an anarchist!

Hell, I've been considering writing short essays on a lot of things. I should really start a blog.\n\nLong story short, both pro-IP and public goods arguments revolve around the idea that there will be free riders if the IP/public good is produced, therefore without either forcing everyone to pay (public goods) or forcefully preventing free riders from free riding (IP) the capital in question will not be invested.\n\nOf course, by the time free riding becomes an issue, the capital has already been invested and cannot be uninvested. Free riders do not prevent the non-free riders from paying for that investment. Positive externalities do not harm the producer; they just benefit others. &gt;I should really start a blog.\n\nYou would not have a lack of readers.

People can't barely comprehend the concepts of what's mine is mine and get your hand out of my pocket.\n2. People (including ancaps) have been beaten over the head with so much statism that it's hard to get a grip on something else. [Edit: we weren't born in this sub]\n3. IP is such a new concept that is even still evolving.\n\nI myself think the current IP system is a joke/corrupt/pointless, but as for a form of IP, I expect the market to give a form of respect to authors/developers in an ancap world. In this I don't be protection from copy infringement, but forms of dishonesty like re-authoring &amp; republishing. \n\nI'm not super-anti-IP like some in this sub, but in an ancap society it would be privately run organizations that would most likely uphold agreement to let you write your own sequels or prevent other writers from simply remarketing your stuff as their own. At the end of the day, you want people to read/enjoy your writings, use your software, live better from pharma-drugs, etc. &gt; in an ancap society it would be privately run organizations that would most likely uphold agreement to let you write your own sequels or prevent other writers from simply remarketing your stuff as their own.\n\nThe situation you have named is not an intellectual property issue, but rather a fraud issue. yeah... i was kind of experiencing an IP epiphany as i wrote this... go figure  &gt; Interestingly, I do not know why more people do not oppose IP. People despise monopolies and want freedom of information, so why do people so vehemently defend IP laws?\n\nBecause they think they need it to be fairly rewarded for their creative work.\n\nI'm a software developer, and I don't believe in IP.  I develop highly specialised applications, for specific, individual clients.  It suits their very particular needs.  No one is going to \"pirate\" it.\n\nTo analogize a musician, it's like getting paid to write a new song every time for someone specific, rather than writing something generic in x work hours, and expecting to get paid for it by anyone who listens to it until the end of time. Companies have R&amp;D departments that develop company-specific technologies. There generally are not R&amp;D companies who develop generalized technologies for other companies.\n\nSound economic organizations internalize the costs of non-excludable goods, and produce excludable products for market consumption. &gt; There generally are not R&amp;D companies who develop generalized technologies for other companies.\n\nBut there are research universities attended by students and faculty who have to publish their work for all to see in order to get the academic credentials they are trying to get.\n\nFor example, we're implementing digital facial recognition for an automated staff clock-in system at an airport freight depot.  I have to do the specific implementation of this technology for that purpose, but the facial detection and recognition algorithms the computer needs to do on a live camera feed were developed by some bright spark at MIT decades ago, and he got his PhD with distinction in exchange for that work.  And MIT benefits by having its reputation as America's brain bolstered by the work.\n\nIt doesn't have to be so institutionalised as a university in this day and age, I don't think, but the essential point is that an individual can benefit from doing generalised research for anyone who wants to use it - it tells everyone:  this bloke... he knows what's what.  How much is having a doctorate from MIT worth, in cash terms? That's a good point, though I hesitate to bring it up considering how much stolen money is being funneled into the university research system by the state. The alphabet agencies need their toys, but in fairness, there is a lot of good you can do with things like unmanned aerial vehicles, if your priorities aren't that of a paranoid psychotic. I certainly agree that the products of government coercion can be usefully turned against the state, or utilized for personal benefit. I just don't think the existence of such products are useful to mention in an argument for a free society, since the manner in which they were produced would no longer exist. Where there is a will, there is a way.  It's not like it's the government producing the wealth, is it? Companies have R&amp;D departments that develop company-specific technologies. There generally are not R&amp;D companies who develop generalized technologies for other companies.\n\nSound economic organizations internalize the costs of non-excludable goods, and produce excludable products for market consumption. &gt; Interestingly, I do not know why more people do not oppose IP.

IP laws can be a tricky subject. It is hard to imagine aspects of a world we have never lived in. Many consider IP to be moral. Many consider IP rights to be a condition of existence. IP rights where the last thing that kept me from becoming An-Cap. I have concluded that you can still have IP rights so long as you can keep your Ideas secret.   If you have achieved great victory in debate, does this mean you're a...master debater?  Convincing leftists to abandon IP is easy; especially if they're not huge fans of any kind of property anyway.\n\n&gt; *\" why do people so vehemently defend IP laws?\"*\n\nExact same reasons I defend other kinds of property.  Why do you defend property? The question is however, are ideas property? I say no. It is not tangible.  So, if I were to overhear you having an amazing idea at work... and rush to tell the boss first (and then receive compensation for the company's gains), you would have no problem with that because I didn't \"steal\" anything from you? If you write a book, did you invent paper? Did you invent the ink? Did you invent the pen? Did you invent the language, words, or syntax of the English language? Edit: Shouldn't the guy who invented these things be compensated for you making money off of writing a book? (Exclude the fact that these people are dead).\n\nAs for stealing, what is theft? If you do not physically take something away from me, is it theft?\n\n\"You want your invention to yourself? Then keep it to yourself.\" -Benjamin Tucker\n\nhttp://mises.org/daily/4575 If you write a book, did you invent paper? Did you invent the ink? Did you invent the pen?

Also think about how high the piracy market is even when music and other industries have extremely strict IP laws. Did you see the EU ruling that conviction for file sharing is against human rights?  Look in r/technology That's absolutely saddening. Against human rights? How about the drug war, \"victim-less crimes\", military interventionism that is not defense, the police state, things like that. A voluntary interaction against human rights? Oh boy, they're in trouble aren't they. Stefan Molyneux (on youtube and podcast) just did a 30 minute piece showing that Europe is dying. The question is however, are ideas property? I say no. It is not tangible.  You didn't answer my question, you're just skipping ahead and presuming things.  Until one answers the question of [1] property, it is pointless to address the question of [2] intangible property.\n Have I not answered that? A house is property. Your wages are property. Your business is property. It's a physical object that can be seen and touched. Can you see or touch an idea? If I use that idea to build a product, that is a physical asset that can be touched or seen. That is my point. \n\nAlso, I feel that understanding the definition of theft clears up, in my mind, many areas of this issue. &gt; *\"Have I not answered that?\"*\n\nThe question was: *\"Why do you defend property?\"* which you haven't answered yet.\n\n&gt; *\"A house is property. Your wages are property. Your business is property\"*\n\nThat's merely a list of items you wish to be property.  The question is **\"why\"** or more specifically **\"why do you defend\"** *(promote, enforce, advocate ,etc)* I see. My apologies if I have not adequately answered your question. \n\nI defend property because if you gain possession of something through voluntary interaction, you have the right to keep the fruits of your labor. Since your labor is an extension of you, you have a natural right to your life, liberty, and property. You use an extension of yourself to produce goods/services and are paid wages for them, then use those wages to acquire needs/desires. That is why I defend property.  The question is however, are ideas property? I say no. It is not tangible.  OK, so do you apply this to all \"ideas\" or do you have a double standard? Yes, I do apply this consistently. Having a double-standard on certain types of \"ideas\" would completely invalidate my position. OK, the example I like to use is reputation and credit identity. Surely you would agree that the concept of reputation is intangible and therefore is not for any one persons exclusive use (i.e. property). If i want to buy something off of someone and they ask who I am, can I tell them FluffasaurusRex? After all, we can both share that name and reputation and neither of us would be short of anything tangible. There would be, assuming, a private-sector way of proving identity. If we were to buy things with credit identity, there would be numbers and specific things to distinguish people. Such as credit card numbers or other ID.\n\nAs for reputation, I could type out the whole reasoning, but I'll let the great Murray Rothbard talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuow3f_eZZM &gt; a private-sector way of proving identity.\n\nDoes that mean if there becomes a private sector way to identify music, movies or software, then they become legitimate property like everything else?\n\n Well consider the tight regulation of some industries today in regards to IP. Even in the tightest markets, there are high levels of piracy and such. There may be attempts to adapt private IP laws, but as we know from voluntary interaction, these laws will not be very effective. Private property rights will, and have, worked incredibly well, in a voluntary society. However, IP laws have not. Since this is the case, is there such a thing as \"Intellectual Property?\"  Well consider the tight government regulation today in regards to identity. Even in the tightest markets, there are high levels of identity theft and fake IDs. There may be attempts to adapt private identity laws, but as we know from voluntary interaction, these laws will not be very effective. Private property rights will, and have, worked incredibly well, in a voluntary society. However, identity laws have not. Since this is the case, is there such a thing as \"my identity?\" \n\ncan you see the double standard yet? ",

    "snippet" : "  Then the government comes in and ruins it with subsidies. and they tell Al that he needs a license to operate a farm. and force him to use this fertilizer and that pesticide.   This gave me the heebie-jeebies, how he kept talking about how the farmers didn't *need* to know more, they should rely completely on the price. He didn't mention anything about how prices can be artificially changed. A lot of production around the world is manufacturing, where wages and selling price are both chosen by the company.  How is that different from farming?\n\nPrices aren't determined by manufacturers any more or less than farmers.  Market supply/demand is market supply/demand. It's not nearly that simple. Markets are made up of people, after all. Some companies chose to manufacture goods in the united states and sell them at a higher price because they have to pay higher wages. Some companies chose to manufacture in third world countries where they can pay peanuts and lower the price of their production. Sometimes a company will have a patent where they are the only producer so they can create scarcity and charge more, or create a brand that uses psychology to inflate the perceived value of their product. Corn is mostly just corn. This gave me the heebie-jeebies, how he kept talking about how the farmers didn't *need* to know more, they should rely completely on the price. He didn't mention anything about how prices can be artificially changed. A lot of production around the world is manufacturing, where wages and selling price are both chosen by the company.  You are correct but not for the reason you mention. Prices are the most efficient way of aggregating basic information and allows you to take quick decission without the need of losing valuable time investigating every event in the world.\n\nBut some people, not most just a few, might have the need to spend time researching the actual causes of the changes in prices in some specific sector to have a better picture and make better decissions.\n\nThe price system is the main transmiter of information, and very efficient at that, but not the only one. Agreed. There are some basic systems in place where people have tried to transmit other important information (consumer reports, journalistic exposes of inhumane worker conditions, \"green certified\", that kind of thing) but I'd would argue that we need to do more and stop acting like price will magically tell all. It doesn't. \n\nThe only situation where price will be a perfect indicator of value/demand is when everyone involved in the market has perfect information, which rarely happens for so many reasons. Perfect information does not rarely happen. It never happens.\n\nThe point of the price system is to economize our time and energy. When you are deciding between buying an apple or a pear you dont need to know/study all the exact reasons why this season the pear has gone up 20 cents and the apple has gone down 40 cents. Whether is a war that has disrupted trading routes, new plantation methods for apples,... whatever, the information gets aggregated in the price and allows you to make a quick decission, so you can spend your time and energy in things you are good at or you enjoy doing. Imagine if we had to make an study on everything we bought. Its not possible. The price system is very efficient allowing us to take quick decissions.\n\nBut the price is simply that, a very efficient aggregator that allows us to take quick decissions and allows us to have a life. Behind the price there is a world of stuff, but its not for everybody, in fact its only for a few in each sector. Its impossible for a human being to know everything about every sector. The price system overcomes this human limitation.\n\nTo me it is so wrong to paint the price system as the only information you will ever need to know, as it is to paint it as this devil and abusive system when it is what allows efficient trade, which is the base of civilization and one of the keystones that has given us our standard of living.

There's nothing that might influence how they come to those decisions?  Disingenuous to say the least.  Prices are suppose the be the ultimate communicator of total inputs; including wages and materials.  These inputs, or rather their prices, were subject to supply and demand.  Price alone does not communicate anything at all about futures (or any other costs or benefits not transmitted through price).

The farmer doesn't need to know.  The point is that the information requirements exists regardless whether it's farmers doing so themselves or looking to speculators.  This video makes it out as though price is all that matters in an attempt to convince people who don't know any better. Yes but the speculators took on all the risk while the farmer locked in his price. The speculators might be wrong but the farmer knew everything he needed to.

Is that what you are saying?   \n  \nplease english better you sense not make of it A farmer's yields are very much a matter of their investments.  The only condition under which they will sell their surpluses regardless, let alone at a certain price, is with a futures contract.\n\nSurliness aside...  Buyers and sellers willingness is a matter of utilization.  While this is related to inventory, as in I need food and have money or vice-versa, price conveys no substantial information on physical stores.  Adjusting production when prices are high or low is effectively a guess; however well informed. A farmer's yields are very much a matter of their investments.

Adjusting production when prices are high or low is effectively a guess; however well informed. You have not made any case that prices are meaningless for production. Prices will always translate through to the producer even if the supplier is between the producer and consumer. Most produce is perishable so the turnaround is much faster than you think. This means that price is more than just an approximation. Its real, and if you think this video does not convey a correct picture of how prices operate, you are simply being obtuse.

It is not exhaustive, so pose your arguments in a exploratory manor and you might sound like less of a jackass. The futures market is a layer on top of the actual market; it's Vegas. The futures market are for people to gamble on the knowledge they think gives them a leg up for the FUTURE. Kinda like the crystal ball. The more clear your \"ball\" is the better you will do. Some win, some lose. In the end the price evens out to where it will be because the losers pay.  Its not like a crystal ball. At least it performes better.\n\nThere have been many studys of prediction markets and the perform actually very well. This has been shown again and again. Future markets are knowlage generators, crystal balls are not. I thought they always end up as a random walk?

    "snippet" : "So basically, if a person wants to dump toxic chemicals into a river, if it's far cheaper than disposing of them properly and as long as the people downstream don't connect the dots...  yes, obviously if people are terribly sick suddenly they'll hire someone to figure it out for them, but what if the cancer rate just increases by 20%?  What if the toxic dumping is intermittent and the water shows up clean when tested?  Without actual inspection and questions of production, byproducts, and disposal, and a requirement to demonstrate safe disposal, what can be done?  Factory owner naturally says it's his property, he was there first (just supposing) and you son't have to live anywhere near him or downriver if you don't want to.\n\nWhat protects any species from being hunted to extinction?  What keeps national forests from being harvested for wood?  Mountains being blown into flat-topped rubble?  What keeps the air from being turned into a thick haze of \"it's probably not harmful\"?  Nuclear waste transport and storage?  \n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting other concerns here, as well, but that's a solid bit of worry.\n\n  &gt;yes, obviously if people are terribly sick suddenly they'll hire someone to figure it out for them, but what if the cancer rate just increases by 20%? What if the toxic dumping is intermittent and the water shows up clean when tested?\n\nHow does a state solve this? If it is impossible to prove the source of pollution, then no system will solve it because no one knows what needs to change or how to solve it! Sure, a state can simply pass a bunch of laws, and yeah, they'll probably stop some pollution here and there, but how can you have any measure of whether or not the decrease in production is worth it? There's not a proper price system so that simply cannot be determined. Sure, you can hope they get it right, but this is government we're talking about after all, how often do they get things right? lol You have no idea whether they're reducing production so much that they're doing more harm than they are good.\n\n&gt;Without actual inspection and questions of production, byproducts, and disposal, and a requirement to demonstrate safe disposal, what can be done?\n\nI think it's a very large and unrealistic assumption that there would not be inspections. Imagine you're an insurance company, and the owner of a production plant comes to you to purchase an insurance plan. Are you going to give him insurance without at least inspecting the plant to make sure it's not a huge risk? Of course not! You're going to make regular and thorough inspections to ensure that your risk is as low as possible. There could also be various watchdog groups who run their own inspections as well, score the company and pass that information onto consumers. Inspections simply do not require a state.\n\n&gt;What protects any species from being hunted to extinction? What keeps national forests from being harvested for wood? Mountains being blown into flat-topped rubble? What keeps the air from being turned into a thick haze of \"it's probably not harmful\"? Nuclear waste transport and storage?\n\nNone of this is ensured in a statist system :-) There is always the question of 'what if the state decides it no longer wants to protect the forests?' etc. (just look at China for examples of mass environmental damage caused by a state. 3 gorges dam anyone? Displacing 1.3 million people and destroying countless cultural and historical sites...only a state could do that!) Now in our society this would be pretty out of the question, but why is that the case? That is the case because huge numbers of people support environmental preservation at least to some extent. It would be political suicide to go against that. In a polycentric law society, the 'law' (I saw 'law' because it's not law in the sense that we know it but there would still be societal norms that serve much the same purpose) makers would have similar policies, and support organizations that promote environmental protection, etc. Ownership of national parks for example could be handed to a scientific/environmental protection agency that was non-profit and dedicated to preservation. In the case that the land is simply more valuable for its resources than its natural beauty, who are you to say that that's wrong? Obviously society needs some resources, no? There must be a mechanism for deciding what get preserved and what doesn't. There is simply no better system for deciding this than the price system. &gt; How does a state solve this?\n\nOstensibly, with concern only for public health, without regard for expense, with mandatory oversight.  Surely you realize that there are SOME things a government can better achieve.  Pulling out idealistic anarchy will only result in me pulling out ideal government.  I highly doubt we would have roadways as vast as the interstate, I highly doubt we would have a body for the controlled dismantling and monitoring of nuclear weapons (which aren't going anywhere), and I highly doubt environmental conservation could be as effectively executed.  You just can't compete with an authority that tests at random, that doesn't have to break even when bidding for insurance companies over the value of the service.  You can't be refused, and if you are beholden to symbols like The People you're probably less likely to take a bribe to look the other way, which is compounded by a structure that alternates inspectors instead of the most economical route of hiring one person to do the job.  Mind you, I'm not crediting the government with having a rotation system in effect, they probably don't, but they could without so much respect for cost.\n\n&gt; None of this is ensured in a statist system :-) There is always the question of 'what if the state decides it no longer wants to protect the forests?' \n\nIf we're pushing the idea that nothing is guaranteed, then there is no guarantee that an anarchy doesn't spontaneously reconstruct a government.  I put it on about the same likelihood that the government totally forsakes the environment tomorrow.  This line of argumentation does not assuage my concerns at all.\n\nIn polycentric law, as long as the effects make it into the next town, the tribalistic \"fuck you\" applies.  No one can claim to own a river, only the portions of it they reshape, so if one town starts dumping waste upstream, to their economic and community benefit, others down stream likely cannot do anything about it short of armed conflict.  Albeit my understanding here's poor, but without widespread rule of law, it's going to be hard to guaranteethe environmental stability or even your ability to get home after a trip, or even access to emergency medical care.\n\n Back to the topic, I'm relieved to see that there are some reasons , some justification for desire for Environmental Protection in an anarchy , but I'm still convinced you can file this under something the government just does better.      I think most of your questions have been answered but I think I can offer some more answers to two of your questions:\n\n&gt;What protects any species from being hunted to extinction? What keeps national forests from being harvested for wood?\n\nPrivate ownership incentivizes the preservation of the long-term capital value of the property. When things are publicly owned or not owned at all, a [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) results as resources are quickly depleted.\n\nThe seminal example regarding prevention of species extinction involves a comparison between the cow and the buffalo on the American frontier. Property rights were applied to cows and they thrived whereas no property titles existed in the buffalo and they were nearly hunted to death. (I hate to confuse the issue but there is some research showing this may not be the best example. See [here](http://www.montana.edu/econ/seminar/Archive/pjhillwhenistratgedy03302012.pdf).).\n\nRegarding leveling forests, logging companies often find it more profitable to invest in replanting trees. In fact, as more trees are cut down, the *more* profitable it becomes to plant more trees.\n\nOtherwise, the price system helps to determine what is the best use for forests and strictly defined property rights internalize negative externalities. &gt;The seminal example regarding prevention of species extinction involves a comparison between the cow and the buffalo on the American frontier. Property rights were applied to cows and they thrived whereas no property titles existed in the buffalo and they were nearly hunted to death. (I hate to confuse the issue but there is some research showing this may not be the best example. See here.).\n\nThe ability to domesticate cows also plays a role here.  Cow herds can intermingle without territorial issues, allowing ranchers to mix herds.  If I recall correctly, in 'Guns, Germs, and Steel', Jared Diamond talks about how american buffalo have a tendency to panic and don't work well in larger herds because they're more aggressive to neighboring herds.  \n\nWhich plays into the property rights argument.... if an animal is difficult to domesticate, it's difficult to own.

Larken Rose is great on this.\n\nI also don't know if I would commit to these entities as having carved out physical geographies necessarily.\n\nWhat I was saying is that anarchism is a lack of active advocacy for the legitimacy of any one person to rule, but it need not commit that same person to go along with or against a set of structural arrangements if they perceive it the best of their options.

It is crony-capitalism at best. Government and corporations working together. That is not a free market.\n\nAll their arguments boil down to \"do it our way, you have to, otherwise we will destroy your property and make you conform.\" \n\n  It's best to understand them as 1) reactionary anti-authoritarians (that's not necessarily a slight) or 2) communists or socialists who want \"the people\" directly in charge of the state or to compose it. The giveaway is how meticulously they *plan* society post-state, as opposed to *predicting* it as we do (at least more so). &gt;The giveaway is how meticulously they plan society post-state, as opposed to predicting it as we do (at least more so).\n\nThat's a great distinction to focus on, between the two's analytic methodologies.\n\nI just look at left-anarchists as nothing more than cultural marxists, that is to say egalitarian authoritarians in more than just the economic sense, but in every other possible diversity.  Absolute mad men, they are.  (Oops, I said, \"men\"; how oppressive of me!)  That's a pretty incoherent rant.\n\nAny system supporting ownership of territory is not anarchy. It is the distillate of the state. The difference between the existing system and anarcho-capitalism is that one features 200 states, one features 2 billion.

Bingo, this conflation between property and the state is a very monarchist idea. It's not conflation as an error in thinking, I'm not confusing the two, I'm saying that one is essentially a form of the other. I consider myself an advocate of property, but I recognize some forms of property as invalid, including intellectual property and territorial property. I don't want to destroy property, just its illegitimate forms. All right, but it's one thing to saying that \"territorial ownership\" is illegitimate because you disagree as to how that ownership is procured or the rules surrounding it (how you appropriate from nature, how long you can own something etc). It's another thing to say that \"territorial ownership\" is illegitimate because it's not ownership AT ALL, i.e. that it's just another name for a state.\n\nTerritorial \"ownership\" is obviously just a turf, an arbitrary territory claimed by one gang in relation to all the other gangs. It has nothing to do with actual ownership of physical material. It's just a metaphor, or phrasing made to make it sound more justified. \"Our land\" does not mean literally our land, but rather \"our area that we claim as our home\" or whatever. &gt; ...it's one thing to saying that \"territorial ownership\" is illegitimate because you disagree as to how that ownership is procured...It's another thing to say that \"territorial ownership\" is illegitimate because it's not ownership AT ALL...\n\nMy position is that ownership of territory is categorically impossible because ownership of territory is impossible to procure. Therefore, claims of such ownership are inherently unjust. States necessarily make such claims and consequently are inherently unjust.\n\n&gt; Territorial \"ownership\" is obviously just a turf, an arbitrary territory claimed by one gang in relation to all the other gangs.\n\nSubstitute \"gang\" for \"party\" so that it is sufficiently numerically ambiguous (numbers not being relevant here) and we reveal that \"Territorial 'ownership' is...just...a...territory claimed by one party in relation to all other parties\". This is consistent with ownership of land. &gt; States necessarily make such claims and consequently are inherently unjust.\n\nThis is the only distinction; does the state make other claims than \"owning\" the territory? Does successfully defending a territorial claim make me a state? If the answer is yes and no, then that's the only point being made here.\n\n&gt; Substitute \"gang\" for \"party\" so that it is sufficiently numerically ambiguous (numbers not being relevant here) and we reveal that \"Territorial 'ownership' is...just...a...territory claimed by one party in relation to all other parties\". This is consistent with ownership of land.\n\nI just meant by \"territory\" here is a sovereign area. You go there at your own risk. &gt; does the state make other claims than \"owning\" the territory?\n\nNot necessarily, no, there aren't any other claims that need to be made which are essential to something being a state.\n\n&gt; Does successfully defending a territorial claim make me a state?\n\nMaking the claim is essential to being a state, but defending it successful is not. It just makes you a state occupied by foreign invaders.\n\n&gt; I just meant by \"territory\" here is a sovereign area. You go there at your own risk.\n\n\"Sovereign\" is not an adjective that applies to territory in the anti-state lexicon. People can be sovereign. Countries can be independent. States can be created. Territories can be controlled. These are possible combinations. Territories are not people and cannot act as if they were people, thus cannot be sovereign.\n\nAnd everything you do is at your own risk, if you wanted to state the implications of going there more clearly I'll entertain the idea again and respond. &gt; Not necessarily, no, there aren't any other claims that need to be made which are essential to something being a state.\n\nI'm not going to get sucked into another debate on this with you. You have already conceded a conceptual difference between a state and a \"territorial owner\". You said earlier:\n\n&gt; ownership of territory is categorically impossible because ownership of territory is impossible to procure. Therefore, claims of such ownership are inherently unjust.\n\n1) Define ownership of territory and 2) explain what you mean by \"impossible to procure\" and why it makes it \"unjust\". \n\n&gt; Territories can be controlled. \n\nThis is what I meant. &gt;The difference between the existing system and anarcho-capitalism is that one features 200 states, one features 2 billion.\n\nThere is a difference between a landlord and the state.\n \n[The state is the monopoly provider of law in it's territory.

Are you saying that it is right for them to violate contracts in situations absent aggression other than violation of contract?\n\n&gt; Rothbard was referring to the state that obviously can't own anything legitimately. For individuals the current owner is presumed to be the rightful owner until the rightful owner can be found.\n\nWould you be able to cite the source for that? I'd like to look through it again myself.\n\n&gt; I don't think so. Most anarchists base ownership on possession. So the past owners have no baring on the rightful ownership.\n\nPast owners do have bearing on rightful ownership. You don't appear to understand possession. Imagine property. But instead of imagining it as a right to exclude, imagine it as a right not to be excluded from. That's basically possession.\n\n&gt; Anarchist don't have a definition of capitalism. Often they claim it is any organization that has hierarchy, but even their organizations have hierarchy (See mods at /r/Anarchism).\n\nNo it's not. Their definition of capitalism is not \"any organization that has hierarchy\". They will consider hierarchical productive organizations to be capitalist in nature but that isn't what they consider capitalism to be, that's a consequence of their being capitalist. Capitalism is an economy dominated by owners of capital.  &gt;Are you saying that it is right for them to violate contracts in situations absent aggression other than violation of contract?\n\nAs I indicated in the link, my point is that, the protection firms would be the ones enforcing contracts.  If a contact is not in the protection firms interest and their reputation and customer base will not suffer for ignoring a particular contract they with not bother to recognize it, especially when it is in the way of them growing their customer base and gaining restitution from one of their competitors.  So I think limited liability and exclusionary contracts will just not be recognized.\n\n&gt;Would you be able to cite the source for that?\n\nI don't remember it. I could have the details incorrect on Rothbard's opinion. I could have confused what Rothbard said with what Walter Block said.\n\n&gt;Imagine property. But instead of imagining it as a right to exclude, imagine it as a right not to be excluded from.\n\nThis is is a common saying among anarchists, but it is not accurate. Possessors do have the right to exclude other while in possession.  Anarchists just try to keep possession from seeming like a property right so they try to define it for what it is not, rather than what it is.  A communal farm in possession of crops on farmland will exclude non-members from the crops.  If they did not they could not survive.\n\n&gt;No it's not. Their definition of capitalism is not \"any organization that has hierarchy\". They will consider hierarchical productive organizations to be capitalist in nature but that isn't what they consider capitalism to be, that's a consequence of their being capitalist.\n\nYou are correct, I miss wrote capitalism instead of capitalist. &gt; As I indicated in the link, my point is that, the protection firms would be the ones enforcing contracts. If a contact is not in the protection firms interest and their reputation and customer base will not suffer for ignoring a particular contract they with not bother to recognize it, especially when it is in the way of them growing their customer base and gaining restitution from one of their competitors. So I think limited liability and exclusionary contracts will just not be recognized.\n\nI'm not sure what link you're talking about. What if a person enforces the contract personally rather than through some agency? They don't run into this problem, unless the agency is going to come back to them and take property transferred in accordance with a contract that the agency doesn't happen to like, which would pretty clearly be theft. Hardly a protection agency when they're aggressing against people.\n\n&gt; This is is a common saying among anarchists, but it is not accurate.\n\nIt is. The people taking a crop from someone else are excluding the farmers from their crop in doing so. If they were able to use it and not exclude the farmers from also using it, then there would be no injustice there. It only comes up to the extent that uses are mutually exclusive. It is not exclusion-because-that's-what-property-is, it's exclusion-because-we-can't-have-both-so-I-take-priority. Exclusion is a consequence, not the essence, of property. &gt;They don't run into this problem, unless the agency is going to come back to them and take property transferred in accordance with a contract that the agency doesn't happen to like, which would pretty clearly be theft. \n\nNo more theft than the freeing of slaves, in during the underground railroad.\n\n&gt;It only comes up to the extent that uses are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe definition of use can be interpreted differently.  And AnCom sees a shove not in anyone's hands as not being used.  Is grain stored in a communes grainery, being used? Can non-members use the grain? If the commune does not exclude non-members the commune would starve. So exclusion is necessary even when something is not in use.  Unless we broaden the meaning of use.  If we interpret speculation as a use then property is also just the right not to be excluded.  As someone else taking possession interferes with the use of speculation. So what link were you talking about?\n\n&gt; No more theft than the freeing of slaves, in during the underground railroad.\n\nThat was different because in that case slaves were considered property and had no independent legal standing. Making them from property into person is different. This is a case where a contract has been signed and you have decided that you don't need to hold up to your end of the bargain, and intend to prevent any efforts on the part of the other party to the contract to have the terminating conditions upheld. It is basically rejecting contract as a valid legal structure.\n\n&gt; The definition of use can be interpreted differently.\n\nI think you've confused the question of the nature of property as a right to exclude or against exclusion for the question of occupation and use. That's a pretty incoherent rant.\n\nAny system supporting ownership of territory is not anarchy. It is the distillate of the state. The difference between the existing system and anarcho-capitalism is that one features 200 states, one features 2 billion. Anarchism, by contrast, features zero states. Zero territorial monopolies.\n\nAny system supporting illegitimate ownership is inherently opposed to justice to the extent that it does. When anarcho-capitalists say it's wrong for people to destroy the property of people who might be leveraging the state's aggression against them, they are defending the state and its engine of injustice.

I guess you could technically consider it a company, but because of its form of organization it wouldn't be a capitalist form. Why do you feel that a collectively owned business would function better? Would everything be decided by voting? We know how horrible voting and democracy are and they almost never lead to the best decisions. What makes you think it will work here? What about investors who take risks and make it easier for the employee. They forgo present spending to save for the future, saving the others from having to do so. Labor alone does not create value. Don't give me that surplus nonsense. The reason their labor is more productive is because it is combined with the self sacrifice of the capitalist's investment. Oh, drop the attitude. I don't believe that you genuinely care about this, you just want to look like you showed everyone how the dumb little anarcho-noncapitalist's ideas are so self-evidently absurd. I don't like to have conversations of mutual hostility and refuse to have a conversation that is one sided in nature so either be civil, curious, and openminded or don't expect answers.\n\nI've answered the questions that I consider to reflect a genuine interest and I intend to ignore the rhetorical crap.\n\n&gt; Why do you feel that a collectively owned business would function better?\n\nA business owned by the employees will serve the interests of the employees better than any other form of ownership. I don't think I need to back this up with evidence, reasoning is sufficient to establish this.\n\n&gt; Would everything be decided by voting? \n\nNot everything, but that would probably be one step in resolving collective disagreements. &gt;A business owned by the employees will serve the interests of the employees better than any other form of ownership.\n\nOwnership of a company implies some risk-taking in the form of allocating capital without a guarantee of return on investment. Some peoples' interests are aligned with risk taking of this kind; other peoples' interests are not. Humans have a heterogeneous mix of risk aversion/affinity.\n\nAsserting that a company owned by the workers at large will necessarily serve the workers' interests better than some other form of ownership rests on the presumption that the workers all have some significant degree of risk affinity. Of course that's not necessarily true, and more often than not it's outright false. Many workers evidently prefer a steady income without ownership instead of an uncertain income with ownership. Oh, drop the attitude. I don't believe that you genuinely care about this, you just want to look like you showed everyone how the dumb little anarcho-noncapitalist's ideas are so self-evidently absurd.

The only remotely \"hostile\" thing would have been\n\n&gt;Don't give me that surplus nonsense.\n\nAnd that's because I've been in tiring debates with Youtube Marxists who just can't seem to grasp the concept of time preference, investment, and subjective value.\n\n&gt;I've answered the questions that I consider to reflect a genuine interest and I intend to ignore the rhetorical crap.\n\nWhat is rhetorical about investors taking risks, and saving for investment? Why can't you answer that?\n\n&gt;A business owned by the employees will serve the interests of the employees better than any other form of ownership. I don't think I need to back this up with evidence, reasoning is sufficient to establish this.\n\nI disagree, and thats why I pointed out that capitalists save the employees from the risk of loss, and from having to give up present spending. How is that not beneficial to them?\n\n&gt;Not everything, but that would probably be one step in resolving collective disagreements.\n\nCan you give some examples of it functioning otherwise? Wouldn't every starting step have to come from voting, otherwise it would just be an assertion of power by some people. &gt; What is rhetorical about investors taking risks, and saving for investment? Why can't you answer that?\n\nBecause you packaged it with the converse idea that some people don't want control over their own workplaces, don't want to own their jobs or their own business or be self-sufficient, and enjoy being pawns at their jobs, none of which is true of anybody I have ever met in my entire life. If you have questions of risk and savings then that's easily addressed as a separate issue, but as a facet of the bundle you tied it in with, it's largely a rhetorical justification for everything that's wrong with capitalism.\n\n&gt; How is that not beneficial to them?\n\nIt's like spitting on somebody's face and then offering them a handkerchief to wipe it off with, systemically depriving people of the means to support themselves and then protecting them from supposed risks. I've had an employer go out of business. They didn't care, they had tons of money. I lost my job. Some benefit it did me.\n\n&gt; Can you give some examples of it functioning otherwise?\n\nNo, you do what you want, and if other people don't like it, they can let you know, and if you can't come to an agreement on it between the two of you then have a vote on it. You could have managers that do what they think is needed and the people managed by them can impeach those decisions democratically. Why would everything need to be voting at the outset?\n\nDemocracy works great under freedom of association. Cooperatives are democratically managed and some of them are large and long-lasting organizations.  &gt;Because you packaged it with the converse idea that some people don't want control over their own workplaces, don't want to own their jobs or their own business or be self-sufficient, and enjoy being pawns at their jobs, none of which is true of anybody I have ever met in my entire life.\n\nWhen did I every say anything like people want no control over their own workplaces? You just pulled that out of nowhere. Someone offering you an opportunity out of their own hard work is not depriving you of anything. If you want complete control you can start your own business, or work your way up.\n\n&gt;It's like spitting on somebody's face and then offering them a handkerchief to wipe it off with, systemically depriving people of the means to support themselves and then protecting them from supposed risks. I've had an employer go out of business. They didn't care, they had tons of money. I lost my job. Some benefit it did me.\n\nI don't see how that is in anyway similar to spitting in someones face. This is the typical emotional leftist attitude that I just cannot stand. Who is depriving them of anything? How are they being deprived? Do you believe people are somehow entitled to the work of others? I severely doubt that your employer \"didn't care\" what kind of nonsense is that. You were not entitled to that job, they offered it to you and you accepted it. And it did benefit you, would you have been better off if it had never existed in the first place?\n\n&gt;No, you do what you want, and if other people don't like it, they can let you know, and if you can't come to an agreement on it between the two of you then have a vote on it. You could have managers that do what they think is needed and the people managed by them can impeach those decisions democratically. Why would everything need to be voting at the outset?\n\nSo you actually think this is a functional way for a business to work? This is why I asked you in the beginning how would a collectively owned business work better. So people just \"do whatever they want\" and if the others don't like it they can have a vote on it? What kind of a business model is that? It sounds messy and wasteful.\n\n&gt;Democracy works great under freedom of association. Cooperatives are democratically managed and some of them are large and long-lasting organizations.\n\nDemocracy does not work great. Cooperatives have an unfair advantage over private firms because they are tax exempt. And if cooperatives are so great, why are they so uncommon? If they are superior why are they not flourishing and on top? &gt; When did I every say anything like people want no control over their own workplaces?\n\nYou didn't directly say it, but it's a cost that is never recognized by capitalist advocates, and would destroy the \"it's good for the employees\" rhetoric if acknowledged. It's the same reasoning behind the viewpoint that slaves would die off if they didn't have white caretakers, so they should remain property. The rationale behind slavery falls apart if you acknowledge that it's not actually for their own good, and insinuating that it is, is downright offensive.\n\n&gt; Who is depriving them of anything?\n\nThe state and capitalists.\n\n&gt; How are they being deprived?\n\nThrough violence backing illegitimate property claims and privileges.\n\n&gt; Do you believe people are somehow entitled to the work of others?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; And it did benefit you, would you have been better off if it had never existed in the first place?\n\nIt's impossible to tell what would have happened without a time machine. I'd probably be just as well off with the exception that I'd be working for someone else who probably would not have gone out of business. So I can't say that I was better off than the alternative, no, because I don't know what the alternative precisely is. What I can say is, they didn't care that the business tanked because they were multimillionaires still making money off of their other ventures. Capitalism clearly does not protect employees from risk.\n\n&gt; So you actually think this is a functional way for a business to work?\n\nYes. Delegation of decisionmaking with a process for revision is how resolving conflicts within a company is generally done. Everyone does their job as they see fit until someone else complains and then they make some policy or something to fix it. It's not the entire model of business, that wasn't what you asked, and it's dishonest of you to act like I was supposed to explain in detail how every aspect of a business model that already exists is supposed to work.\n\n&gt; And if cooperatives are so great, why are they so uncommon? If they are superior why are they not flourishing and on top?\n\nBecause the capitalist form is propped up in a great number of other ways including the incentive structure of existing capitalism. If libertarianism is so great why aren't there more libertarian countries, huh? What a dishonest tactic. &gt; When did I every say anything like people want no control over their own workplaces?\n\nYou didn't directly say it, but it's a cost that is never recognized by capitalist advocates, and would destroy the \"it's good for the employees\" rhetoric if acknowledged. It's the same reasoning behind the viewpoint that slaves would die off if they didn't have white caretakers, so they should remain property. The rationale behind slavery falls apart if you acknowledge that it's not actually for their own good, and insinuating that it is, is downright offensive.\n\n&gt; Who is depriving them of anything?\n\nThe state and capitalists.\n\n&gt; How are they being deprived?\n\nThrough violence backing illegitimate property claims and privileges.\n\n&gt; Do you believe people are somehow entitled to the work of others?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; And it did benefit you, would you have been better off if it had never existed in the first place?\n\nIt's impossible to tell what would have happened without a time machine. I'd probably be just as well off with the exception that I'd be working for someone else who probably would not have gone out of business. So I can't say that I was better off than the alternative, no, because I don't know what the alternative precisely is. What I can say is, they didn't care that the business tanked because they were multimillionaires still making money off of their other ventures. Capitalism clearly does not protect employees from risk.\n\n&gt; So you actually think this is a functional way for a business to work?\n\nYes. Delegation of decisionmaking with a process for revision is how resolving conflicts within a company is generally done. Everyone does their job as they see fit until someone else complains and then they make some policy or something to fix it. It's not the entire model of business, that wasn't what you asked, and it's dishonest of you to act like I was supposed to explain in detail how every aspect of a business model that already exists is supposed to work.\n\n&gt; And if cooperatives are so great, why are they so uncommon? If they are superior why are they not flourishing and on top?\n\nBecause the capitalist form is propped up in a great number of other ways including the incentive structure of existing capitalism. If libertarianism is so great why aren't there more libertarian countries, huh? What a dishonest tactic. That's a pretty incoherent rant.\n\nAny system supporting ownership of territory is not anarchy. It is the distillate of the state. The difference between the existing system and anarcho-capitalism is that one features 200 states, one features 2 billion. Anarchism, by contrast, features zero states.

I don't know what flavor of anarchist you are, but most of the ones I've seen want small geographically-bound communities where authority is decided democratically... in other words, 2 billion tiny States. AnCaps on the other hand don't want to give geographical monopoly to any entity, not even democratically elected ones. Land owners, in contrast with communes, wouldn't have their own unique police and court systems.\n\nBut more telling than that, there are countless times I've seen comments in r/@ that were in explicit support of States as long as they are non-hierarchical and exist to subvert capitalism. &gt; It's honestly the exact opposite way around.\n\nIf you ignore monopoly, perhaps.\n\n&gt; I don't know what flavor of anarchist you are, but most of the ones I've seen want small geographically-bound communities where authority is decided democratically... in other words, 2 billion tiny States.\n\nI have never seen anarchists advocating geography as a necessary element of a community. I am a mutualist.\n\n&gt; AnCaps on the other hand don't want to give geographical monopoly to any entity, not even democratically elected ones.\n\nProperty in a way is monopoly, the right to exclude anyone else from competing claims on what you own. If you own territory, then you have a geographical monopoly. It's just a small one.\n\n&gt; Land owners, in contrast with communes, wouldn't have their own unique police and court systems.\n\nThose aren't essential to states, it's perfectly feasible to outsource those things. Current countries aren't small enough and are generally rival enough that it makes no sense for them to do so, but it's not impossible or essential to being a state to have your own police and court systems.\n\n&gt; But more telling than that, there are countless times I've seen comments in r/@ that were in explicit support of States as long as they are non-hierarchical and exist to subvert capitalism.\n\nI haven't seen any such things, to be clear do you mean supporting the existence of states, or supporting the actions of states which are being used to destroy another thing which is considered to be an evil? I can cheer the abolition of slavery in the US without favoring the state which abolished it. Even governments sometimes do what is right (though only after they create the problem in the first place). &gt;I have never seen anarchists advocating geography as a necessary element of a community.\n\nUnless these communities are strictly nomadic, you're being a bit disingenuous. Anyone in their right mind would defend what they have worked hard to build, whether communally or privately. They would keep obstructionists out of their society, and rightly so.\n\n&gt;Those aren't essential to states, it's perfectly feasible to outsource those things.\n\nSo a \"State\" outsources its law creation, law enforcement, and arbitration, and you would still consider it a State? Such a thing would undermine it completely...\n\nAs for the statements of r/@: [http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/17qiks/dear_ancaps_who_frequent_r_there_is_a_serious/c880zjf](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/17qiks/dear_ancaps_who_frequent_r_there_is_a_serious/c880zjf)\n\nThis is a fairly recent example I came across naturally.\n\nA quick search and I find:\n\n[http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/tziym/capitalism_is_inevitable_in_anarchy_if_you/c4r1nke](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/tziym/capitalism_is_inevitable_in_anarchy_if_you/c4r1nke)\n\n&gt;do you mean supporting the existence of states, or supporting the actions of states which are being used to destroy another thing which is considered to be an evil?\n\nIt's difficult to prove a pattern, but just consider what happens when there's an event where State power shrinks: Progressives blow a gasket, and Libertarians get giddy. (And let's face it, these are the ideological underpinnings of Anarchism and AnCapism) It's simply ridiculous to think that if you take it to the logical extreme of having no State at all, these roles would reverse. There's nothing inherent in communities that prohibits them from being nomadic so geography it isn't categorically relevant to communities.\n\n&gt; So a \"State\" outsources its law creation, law enforcement, and arbitration, and you would still consider it a State?

Supporting the actions of the State is supporting the existence of the State. It's not going to reach a critical point where the left is suddenly satisfied with the shrinking State, because when State power shrinks, capitalism grows, and they know what side they'd rather be on.

Scarcity of resources dictates a certain reality that cannot be avoided, a reality that almost presupposes territorial behavior amongst competing members.  It is a meta-phenomenon very much like natural selection.  If resources were abundant and endless, there would still be conflicting problems between an ideology that did not respect property and our physical universe, because two people cannot occupy the same space at the same time.\n\nI find it highly difficult to avoid the concept of self-ownership and private property on the basis that it is most consistent with reality as well as an ethical grounding that has merit.  \n\nFurthermore, cooperatives and collectives are not mutually exclusive from an individualist anarchist ideology, but your form of anarchism is most certainly mutually exclusive from an individualist ideology; to me, this speaks volumes ... unless I'm understanding your definition of anarchism wrong.\n\nUpvoted for thought-provoking post.

I am disappoint.\n\n&gt; used to agree that ancap was the only system that could exist without violent imposition, but that was before I genuinely understood anarchism and the framework of thought in which anarchists operate.\n\nSo do you now disagree that Ancap can exist without violent imposition or that both AnCap and traditional anarchism can exist without violent imposition. If you wouldn't mind, could you please go into more depth on the differences between \"frameworks of thought\"?\n\n&gt;Anarchists wouldn't act to destroy a company employing you.\n\nThat's actually not true; some anarchists may certainly do that, but many others would not.\n\n&gt;They'd be trying to offer you cooperative or collective or communal options that are better than the raw deal a capitalist employer can profitably offer until there is no profit left in ownership of capital, where your income in trade derives from what you do, not from what you own.\n\nAs t goes to infinity, profit goes to zero.

If you wouldn't mind, could you please go into more depth on the differences between \"frameworks of thought\"?\n\nTo be clear, I identify two types of ancap thought, \"Anarcho\"-capitalism (markets before anarchy) and anarcho-\"capitalism\" (anarchy before markets). The anarcho-\"capitalist\" in people would simply be surprised and not at all expecting the outcome that they get from anarchy. The \"anarcho\"-capitalists would be acting in unjust ways because capitalist flavored natural law says it's okay.\n\nSo kind of both, depending on how much capitalism an ancap is willing to give up to have anarchism.\n\n&gt; If you wouldn't mind, could you please go into more depth on the differences between \"frameworks of thought\"?\n\nAncaps and anarchists disagree on the meanings of such centrally important terms as \"property\", \"private property\", \"possession\", \"capitalism\", \"socialism\", \"voluntary\", \"aggression\", \"value\", and \"profit\". Anarchists have shortish terms for things that ancaps require paragraphs for, like \"exploitation\" and justice in pricing. Ancaps have a much more technical process for identifying aggression and its consequences than anarchists have (though they would call it injustice instead), so ancaps ignore entire categories of injustices that they can't identify as such. In all of these disagreements, the ancap framework of thought for what the thing is and what role it plays is different from the anarchist one. \"Voluntary\" seems simple on its face but anarchists understand it to mean whether you had a real choice or not, to them eating food is not voluntary because you have to eat food, and employment is not voluntary because you basically have to get a job to survive, there aren't any other good options available to most people. To an ancap, \"voluntary\" means nobody forced you to do it. To them, eating food is voluntary unless someone is threatening you if you don't eat the food, and employment is voluntary unless you are threatened into laboring against your will. Neither is wrong, but there is such a disconnect between them that even apparently successful communication often breaks down. Or \"profit\". To an anarchist, \"profit\" is readily distinguished against \"rent\" and \"wages\", while to an ancap, \"profit\" is most readily distinguished against \"insolvency\" or \"deficit\", or sometimes any perceived gain in value. There are times where I'll have a conversation with an anarchist here and some ancap will stop in and tell me that something I said wasn't true, when it is perfectly true in the framework of thought that I was speaking in at the time, but not in the framework of thought of the ancap, and I have to translate it into ancap.\n\nI think what it all comes down to is that anarchists perceive injustice intuitively and with nuance, ancaps are more like the radical skeptics, and refuse to see injustice unless you can demonstrate it mechanically (i.e. praxeologically) beginning with an act or threat of violence, and view it as a discrete binary condition of one or zero, aggressive or not, voluntary or not. The anarchist intuitive view lends itself to sympathetic understandings of human action within the context it happens in, how they would feel in the situations other people find themselves in, and so forth, while the ancap views it in terms of purely ordinal ranking value scales and marginal utility and views classes of people with different levels of risk aversion and time preference which they never look into the root causes of.\n\nThis mechanistic approach to justice is why Noam Chomsky said of anarcho-capitalism, \"And I also admire their commitment to rationality -- which is rare -- though I do not think they see the consequences of the doctrines they espouse, or their profound moral failings.\"\n\n(I personally make a great effort to have the anarchist intuitive perception of injustice and attempt to understand it through anarcho-capitalist mechanisms.)\n\n&gt; As t goes to infinity, profit goes to zero.

I.e. that something can be \"true\" in one framework but not in another. What \"truth\" really comes to mean then is: \"fits into a given framework\". Or \"is a logical part of some set of ideas\". It does not mean, \"is concurrent with reality\" or \"describes reality\".\n\nBtw by a \"framework of thought\", do you mean: 1) any abstractions or ideas whatsoever, whether they're meant to be empirical or not, OR 2) ideas that are supposed to describe reality?  &gt; This strikes me a part of post-modern discourse. I.e. that something can be \"true\" in one framework but not in another. What \"truth\" really comes to mean then is: \"fits into a given framework\". Or \"is a logical part of some set of ideas\". It does not mean, \"is concurrent with reality\" or \"describes reality\".\n\nIt's not, I believe that there's one reality and one truth. There are statements which an anarchist understands to mean one thing and an ancap understands to mean something else. Any particular statement of meaning can be true or false in comparison to reality, but the different frameworks of thought cause the words expressing that statement to be understood differently. It's like speaking two languages in which the same words exist but their meanings differ. What I say in one language forms a grammatical sentence in the other, but it doesn't express reality if interpreted as the wrong language.\n\n&gt; Btw by a \"framework of thought\", do you mean: 1) any abstractions or ideas whatsoever, whether they're meant to be empirical or not, OR 2) ideas that are supposed to describe reality?\n\nThe particular frameworks of thought I am talking about here are ideas that are supposed to explain (not necessarily describe) reality. To a large extent they aren't mutually exclusive but each have components that serve the roles needed to have satisfying answers. What is mutually exclusive is the vocabulary and rhetoric. I understand, but if I may, there's a bit of a conflation going on here. You are basically saying two things at once: 1) Anarcho-capitalists in general have a different meaning assigned to certain words. 2) Anarcho-capitalists have a different set of ideas or theories with which to either view or explain reality.\n\nYou must see that you're giving two different definitions of what a \"framework of thought\" is: One is a set of meanings assigned to words. The other is a set if ideas to, quote, \"explain (not necessarily describe) reality\".\n\nI'm just saying that you're \"living in words\". If that makes sense. I agree, but bundling in the words with the framework of thought is a useful endeavor here because the frameworks of thought and vocabularies are so closely tied together, they are tightly correlated and used to understand each other. I'd rather there just be one framework with one vocabulary useful for discussing the topic combining elements of both, a much greater depth of conversation could occur if there was. I understand but I'm telling you man, this is a really dangerous methodology. It's basically censorship and thought control. Since one is mandating an \"approved\" lens with which to view the world or to engage in debate.\n\nIf you really want fruitful discussion you have to skip these \"frameworks\" and focus only on understanding the empirical meaning behind a speaker's use of words. That's really the whole point of a discussion, i.e. the exchange of information. I promise you things will be much clearer if you do.\n\nHave you seen Stef's philosophy videos? I don't see how it is censorship or thought control any more than it is to know how to speak both spanish and english, not speaking spanish to english speakers and not speaking english to spanish speakers. I don't know what you mean by mandating an approved lens, it's just speaking the language and culture of the person I'm talking to. There is a deeper insight to be gained by understanding the world through two frameworks at the same time.\n\n&gt; If you really want fruitful discussion you have to skip these \"frameworks\" and focus only on understanding the empirical meaning behind a speaker's use of words.\n\nThe way you understand the empirical meaning behind a speaker's use of words is by understanding the framework in which they choose those words, not by understanding how everybody else uses those words.\n\n&gt; That's really the whole point of a discussion, i.e. the exchange of information. I promise you things will be much clearer if you do.\n\nClarity is great, but I had that before I started trying to understand other peoples' ideas as they understand them, i.e. in the framework and context in which the speaker is saying them. Since then I've discovered a level of depth I hadn't recognized prior, and I have been trying to bring clarity to that. Language is not the limiting factor for me personally thinking about these things, it's only the limiting factor in communicating about them, and communicating about them in the respectively appropriate ways to ancaps and anarchists is much more successful than communicating them in one way to the other.\n\n&gt; Have you seen Stef's philosophy videos?\n\nI know of them and have seen a few, but largely ignore him because I have also seen his debate videos where he uses obnoxiously disingenuous tactics. That's a pretty incoherent rant.\n\nAny system supporting ownership of territory is not anarchy. It is the distillate of the state.

You, of course, are simply too busy to disprove anything Zhwazi has stated (after all, you can simply repeat something has happened over and over again until it becomes accepted), but I'm sure you could if you tried! You must be pretty busy because this pretty much all you do these days. Well, you're right about one thing. I'm pretty busy. I bet, it takes time trawling across Reddit making these one-sentence, veiled personal attack potshots at people you don't like or disagree with. Oh yah, I'm totally not doing other things with life.     On a basic level, I might agree.\n\nHowever, the \"-ism\" has unfortunately become much stronger recently, turning AnCap-ism into more of a belief system, rather than simply 'anarchists' who respect persons and property. &gt;rather than simply 'anarchists' who respect persons and property\n\nDon't we need a little bit more elaboration than that to separate ourselves from Mutualism?  I could see ancom becoming the norm post-scarcity, but until then, don't make no sense. I could see ancom becoming the norm post-scarcity, but until then, don't make no sense.    &gt; I was reading in an anarchist subreddit and someone posted how \"anarchists\" destroyed some private property\n\nWas it by any chance in SRSAnarchists?  Was it the submission about radical feminists throwing bricks through a frat house's windows? Yes, I upvoted your comments there haha There arguments against you kinda of motivated this post. Heh, I had a hunch.  It's just impossible to come to any agreement with them on anything when your views and theirs are so fundamentally opposed. I always thought the biggest issue with anarchists was the state... not the fact that everything isn't handed to them on a platter no matter what job they have. Meh whatever. The funny thing is...  In an AnCap world, they would be allowed to have their own little community of communists/whatever they're styling themselves as these days.  But in an AnCom world, we would not be allowed to have our own little voluntary community.  I think the most telling difference between voluntarism and anarcho-collectivism is that our ideology permits the existence of other-minded communities, while theirs does not. Ours is live-and-let-live, while theirs is \"my way or I kill you.\" That's not a difference, that is true of both. How so? The way justice works under voluntarism relies more on passive measures like insurance and ostracism, rather than on punitive violence.\n\nThe capitalist and the communist differ so fundamentally on what belongs to who that they should just stay away from each other. A voluntarist civilization permits such a thing. A communist civilization would just kill the capitalist. &gt; How so?\n\nBecause both are live and let live, assuming they are both actually standing fast to the \"let live\".\n\n&gt; The way justice works under voluntarism relies more on passive measures like insurance and ostracism, rather than on punitive violence.\n\nNo it's not. Statements true of your fantasy pacifist society are not categorically true of voluntaryism. Voluntarists don't necessarily reject violence in defense or to obtain restitution or retribution.\n\n&gt; The capitalist and the communist differ so fundamentally on what belongs to who that they should just stay away from each other. A voluntarist civilization permits such a thing. A communist civilization would just kill the capitalist.\n\nThinking that two civilizations can remain separate from each other is stupid and unrealistic. A voluntarist civilization is more tolerant only in the sense that it fails to recognize forms of aggression that communists and everyone else readily identifies. &gt; Voluntarists don't necessarily reject violence in defense or to obtain restitution or retribution.\n\nNo, they don't, and neither do the communists. Market-driven justice has as its primary goal making the victim whole again, which may involve compelling the perpetrator only as long as it's the most cost-effective measure. In many cases insurance alone would suffice.\n\nCommunists on the other hand, see a crime against the collective behind every bush, and such violations must be exterminated at all costs.\n\n&gt; Thinking that two civilizations can remain separate from each other is stupid and unrealistic. A voluntarist civilization is more tolerant only in the sense that it fails to recognize forms of aggression that communists and everyone else readily identifies.\n\nPerhaps I am too naive and you're right that the two can't coexist. I can see how hard it might be to have a civilized society based on free trade, and the mutually empowering cooperation inherent to commerce, while a village of ~~subsistence-farming~~ communists stews in resentment nearby. They would presumably see themselves as being \"passively exploited\" by the success of the city, and therefore entitled to some nebulously defined share of its riches. The village would declare war almost instantly.\n\nedit: They may not be necessarily subsistence farmers. There would most likely be a black market present in the village that provided some of the more rebellious inhabitants some modern comforts like toilet paper and pencils.   Yet another thread where people waste time arguing over what words \"really mean\" rather than just defining their terms then arguing why their ideas are valuable.\n\nAnticapitalists have used the term \"anarchist\" for far longer than anarcho-capitalism has even existed. Just stop wasting time claiming that they \"stole\" the word (as if that's even possible) and start arguing about what matters: their ideas for arranging society. And recognize that you look uneducated when you claim that anticapitalists are trying to \"steal\" terms like \"anarchism\" and \"libertarianism,\" when they have actually been using them far longer than we have. &gt;And recognize that you look uneducated when you claim that anticapitalists are trying to \"steal\" terms like \"anarchism\" and \"libertarianism,\"\n\nHe never actually explicitly said any of that; you're projecting. I never said that he explicitly said any of that; you're projecting (actually, that's not projecting, it's just poor reading comprehension). I'm merely reiterating an extremely common trend on this subreddit that is associated with claims like OP made, such as \"true meanings\" of words. &gt;poor reading comprehension\n\nSo, when you say,\n\n&gt;Just stop wasting time claiming that they \"stole\" the word\n\nit's a command to the members of this subbreddit and not the OP?  Well, fair enough then, but I would still regard your statements as easily confused for being directed at the OP, given that most isolated responses within threads are directed at the OP.\n\nI'm having a hell of a fun night atm, either way; it's unfortunate that you seem so butthurt.  Hope you feel better. &gt; it's a command to the members of this subbreddit and not the OP?\n\nUmmm, yeah. Comments are just that, *comments*, not direct replies to the OP. Of course, it's also not a *command*. It's a recommendation.\n\n&gt; it's unfortunate that you seem so butthurt. Hope you feel better.\n\nNice! You used the word \"butthurt\" and were needlessly condescending in the same paragraph, so now we know you're a citizen of reddit! I'll make sure to not let you know if I find somewhere to go where meaningful discourse still occurs. Yet another thread where people waste time arguing over what words \"really mean\" rather than just defining their terms then arguing why their ideas are valuable.\n\nAnticapitalists have used the term \"anarchist\" for far longer than anarcho-capitalism has even existed.

And recognize that you look uneducated when you claim that anticapitalists are trying to \"steal\" terms like \"anarchism\" and \"libertarianism,\" when they have actually been using them far longer than we have. I never claimed they stole the term.  I never claimed that you did. I'm *commenting* on your post, not responding directly to you.  Capitalism is antithetical to Anarchism because Anarchism in a nutshell opposes all social hierarchies. I don't care which dictionary says it's just the lack of a State, the first people to call themselves \"anarchists\" did so with the intent of such a belief, \"Anarchism\", being anti-capitalist just as much as anti-state.\n\nThe first person to call themselves an anarchist is thought to be Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who is considered to be one of the founders of Mutualism, a branch of Anarchism as it is today. \n\nYou also show a lack of understanding on the social anarchist's views. We don't care about the NAP (as a generality). We have our own ethics. None of us believe in private property, rather, we favor personal property, or communal property, or something. We have solutions to issues that are on par with the \"An\"Cap counterparts. To us, Capitalism is oppressive, and to you, it's not. That's what this will all boil down to.\n\n So in your ideal society, if I were to voluntarily join a hierarchy in the form of a baseball team, what should happen to me as a result? Assuming I should be punished, who should do the punishing? If the answer is there should be no retaliation, then what's the difference between you and an ancap who believes in voluntary interaction, including freedom to voluntarily join a hierarchy? What a fucking straw man. Are you fucking serious? Is everyone equal on the baseball team? Does anyone deserve anything more because of which position they play? I'd argue not. It's not a fucking hierarchy. Just because everyone has a different role doesn't mean that there's a fucking hierarchy. Take a deep breath and calm down.. A baseball team is one of countless examples of hierarchies, assuming you haven't redefined that term to suit your ideology. There's all sorts of ranks and positions of power for any organized sports team above and below the players. The baseball team part is irrelevant though, what matters is the fact that unless you plan on enforcing this 'no hierarchy' social policy then how is your system different?  Capitalism is antithetical to Anarchism because Anarchism in a nutshell opposes all social hierarchies. I don't care which dictionary says it's just the lack of a State, the first people to call themselves \"anarchists\" did so with the intent of such a belief, \"Anarchism\", being anti-capitalist just as much as anti-state.\n\nThe first person to call themselves an anarchist is thought to be Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who is considered to be one of the founders of Mutualism, a branch of Anarchism as it is today. \n\nYou also show a lack of understanding on the social anarchist's views.

That's what this will all boil down to.\n\n Are you pacifists then if you don't believe in social hierarchy? It seems like you have to have some kind of hierarchy if you ever plan to use force, even defensively.  Using force in defense is the countering of an imposed hierarchy. There are anarcho-pacifists, but I'm a mutualist, personally. I hold that the basis for any free society is one of mutuality and reciprocity, as opposed to other standards such as \"voluntarity\". If we all followed the Golden Rule instead of worrying what's \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\", we surely establish a more sound standard for liberty. &gt;Using force in defense is the countering of an imposed hierarchy.\n\nThis doesn't seem correct to me. \"Defense\" is relative to a certain set of assumptions, for example, so to defend means you are giving your preferences primacy. Isn't this a social hierarchy, then?\n\nAlso, if you are engaging in forceful defense, aren't you imposing your own hierarchy? You are saying that your preferences are superior to those of the people you are directing the force against. You are using force to gain their submission. Isn't this evidence of a social hierarchy?\n\n\nI also have some trouble with the moral calculus underlying the golden rule. For example, if I want to go to the ball game, but my wife wants to go to the symphony, then the golden rule says the best possible outcome would be for me to wind up at the symphony and wifey to turn up at the ball game. To me, this outcome seems to be the worst possible outcome of the 4 available options, though. \n\nI think that a rule like the golden rule, but passive (\"don't do to others things which you don't want done to you\") is more productive, but it's like the NAP in not providing guidance on what to do. It only says what not to do.  &gt;This doesn't seem correct to me. \"Defense\" is relative to a certain set of assumptions, for example, so to defend means you are giving your preferences primacy. Isn't this a social hierarchy, then?\nAlso, if you are engaging in forceful defense, aren't you imposing your own hierarchy? You are saying that your preferences are superior to those of the people you are directing the force against. You are using force to gain their submission. Isn't this evidence of a social hierarchy?\n\nAbsolutely not. It doesn't matter if you think your preferences are above others, that in itself isn't hierarchy. Using force on others to satisfy your preferences is, and returning force is mutual enmity.\n\n&gt;I also have some trouble with the moral calculus underlying the golden rule. For example, if I want to go to the ball game, but my wife wants to go to the symphony, then the golden rule says the best possible outcome would be for me to wind up at the symphony and wifey to turn up at the ball game.

It only says what not to do.\n\nFirst of all, we're talking about an ethical code, not a how to impose your preferences code. And also, the Golden Rule includes the negative form you quoted. It's even on the Wiki page. &gt;...Using force on others to satisfy your preferences is...\n\nIs that not precisely what you are doing when you \"defend\" with force?\n\n&gt;First of all, we're talking about an ethical code, not a how to impose your preferences code. \n\nThe point of either is to select actions, so I don't see how this distinction matters here.  Can you elaborate on the distinction?\n\n&gt;And also, the Golden Rule includes the negative form you quoted. It's even on the Wiki page.\n\nOkay, I didn't realize that both versions were called \"The Golden Rule.\" Which one are you referring to in your response up above?\n &gt;Is that not precisely what you are doing when you \"defend\" with force?\n\nIt doesn't matter, it's a false dichotomy. Using force to defend yourself from another's force is satisfying your preference but it's to defend yourself from someone else using force on you to satisfy their own preferences. It's hierarchical to not defend yourself, and anarchic to defend yourself.\n\n&gt;The point of either is to select actions, so I don't see how this distinction matters here. Can you elaborate on the distinction?\n\nWe're talking about how we ought to behave not how to get away with shit. I don't know how else to put it.\n\n&gt;Okay, I didn't realize that both versions were called \"The Golden Rule.\" Which one are you referring to in your response up above?\n\nMore so on the negative version, but really, the rule is pretty good both ways. &gt;Using force to defend yourself from another's force is satisfying your preference but it's to defend yourself from someone else using force on you to satisfy their own preferences.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that it is using force to impose the supremacy of your own preferences, though. Isn't that exactly what a social hierarchy is? \n\n&gt;We're talking about how we ought to behave...\n\nHow you think one ought to behave is just an expression of your preferences, though.\n\n&gt;More so on the negative version, but really, the rule is pretty good both ways.\n\nHow do you address the shortcomings of the positive form of the rule like the one I mentioned previously?\n\nIf you cleave to the negative version, why do you not care about the NAP? The NAP is a specific instance of the negative version, limited to actions which are aggressive. &gt;That doesn't change the fact that it is using force to impose the supremacy of your own preferences, though. Isn't that exactly what a social hierarchy is?\n\nNo. You've got it wrong. Everything starts off anarchic. Someone imposes their will on another, and we have a hierarchy. By countering this will imposition with your own, you effectively mutualize things. It's no longer hierarchic. It's a state of mutual enmity. Social hierarchy comes when there are unanswered impositions. Imposing one's will on another is only an imposition of hierarchy if it's the first imposition involved. Much like how defending yourself isn't an initiation of force, according to your NAP.\n\n&gt;How you think one ought to behave is just an expression of your preferences, though.\n\nTrue. But this is something everyone is guilty of. Even you.\n\n&gt;How do you address the shortcomings of the positive form of the rule like the one I mentioned previously?\nIf you cleave to the negative version, why do you not care about the NAP? The NAP is a specific instance of the negative version, limited to actions which are aggressive.\n\nI don't just end myself at the Golden Rule. The Golden Rule is a great ethical basis, though. It's not *the* code for my society. It's *a* code.\n\nAnd the NAP doesn't extend to nonphysical violence such as exploitation and social hierarchy. It ends at physical force and the threat of it. It's an exploiter's wet dream.",

    "snippet" : "HELP, debating a statist. not really a heated debate, but he almost has me stumped. Basically he is saying things like Cancer research would be nearly impossible because people wouldn't want to risk spending that much money on research when the outcome is so unknown. How would cancer research be carried out?\n\nEDIT: Not just cancer, all medicine. Basically, looking for a cure, risking the fact that you may never find it, in hopes that you one day will, and become uber rich. This is a risk government takes easily because it essentially has nothing to lose. Why is anarchy better, when Government could find the solution potentially faster. \n\nEdit 2: After going through these rather unsatisfactory comments. I find that one user had the best response. from czMotig:\nA cancer research...I don't know. I believe that in Ancapistan, there are many big private competing players who have the motivation for a cancer research - e.g. insurance companies and pharmacy companies, hospitals, general practitioners...whose motivation motivates privately run medical/insurance/cancer science schools...whose motivation motivates companies whose motivation in turn motivates healthy, cancer free people...\n\nStep up your game ancaps... This was just a test.   If people don't want to do it, why should we worry about getting it done? Apparently nobody thinks it's worth the money! But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? What do you mean by \"demand\"? The only economically meaningful \"demand\" is when people act to spend scarce resources/money on something. But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? ive been demanding a hover board for years, and they still wont invent them!\n\nthere is a difference between psychological demand, and economic demand. if they are unwilling to donate money to research, obviously there is no economic demand. I bet I could find someone trying to invent a hover board.  But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? But, we know that people do want a cure for cancer. The demand is there for a cure, how can we meet the demand? If there's enough demand, that means there would be more profit. The less entrepreneurs want to invest in it, the more rewarding it will become for the entrepreneur who would invest in it.\n\nNow if you say that without the government people wouldn't invest in cancer research then **its like saying without the govt people wouldn't care about profits anymore**. but, its the risk factor, what good company would put that much money into research if the risk of actually finding the cure is so high?  Like it is now, charity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_UK Speaking directly, many of these \"cancer charities\" do a rather poor job. Poor in comparison to perfection, but stellar in comparison to government programs. Not to mention the morality of taxation. Got a citation?  It's quite hard to define ____/$ output of cancer research specifically because a cure hasn't been found.\n\nI'm just generalising from every other example of private firm vs govt in the history of the state. Speaking directly, many of these \"cancer charities\" do a rather poor job. Does Cancer Research UK do a poor job? is there a cure for cancer?  A lot of people, everywhere, voluntarily donate money for cancer research completely outside of anything to do with the state.  People who have lost loved ones, concerned citizens, etc.   A huge chunk of charitably donations go towards fighting cancer.  An example would be that they have those sponsored runs / walks and shit.  Where people walk, run, or bike a certain distance and sponsors pay X amount per participant that goes towards fighting the ailment of the month.  And there will always be incentives for medical / pharmaceutical companies to invest in new cures / medications...     Do you know that there is a scientifically proven-to-be-effective method to become healthy and live longer?\n\nIt's called exercising.\n\nWhy don't people exercise? That's a moral problem, not a medical one. Medical science, other than keeping you alive, can't make you healthier or happier. This is for a different domain.\n\nThere is enormous demand for cancer remedies. The first one to find one will earn enormous benefits, whether it is a new drug, or a new lifestyle. &gt;Medical science, other than keeping you alive, can't make you healthier or happier.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding your point, but this seems like a completely absurd statement to me.  If I have a non-fatal disease, and medical science cures or treats me, it seems like it has made me healthier in a way other than keeping me alive.  Happiness is pretty subjective, but I think relief from medical issues would make most people happier. You may be cured of a disease, but that doesn't mean your resting heart rate has improved. I think curing a disease counts as making you healthier even if it doesn't improve your resting heart rate. It doesn't. You will catch a new disease. Sure, but most people will catch diseases at some point.  Are you seriously suggesting that medical treatment can't improve someone's health? Yes. Catching a disease is a matter of probability that is affected by lifestyle, not medical science. Right, but we can cure many of the diseases that people catch.  How is it not improving their health to cure them of a disease? Because their health remains the same. They are just as prone to developing disease as before.   I suppose you're insane, or something, if you think that most cancers are caused by environmental factors that themselves are caused largely by government actions that are covered up.\n\nOr if you think that an effective and cheap cure for a particular strain of cancer would almost certainly be suppressed in favour of an ineffective, expensive, and harmful one from Big Pharma.   I had a similar debate with a friend of mine over a technological advance in general. He said things like controlled nuclear fission (or fusion? I don't even science...) and research in particle physics (?) and many other fields could not be possible without the state. My starting argument was that a state does not need the science, but he responded that the science needs the state, because private corporations would never invest large amounts of money in something with 99% risk of not discovering or inventing anything.\n\nAnd I believe my friend was right. Current private corporations will never have the amount of wealth states currently have for development and research because (at least in the EU) there are huge expenses in regulations and taxes. Bigger the company, bigger and complex the laws you have to follow and greater the taxes you have to pay - it's absurd. People keep believeng companies will never have the interest in cancer research but they simply do not posses the wealth for investing in something like that.\n\nYes, there are certainly arguments that a state institutions/schools managed to discover or invent something but I believe that's a blind statement. State inistitutions/schools managed to do that only from the taxes which we are forced to pay but the results of actually inventing/discovering something are the same as if a company did the research from its own private money. A company will always pursue the profit as it is natural for it and it will do that with the market competition in mind. But the state? The state will point a gun at your head, the state will tell you to pay taxes for the research you do not care about, the state will force you to go to the prison if you don't pay.\n\nA cancer research...I don't know. I believe that in Ancapistan, there are many big private competing players who have the motivation for a cancer research - e.g. insurance companies and pharmacy companies, hospitals, general practitioners...whose motivation motivates  privately run medical/insurance/cancer science schools...whose motivation motivates companies whose motivation in turn motivates healthy, cancer free people...\n\nI believe that in Ancapistan, you would not even need charities for cancer research since without forced expenses and regulations, I can imagine that insurance companies would simply LOVE to convince people that they really care for their health and they would offer them to pay for the cancer research as a part of their insurance, which their customers voluntarily paid for in the first place.

    "snippet" : "My friend brought it up to me and i'm wondering if a free market makes this any better?  Companies generally try to sell things to people. Refusing sales to a group of people based on their skin colour or whatever just helps your competitors. Ok but how do you explain the status quo then? Is it difficult for other lenders to lend to minorities or something? Minorities are generally poorer and have worse credit. This.  There's no conspiracy here - only disparities in handling credit. Disparities in handling credit don’t even begin to explain the gap in wealth between blacks and whites. ([White Americans currently have 22 times more wealth than blacks](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/21/news/economy/wealth-gap-race/index.htm).)\n\nFor example, one factor decreasing the relative wealth of blacks is housing segregation: [whites tend to prefer living with other whites](http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~tforman/publications/Krysan_Couper_Farley_Forman_AJS_2009.pdf). Because there are more whites than blacks in the United States, homes in white neighborhoods are generally in higher demand than homes in black neighborhoods, and are therefore worth more money. The relatively low prices of homes in black neighborhoods reduce blacks’ overall wealth, and this wealth disparity impedes efforts overcome poverty, e.g. by using home-equity loans to finance a college education, start a business, etc. (The free market wouldn’t solve this.)\n\nIt’s interesting to note in the cited study that blacks do not exhibit the same preference toward segregated housing that whites do; that is, they tend to appraise houses in multiracial neighborhoods at a higher value than similar houses in either solidly white or black neighborhoods, which rather ironically exacerbates the lack of demand for houses in black neighborhoods that leads to the aforementioned wealth disparity in the first place. And when a sizable number of blacks or other minorities actually do move into a white neighborhood, the result is often whites re-segregating themselves through [white flight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight), resulting in a wealth-destroying drop in real-estate prices.\n\nSo when I hear libertarians and AnCaps disparaging the belief that centuries of slavery and discrimination are not even a *little* to blame for the inequality between whites and minorities using veiled language like\n\n&gt;There's no conspiracy here - only disparities in handling credit.\n\nI see it for what it is: a more polite form of\n\n&gt;Of course minorities are poorer than us whites - they’re naturally inferior. &gt;Disparities in handling credit don’t even begin to explain the gap in wealth between blacks and whites.\n\nExcept for the fact that they are a significant factor.\n\n&gt;For example, one factor decreasing the relative wealth of blacks is housing segregation: whites tend to prefer living with other whites.\n\nFirst, blacks tend to prefer living with other blacks, as well.  And Asians prefer living with other Asians.  I've seen instances where Korean immigrants and Chinese immigrants intentionally segregate in where they live.  That people prefer to live with other people that generally share their interests and culture is not an evil conspiracy.\n\nSecond, your economic reasoning is flawed.  Having cheaper houses would not cause a disparity in wealth - it is an effect of it.  They make less money and have less credit and THAT leads to buying cheaper homes.  The flight to the suburbs was not a \"white flight\", but a cultural shift that occurred first in the middle class.\n\n&gt;It’s interesting to note in the cited study that blacks do not exhibit the same preference toward segregated housing that whites do; that is, they tend to appraise houses in multiracial neighborhoods at a higher value than similar houses in either solidly white or black neighborhoods\n\nDoes not follow.  You are assuming discrimination to prove discrimination.  And I'm not saying there could never be discrimination, but you are blithely ignoring cultural affinities for certain kinds of areas, and also ignoring that multiracial neighborhoods tend to be lower-income areas, while the average white (being wealthier than the average black) seeks out higher-income areas which are more segregated as a result of economic disparity.\n\n&gt;So when I hear libertarians and AnCaps disparaging the belief that centuries of slavery and discrimination are not even a little to blame for the inequality\n\n[Economically, there was more equality during slavery and discrimination.](http://www.amazon.com/Race-Economics-Blamed-Discrimination-PUBLICATION/dp/0817912452)  Government was necessary to create inequality - mainly through union laws when unions were \"whites only\".  And, no, I'm not saying that slavery and discrimination didn't matter - just that they aren't a factor now, and the reason that the inequality continues to exist is because of, frankly, the welfare system that incentivizes a maintenance of poverty, poor credit, and illegitimate childbirth.\n\n&gt;I see it for what it is: a more polite form of\n\n&gt;&gt;Of course minorities are poorer than us whites - they’re naturally inferior.\n\nRight.  I'm an Asian supremacist!  \"Us whites\" are just inferior to them, and that's why they succeed more.  Because I'm racist (must be, since I'm white and everything) - you proved it, just like you proved that cultural factors don't matter ever.\n &gt; Does not follow. You are assuming discrimination to prove discrimination. And I'm not saying there could never be discrimination, but you are blithely ignoring cultural affinities for certain kinds of areas, and also ignoring that multiracial neighborhoods tend to be lower-income areas, while the average white (being wealthier than the average black) seeks out higher-income areas which are more segregated as a result of economic disparity.\n\nIt is not an assumption that whites tend to prefer living in white neighborhoods while blacks tend to prefer living in multiracial neighborhoods, and that these preferences hold regardless of social class of the neighborhood’s residents. Rather, it’s a finding of the study [“Does Race Matter? Results From a Video Experiment”](http://userwww.service.emory.edu/%7Etforman/publications/Krysan_Couper_Farley_Forman_AJS_2009.pdf), in which thousands of randomly sampled black and white participants were shown videos of different neighborhoods with varying racial composition and social class. When asked to rate how desirable each neighborhood was to live in,\n\n&gt;African-Americans rated as most desirable the neighborhood that was of the highest social class (mean = 5.85) and as least desirable the neighborhood with the lowest social class (mean = 3.63). However, we also find that race of residents, independent of social class, shapes neighborhood preferences. That is, race of residents in the video is a significant predictor (F = 4.87; df = 2, 1128; P = .008; see table 4)—above and beyond social class. The mixed neighborhoods, as hypothesized, were rated as most desirable, followed by the black neighborhoods and then the white neighborhoods.\n\nThis is why I claimed that blacks prefer to live in multiracial neighborhoods (independent of social class) more than either solidly white or black neighborhoods. What was your reasoning when you claimed that “…blacks tend to prefer living with other blacks, as well”? Was *that* an assumption?\n\n&gt; Second, your economic reasoning is flawed. Having cheaper houses would not cause a disparity in wealth - it is an effect of it.\n\nI certainly agree that blacks having less than one twentieth of the wealth of whites contributes to their collective inability to afford homes priced similarly to whites. But being poor in the first place seriously impedes efforts to improve credit and overcome poverty. It’s hard build good credit if banks aren’t willing to lend to you on account of your lack of liquidatable assets (e.g. house). It’s difficult to *buy* assets if you’re poor and don’t make a lot of money. It’s immeasurably difficult to gain wealth if your lack of credit precludes you from securing a college loan to improve you job prospects, or a business loan to become an entrepreneur.\n\n&gt;The flight to the suburbs was not a \"white flight\", but a cultural shift that occurred first in the middle class.\n\nI don’t deny that suburbanization was a cultural shift that occurred in the middle class, but it was one blacks were excluded from. Housing compacts prevented blacks from owning many white suburban homes, and redlining tremendously reduced the prices of homes blacks already lived in by reducing the availability of loans (reducing demand) available to move into these areas. In rare occasions when blacks did move into previously white suburban neighborhoods, real estate brokers often engaged in [blockbusting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting), where they convinced whites to sell their homes lest racial diversity decrease real estate prices. (And of course property values *did* decrease, as more and more whites' homes were put on the market, resulting in fat commissions for brokers but a reduction in wealth for the newly arrived blacks.) But white flight is a more general phenomenon that still occurs today. Even in middle class areas of my native Silicon Valley, for example, [many white parents have removed their children from high schools attended by large numbers of Asians](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB113236377590902105.html).\n\n&gt; Economically, there was more equality during slavery and discrimination.\n\nHmm, where do you stand on the whole enslaving-blacks-from-birth thing? Because I’m against it, and no amount of Orwellian blackwhite horseshit will ever convince me that “economic freedom” means *anything* if someone else can deny you the ability to read and write, or sell your children, or keep you from owning *any property at all*. (You believe in individual sovereignty and self-ownership, right? And you believe that economic freedom means, at the very least, the freedom to actually own things?) Even supposing that you could convince me that slavery in the United States resulted in more economic freedom than not-slavery, you’ve made no argument: you’ve given me no reason at all to believe you, or to believe that *you* even have a reason to believe whatever’s in that fucking asinine book you’ve linked me. (Do you repost that link without an argument because you don't have one?)\n\n&gt;Right…you proved it, just like you proved that cultural factors don't matter ever.\n\nI’m aware that the term “straw-man” gets thrown around haphazardly on Reddit, but I’ve truly never seen a better example of one. Where did I argue that “cultural factors don’t matter ever”? Nowhere.\n\n&gt; …the reason that the inequality continues to exist is because of, frankly, the welfare system that incentivizes a maintenance of poverty, poor credit, and illegitimate childbirth.\n\nI do, in fact, believe that the US welfare system encourages a culture of poverty among some blacks, just as it does in some whites, Asian, Latinos, etc. But that doesn’t begin to account for the inequality of wealth between blacks and whites. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity), there are 39 million blacks in the United States. And according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, as qouted in [Statistic Brain](http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/), 40% of the 4.3 million Americans on welfare are black – that’s 1.7 million blacks on welfare, or 4.4% of the black population of the United States. The claim you're making, that 4.4% of the black population is responsible for cutting the median wealth of the remaining 95.6% into one 22nd of the median wealth of whites, is statistically illiterate.\n\n&gt;Right. I'm an Asian supremacist! Because I'm racist (must be, since I'm white and everything) - you proved it…\n\nOops, I guess you’re actually Asian. That has nothing to do with whether or not you are a racist. (Take, for example, the Japanese members of Unit 731, who justified barbarous biological experimentation and torture of Chinese people on the basis that they were worthless sub-human “logs.”) One of the many reasons I believe you’re a racist is that you subscribe to the paternalistic idea that enslaving blacks was somehow beneficial to them. *Are* you racist? *Do* you believe that race makes some groups of people inferior to others? &gt;Disparities in handling credit don’t even begin to explain the gap in wealth between blacks and whites.\n\nExcept for the fact that they are a significant factor.\n\n&gt;For example, one factor decreasing the relative wealth of blacks is housing segregation: whites tend to prefer living with other whites.\n\nFirst, blacks tend to prefer living with other blacks, as well.

Because I'm racist (must be, since I'm white and everything) - you proved it, just like you proved that cultural factors don't matter ever.\n Let me just go ahead and repeat this so the stupidity of what you said might linger in the air a moment longer.\n\n&gt;Economically, there was more equality during slavery and discrimination.\n\n...and again, let go, embrace just how fucking dumb you must be to make a statement like this.\n\n&gt;Economically, there was more equality during slavery and discrimination.\n\n...and once more for good measure, you foolish, foolish boy. \n\n&gt;Economically, there was more equality during slavery and discrimination.\n\nMoron. The fact remains, that between black laborers and white laborers, there was more economic equality in, say, 1880, then now.  Even under slavery, many black slaves worked for others than their masters to earn some money, and were paid in similar amounts as to the white labor (they were forced to give some of it to their master, unfortunately).\n\nIt's just too bad that your thought processes can't go beyond \"slavery = bad\" to actually examine how bad it was, or to look at *free blacks* (i.e. **not slaves**) and compare the supposed effects of discrimination - especially between the Civil War and the 1920s or so, when the discrimination started becoming more backed by government, but also when their fellow blacks were still enslaved - with the negative effects of the welfare programs *on an economic level*.  I suppose some people are just too dumb to analyze subjects with heavy emotional connotations.  Sorry to have bothered your feeble, emotion-clouded mind. You're just not getting it.  And that is funny to me.  Minorities are generally poorer and have worse credit. Ok but how do you explain the status quo then? Is it difficult for other lenders to lend to minorities or something? How do you explain the status quo? Redlining and mortgage discrimination still happen. Redlining and mortgage discrimination still happen. So regulation intended to address the issue is not effective? That not only implies regulation is necessary, but that there is an issue in the first place.    ",

    "snippet" : "What is a state? Is it not simply an entity operating under complete freedom?\n\nThe way I see it? Until the human race approaches a near Post-Scarcity, one can argue that you could never get rid of the states, for even if you dismantle the the existing ones, new states would almost immediately pop up and take their place. The states came about because there was a market for them, because there was profit in its existence, easily quantifiable or not. I believe to this day there still is a market for it, however, do I believe that that market has shrunk considerable since many state's inductions? Very much so I do, I believe there has been a very considerable amount of technological progress that has allowed the private to be self-sufficient without necessitating the state to control it. However, I do not believe that EVERY sector has had enough technological progress to reach that point yet. Sectors like Rights Enforcement, the Judicial System and the proper facilitation of maximizing positive externalities (education and its effect on crime rate) of a market and minimizing negative externalities (pollution and its effect on society) since there are still many areas where transaction costs are still relatively high and the Coase theorem breaks down.\n\nSo I have to ask, what are your thoughts on this? Give me criticism and tell me where I am wrong and why with your own beliefs. I do believe that a true stateless world can exist, but it would require us to be sufficiently advanced as to be comparable to at least near/imminent Post-Scarcity (which thinking about it, really begins to defeat the purpose of an economy in the first place).\n\n**Edit**: Also, I am sorry if my title sounds full of myself, it is meant to sound like a legitimate question. I tried to write it better a but it ended up being very bloated. I guess this is what you get for sacrificing clarity for simplicity. Please refer to the little alien that looks happy and genuinely curious next to the title.  In a way, you're definitely correct!  In order for humanity to approach a stateless society, the actual prevailing opinions and beliefs of humanity and civilization as a whole must change.

Religion was the basis of all decision-making, most knowledge, and all rule.  It's only within the last 500 years or so that religion as a ruling power has declined - and it's still not all the way gone.  Belief in government is like that.

The power-elite, who keep their money safely in offshore tax shelters and hop back in forth from various jurisdictions as it suits - are already living the vision, as they are not bound by 'the state'. \n\nThis brings up 2 semi-related points:\n\n* Things won't change until prevailing attitudes change. Its technically incorrect for AnCaps to stage their argument as \"Market vs State\" since in reality the state arose via market demand. However, its rhetorically difficult and complicated to make that argument. Therefore the current rhetoric of \"Market vs State\" is a useful way to help make that attitude change. \n\n* Orthogonal to this, as technology improves we will all be able to \"buy our way out\" of the current state paradigm. As I have long argued, the revolution will happen without anyone ever reading Rothbard, Mises, et al. Such literature is really only of interest to a very very small set of humans who like their philosophy, in the end no one cares. The state will disappear when it becomes possible for the common-joe to jurisdiction hop as easily as the power-elite do now. I think fundamentally a P2P crypto-currency is one of developments which will speed that along.      &gt;What is a state? Is it not simply an entity operating under complete freedom?\n\nIt is not. True freedom exists under the rule of law, which is respecting life, liberty, and property. Everything done against the law is done against freedom.\n\nThere are two definitions that I like to use for the state, one by Bastiat and the other by Rothbard.\n\n\"Government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.\" - Frederic Bastiat, [Government](http://bastiat.org/en/government.html)\n\n\"Briefly, the State is that organization in society which attempts to maintain a monopoly of the use of force and violence in a given territorial area; in particular, it is the only organization in society that obtains its revenue not by voluntary contribution or payment for services rendered but by coercion. While other individuals or institutions obtain their income by production of goods and services and by the peaceful and voluntary sale of these goods and services to others, the State obtains its revenue by the use of compulsion; that is, by the use and the threat of the jailhouse and the bayonet. Having used force and violence to obtain its revenue, the State generally goes on to regulate and dictate the other actions of its individual subjects.\" - Murray Rothbard, [Anatomy of the State](http://library.mises.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/Anatomy%20of%20the%20State.pdf)\n\nAnatomy of the State will make the true nature of government more clear than any other essay I know, so if you really want to know, I highly recommend it.\n\n&gt;I do believe that a true stateless world can exist, but it would require us to be sufficiently advanced as to be comparable to at least near/imminent Post-Scarcity (which thinking about it, really begins to defeat the purpose of an economy in the first place).\n\nI'd disagree as well. Security is obviously a needed service that most people think needs to be provided by a monopoly or else you will inevitably break out into war. This is the justification as to why we need government in our modern society. But I believe this is demonstrably false by the fact that our world does *not* have a single provider of security. The world is divided up into many states and many countries, and people under one provider still hope to be protected by providers from their neighboring countries. But these countries do not break into war whenever there is a dispute between them, nor do they turn to some kind of super-state to settle the issue as a \"supreme authority\". Instead, they solve their differences peacefully and agree on arbitration and laws between them.\n\nIf the US and Canada can stand next to each other under different DROs, then why not break that down to different states, or different cities, counties, neighborhoods, households, or each and every single person?\n\nNo, anarchy is entirely possible now. We just need to do our best to move towards it. &gt; It is not. True freedom exists under the rule of law, which is respecting life, liberty, and property. Everything done against the law is done against freedom.\n\nNo. What is legal and what is moral (for or against \"freedom\", as you put it) are two different things.      Every state in the world has a pact with every other state to uphold the monopoly of justice in their own lands, thus not to compete in producing justice, and to prevent threats against the pact from emerging (so called \"failed states\"). That's actually false. There are many instances where outside States influence or directly run the justice systems in other States. For instance, the US and Iraq. That's actually false. There are many instances where outside States influence or directly run the justice systems in other States. For instance, the US and Iraq.         This is why Nozick argues for (what Rothbard later termed) the immaculate conception of the state, i.e. states will always form out of anarchy.\n\nI also wonder how states formed a cartel. It is an observed fact that states exist and that humankind was in a (somewhat) state of anarchy before the states formed. I've heard people compare the \"pre-state\" times of human history as something other than anarchy. The thinking goes that most people believe states have a sort of \"acceptable\" violence because of various reasons (the state is elected, the state is imprisoning criminals, the state is fighting enemy nations, etc.). As history goes on, what is accepted as legitimate violence is shrinking. Hundreds of years ago it might be perfectly \"acceptable\" to attack a neighboring nation to conquer land or resources, whereas today in the developed world governments must come up with an excuse (terrorism, etc.) in order to make their violence \"acceptable.\"\n\nIn the time before governments, everyone was their own \"state.\" All violence was viewed as \"acceptable.\" Entering your neighbor's mud-hut and killing him for food was considered a legitimate cause for aggression. So you can see there's a difference between the anarchy we discuss today (with no tolerance for aggression) and the \"anarchy\" of prehistoric humans. ",

The drug war took a long time to escalate. At no point have a majority of people been in favor of ending it. In fact increases in the severity of the drug war have always been popular. \n\nI mean even now MJ legalization is opposed by a majority. Until 4 years ago there were no states where MJ legalization was favored by a majority. Within 4 years of there being states where it was supported it was legal in multiple states.

Are you arguing that the king had a social contract with his subjects? And that they had no legal recourse if he breached his side of it?

If you want to attack the social contract, you need to go back further than the constitution. Like to the native americans.   I have an objection to your usage of the word \"regulate\" as it was intended within the constitution.  The word was used in a similar way to how it was used in the 2nd Amendment with regards to militias.  That is, it's saying that the government has a responsibility to ensure that the value of money remains stable and likewise that militias be encouraged and even armed by the government in order for militiamen to know how to protect themselves from tyranny.  \n\nAlso, the ability to borrow was one of the original compromises made.  Thomas Jefferson, for example, thought we should explicitly outlaw borrowing because he understood what it would lead to.  Ultimately this provision was added because of the efforts of Alexander Hamilton, who we all know now was essentially a shill for European financial interests.  \n\nThat being said, I agree that I didn't agree to it and that it shouldn't apply to me anymore.  However, I do still worry about it being abolished tomorrow by someone like Obama.  Not that he obeys it but he does at least maintain the illusion of obeying it for the most part.    I think what he is arguing is silly.  If our government actually followed the constitution we would be much closer to voluntarism that we are to the current government.

People have been trying to do that since the inception of the constitution but since it's adoption it has failed. Allen and sedition acts, the whiskey rebellion, relocation and killing of Indians, civil war, all the other wars of aggression, 16th and 17th amendment, the Fed, irs, war on drugs, home land security, the list could go on and on with failures of how our \"representatives\" did not follow the constitution. Honestly, I don't know how we could ever have something close to ancap.  We started out as an anarchy and then we gave away all our rights to the government as time went on.  If we started over I think that would just happen again given enough time, either through a government or a corporation that will have monopoly on power over others. The U.S. was never an anarchy.

I don't think you have a correct definition of liberty. &gt; So if I hate guns then my freedom is limited by the second amendment? \n\ncorrect to a degree. the difference here is that the 2nd amendment restricts government alone, but a gay marriage law restricts private citizens. therefore if you hate guns, you can still ban guns from your property. If you hate gays, you're **not** allowed to ban them from your property.\n\n&gt;  If I hate free speech my liberty is limited by the first amendment?\n\nSame thing as above. amendments restrict government, not private individuals. For example, you can be banned from reddit for expressing your free speech, but it's not a violation of the 1st amendment.\n\n&gt; I don't think you have a correct definition of liberty.\n\nhopefully you can see the difference now.

They have increased liberty; being barred from doing something and now allowed to do something. \n\n* Also, I'm having trouble understanding your assertion that a law allowing homosexual marriage somehow infringes on the liberty of people who don't approve of homosexuality. The people who don't like gay marriage aren't forced to enter a gay marriage. How does, as you state, \"a gay marriage law restrict private citizens? People opposed to gay marriage still have the freedoms they had before, nothing has changed. Can you explain how recognizing gay marriage infringes on others liberty? I just don't follow the reasoning.  I don't think you're factoring in what rights exist for married couples. This is not just about allowing a marriage license to be issued by government, but also about existing marriage rights. Do you recognize that straight married couples have certain rights that are imposed on \"private citizens\"?\n\n&gt;  Can you explain how recognizing gay marriage infringes on others liberty? I just don't follow the reasoning\n\nOk, lets say you are renting an apartment and you hate gay people. A gay marriage law would not allow you to discriminate based on this point. What obligations are imposed by marriage statutes? Things like hospital visitation rights? For your housing example The Fair Housing Act does not cover sexual orientation. \n\nBy your logic allowing hetero marriages ( inter racial [or religion] marriage may be the best example ) infringes on others liberty. If I don't like a jewish girl marrying a black male then my liberty is infringed if I cannot bar one of them from visiting their significant other in the hospital that I own....? This is a very one-sided construction of liberty. How do you so easily discount the liberty (or lack thereof) of two consenting adults not being allowed to marry? We should refer to what this really is, a simple expansion of the right to contract. It's extremely marginal, but more liberty is always superior to less.  I disagree. I'm sure contracts were allowed previously. I believe this is more about imposing contractual expectations over all contracts across the country.\n\nFor example, an insurance company could have voluntarily recognized gay partners previously. Now though, it must be recognized, thus reducing the freedom of business owners. It's a form of a tax, where one person sacrifices for the benefit of another.\n\nFreedom is reduced. Where previously there were pro-gay and anti-gay contracts, now only pro-gay contracts are allowed. Clearly I believe private businesses should have the right to choose how they do business, but I'm under the assumption that spousal and parental are expanded. \n\nCan two indivdiuals even adopt a child, with full and equal custody, if they are not married? I'll admit some lack of knowledge regarding homosexual marriage, and I am a little biased on the subject.  &gt; Can two indivdiuals even adopt a child, with full and equal custody, if they are not married?\n\nI don't know the answer to this either, but I would assume that they would be treated as common law marriage.\n\nThe point of gay marriage isn't simply about what happens when a dispute goes before a government court. It's also what happens when a gay couple would want to rent an apartment together, get insurance together or any number of interactions with private people. \n\nTherefore this issue is no different than minimum wage laws. Does minimum wage laws increase peoples freedom? Businesses should be permitted to discriminate in any manner they see fit, but that is a separate issue.   Incestuous and polygamous marriages need to be legalized.   This is not a victory for freedom. Just the state picking and choosing which voting blocks to hand out favors to, like it always does. Not mutually exclusive      I'd kind of prefer if they didn't legalize it. The more oppressive the state, the more likely it is to be overthrown. I'd kind of prefer if they didn't legalize it.

    "snippet" : "  Here in Seattle the plastic bag ban is going great!\n\n - [Exhibit 1](http://i.imgur.com/V7UvQ.jpg) (Why bag a single orange???)\n - [Exhibit 2](http://i.imgur.com/s1UrjiH.jpg) (Note the little box of \"cubans\" in the corner)\n\nAnd yes, they banned plastic bags in retail.

They force the store to charge 5 cents.\n\nNow I get paper bags instead of plastic ones. Which take way, way, way more energy to produce. The liberals like to live as if resources are infinite (while paying lip service to environmentalism), so I guess this is a win for them? Don't you know, more laws make us safer and protect the planet?  Just having them written down makes us better people!  Horray!   Yeah, I know. I have to be constantly told not to rape, lest I forget and start a'rapin'. The penis makes me do it. &gt;The penis makes me do it.\n\nThat's a bit too close to being personally responsible for your actions for most people to be comfortable with.  Instead you mean the lack of laws makes you do it, or perhaps the much more nebulous claim of society making you do it.  Remember you are also a victim. If you're a man, you're evil by nature. Law and society keep that evil nature in check. The more laws the better, obviously.\n\nIf you're a woman, you're born angelic. Anything that happens to you you have no control over. You are a perpetual victim. Anything bad you do is the influence of society. Or it's self defense.

What I find most interesting is why these bans get enacted in the first place. My preliminary guess is that there are two factors:\n\n1. Some people strongly want to feel like they're doing good and feel morally superior to the masses.\n\n2. Some lobby group stands to profit from these bans.\n\n\nThoughts?

So someone takes a shit next to a reusable grocery bag and then gets sick and it's the law's fault?    I like the theme of unintended consequences, but this is a pretty silly example. \"banning disposable bags is disgusting, because it inspires people to reuse fiber bags, which *can harbor germs if left unwashed!*\"\n 46 people dying because unwashed bags spread disease is not a silly example. It's silly because anything can become dirty if unwashed. Government is not to blame for bad hygiene. In this case government banned the 100% hygienic plastic bags that didn't need to be washed. It's silly because anything can become dirty if unwashed. Government is not to blame for bad hygiene. It's silly because anything can become dirty if unwashed.

    "title" : "Has that askreddit thread about new technologies got anyone else thinking!",
    "snippet" : "A lot of the answers over there are about how scary the state will be with new technologies being developed. It got me thinking that with every new technological step that helps state surveillance more and more people will become opposed to the state in general. What do you guys think?  I don't disagree. But:\n\nI don't think its the increase in technology itself. It's an increase in *awareness* of the fact that the governments are doing these things. The more they do, the more likely someone is to find out about it, no matter how \"secret\" it is. Fundamentally, its still *people* doing this. The more they do to keep track, the more people they have to hire, thus a greater likelihood there'll be whistleblowers. More people = greater chance that even one gets fed up with the bullshit. Unless they can keep them *all* silent. Which, I suppose, is possible.... :/\n\nIDK, I hope people realize what's going on, but the endless hordes of people that allow shows like Jersey Shore (and all the other reality bullshit) to exist, and to be profitable, just does not look good...  As technology becomes more powerful for surveillance, it also becomes more powerful for privacy. Still, go read the \"France kicks radical muslims out\", and see the same people demanding limits on free speech. I don't doubt the ultimate ability of people to capitulate to the state. Even if they clamor for \"omg dont read my text messages!\" I was thinking maybe the people who are afraid of increased state surveillance are the same people whose parents were afraid of increased state surveillance as it stands today. What I mean is these people's kids might be used to the increased surveillance that these people are afraid of. Maybe the old adage about young people being liberal and older people being conservative will always hold true and their kids will be liberal until they grow up. I use conservative to mean more wary of government though I know that's not really true.\n\nI guess ultimately my hope is that the free market will continue to advance faster than the state can keep up and it will be rendered obsolete (not that it isn't already).  To your latter point: that would be excellent, and ultimately what I think will happen. The state simply becomes irrelevant. \n\nAs to your former point: keep in mind all these younger kids are educated in government schools. I think younger people definitely have the propensity to be more revolutionary/rebellious, but just looking at OWS last year...it was mainly \"we want free stuff!\". There's too much cognitive dissonance there, even if one main concern is freedom from surveillance. \n\nHopefully, like you said, none of this will matter as technology becomes so advanced none of this matters.   Where's the link to it? http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17yf95/which_impending_technologies_are_you_not_looking/ Thanks! Interesting. Hopefully, technology empowers more and more people to question their government.",
