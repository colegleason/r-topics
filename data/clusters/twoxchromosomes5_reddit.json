    "title" : "via /r/ShitCosmoSays: Shockingly Stupid Advice: How Cosmopolitan Magazine is misleading a generation of young women",
    "snippet" : "  I recently moved to Northern Ireland and I was really, really surprised to see the differences between the US Cosmo and the UK Cosmo - I don't have a US Cosmo with me for comparison, but here's the front page of my UK Cosmo:\n\n* Fresh fashion - get ready to wow the world this spring\n* Love your self - feeling like you need to shake your life up? Read this first\n* I put on 3 stone to marry the man I love - the ultimatum that helped Kate Sepkes beat anorexia\n* Smart ways to make your money go twice as far\n* Happy hair - eight new products that'll change your life\n* Mollie from The Saturdays - single, sorted, &amp; storming America\n* Love your body (and his) - we've discovered the secret of great sex (okay, it *is* Cosmo)\n\nWhile you've got your obligatory \"manthropology\" (men decoded) and \"what men think\" sections of the magazine, you've also got an interview with Mollie from the Saturdays (whatever that band is) subtitled *loving the single life.* Sure, there's the obligatory \"what's sexy now\" in the world of fashion, you've also an article that asks if you're your SO's best friend or just his surrogate mother - subtitled \"is it time to stop picking up his dirty towels?\" And even though there *is* an article about great sex, it's not advising young girls to have sex in 93 different positions and a jar of peanut butter.\n\nThe US Cosmo, which my best friend and I used to read late at night with pints of ice cream, she in a long distance relationship going nowhere and me perpetually single, tells its readers that their self worth can be measured in their sex appeal.  We knew that the sex tips that Cosmo offered were written by some nameless intern struggling to come up with 300 hot kinky sex tips, and we read them aloud to laugh at a magazine that seemed to take itself so seriously - but that doesn't dilute the fact that the US Cosmo is yet more media telling us that if we're single, we ought to do something to change that.  Rather, we ought to change ourselves: dress a certain way, tilt our heads to one angle or the other, hope that some guy notices our advances and tells us, yes, we're worth it, and hands us the jar of peanut butter.\n\nWhat I find noticeable about the UK Cosmo, then, is that it doesn't pander to this kind of culture, at all. I found it enjoyable to read, actually, although I'd bought it so my friend and I could laugh at it over Skype. I found the stories relevant! Useful! Reading about a celebrity who loves being single! Reading articles that tell me how to get out of my rut - without attracting a man! An interview with the 32 year old female director of a football league! I'm not saying that the UK Cosmo is a bastion of feminism or positive gender roles, but I was really, truly shocked at how different it was from the US Cosmo. And in fact, I was sort of offended: offended that the higher-ups at Cosmo decided that American women weren't worth being treated as adults.  Instead, we're worth being treated as girls desperate for sex tips, reading women's magazines because we don't know how to be sexy or confident, because we need someone to tell us, like *so much of the media* surrounding women today. The UK Cosmo assumes that you are confident and helps you along; the US Cosmo tears down your confidence and then keeps you reading by telling you how you might get it back. Isn't that what most of our culture does anyways?  ",

    "snippet" : "After watching the vagina monologues, it made me think of how rarely we are asked about our vagina's. Guys talk about their wang's quite a bit so why not us?\n\nLadies of 2x I ask you, how is your vagina?\nAre you happy with it? \nIf it could speak what would it say?\nHow does it feel? Happy, sad, content?\n\nEdit: Wow I honestly can't believe the amounts of comments i'm getting! I thought for sure it would be only a few of you. HOWEVER! As a challenge to all of you, I dare you to look at your vagina in a mirror tonight and think about two compliments you can give to her!\n\nEdit 2: Okay! It seems a conversation got started in /r/askmen which is \"how is your penis\" here it is:http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/19132n/hows_your_penis/  its a nice contrast to see how the genders view themselves.\n  My vagina is stinky, and I'm embarrassed by the smell. I work in a hot environment, so it sweats, it's constantly warm, and just plain stinky. I avoid sitting down in closed spaces because I'm terrified that my peers will notice. It's like stinky balls, but worse, because I can't just apply baby powder or goldbond to it to make it smell better. \n\nUgh.  Try feminine wipes.  Carry a few in your briefcase , pocket, or whatever you carry around with you.   My vagina is stinky, and I'm embarrassed by the smell.

It's like stinky balls, but worse, because I can't just apply baby powder or goldbond to it to make it smell better. \n\nUgh.  There needs to be a vagina deodorant. During my period sometimes it gets really sweaty and gross. Just the most uncomfortable feeling ever. However there are always those wipes you can freshen up with. There totally is.  The kind I use is made by Summer's Eve, I believe.  It comes in a little metal can and you spray your lady bits after the shower (or whenever, I suppose).  I think it works well, but I don't suffer from a strong odor - I bought it for my roommate to try and she didn't take the hint. v.v Really? I had no clue. I get the stinky smell every so often. It's horrid like a stinky taco (literally). Hell I don't even want to go down there and check things out. Aw, lol.  My condolences.  You should check it out, it's usually with the other lady products in most stores.  If you're *really* strong smelling you might want to see your doctor.. could be something strange afoot in there.

She's doing fantastic this morning and she thanks you for asking! \n\nI'm happy with my vagina. Never really felt a reason to be insecure about it. \n\nI think she's a pretty happy vagina - has a wonderful penis that visits her often, I think they're getting along great and things are probably getting serious for the two of them. \n\nIf she could speak she would probably say \"Soap tastes gross - be careful not to get any in my mouth when you're showering, ok? Also, thanks for the haircut!\" Your vagina sounds like a classy lass.  My vagina: \"Feeeeeeed me.\"  She's bleeding continuously for the last two weeks (which makes 4 weeks out of the last 7), and is starting to resent me for putting a stupid implanon rod in my arm. Sadly the pill made me really anxious and I'm too afraid to go back, and fed up of this crap. SO I don't really know what to do about it. Also may be becoming anaemic. Awesome-sauce. \n\nPlus she's lonely because she can't visit with her favourite penis thanks to all the endless bleeding.

True, she is getting saggy along with the rest of me.  Her complexion is darker than when she first looked in the mirror, less pink, more brown.  Her hair is changing texture and thinning, and now she's getting odd whiteheads.  That's just weird, nothing unusual or worrisome.\nShe gets plenty of loving visits from The Little Guy (who is not little at all), and even though she needs a bit more help with personal lubricants these days, she has a vigorous workout routine.  \nPoor darling needs to convince the ovaries it is far past time for menopause.  We'd be quite happy about that. &gt;Poor darling needs to convince the ovaries it is far past time for menopause. We'd be quite happy about that.\n\nThis made me smile. I hear so many women talking about menopause as if it's the end of your life, it's nice to hear positive things, or at least someone with a positive outlook.  I have long labia, and until I started posting on reddit, I never felt ashamed about that. Then I realized that a lot of guys seem to prefer ladybits with no lips... and now I feel all weird. Also, I am Indian so my goods are not pink... They are a purple-ish brown and that makes me feel weird too. I am just all kinds of sensitive about her.

I think it would help during these discussions (on other subs talking about ladybits) to know the age and sexual history of the person talking. I think there are a lot of men (and women!) that only know a very limited amount about sex and the small amount they do know they learned through pornography. \n\nThis probably leads to some interesting first time experiences. I shutter to think of the poor women that end up with some of the fools going around talking about \"beef curtains\". You just know when you're reading those comments that they haven't seen a real vagina since they were coming out of their mother's.\n\nI mean, labia come in all shapes! The only way it's wrong is if it's causing you pain or discomfort. I would never stop a man I was interested in enough to be butt naked in bed with and say *Nope! Those balls aren't the perfect specimens I was expecting...Get out!* I know reddit is very pro porn, and I think it can be fun on occasion but it really does a number on the male brain. My ex fiancé is a good example of this. He has conditioned his brain into thinking that only tiny, petite women are attractive. He was never able to have a sexual appetite for me (5'6, 150#, size 8) because of this. He also thought my vag was weird because I have 'lips'. For reference, I am 25 and we started dating when I was 23 and he was 27.  Wow, that's crazy. Did he say you had a weird vagina? That had to be a fun conversation. I'm sorry you were treated so badly, but thank goodness  he's your ex.\n\nThere should be a website filled with pictures of real vaginas so we can point these clueless men there whenever they say something so ignorant.

A month ago I ended up in the ER with a UTI that spread to my kidneys. Extreme chills, nausea, back pain - the whole works! The antibiotics gave me a yeast infection, of course. And then last weekend I ended up in urgent care with *another* UTI. And I just got a phone call that my urinalysis came in and this infection is resistant to the antibiotics I was prescribed! Fantastic!! :( :( Omg I hope you get better soon! Right now it is very unhappy. A month ago I ended up in the ER with a UTI that spread to my kidneys.

Here's to hoping my vadge starts behaving itself soon! :D Good luck!!! Kidney stuff is no fun! :(  I just want to point out that I rarely, if ever, talk about my penis with anyone.  I know of no one who \"talks about their wang quite a bit\".\n\nHe's doing fine though. Yeah, I rarely hear guys talking about their penis. Or hear OF them talking about their penis. I mean, it's not like much changes. \n\n\"So, SighJay, how's your penis?\" \n\n\"Eh, you know. Still hanging. Sometimes it stands up. It does it's normal biological function.\"\n\n\"Yeah, me too. Welp, let's do this again next week! Same time?\" I'd say it has much less to do with consistency and more to do with uncomfort on all sides.  Guys are universally scared of their dick not \"measuring up\" and if they're confident in their dicks, it would be like saying you make so much money, to your poor friends. Only we generally have no understanding of eachother's penises and therefore have no understanding of where we fall in comparison. Better to not mention it. Such a shame that size is a fear. I know I've had discussions with my friends about the size of our vaginas. Which is a fucking odd conversation to have, but no shame involved. \n\nI just read an interesting article about the WeVibe - apparently it's really helpful if you *do* have a partner on the small side. If only guys talked about their penises more, they could share that information with their buddies. In like a THE MORE YOU KNOW kinda way... Now you got me curious.  Why is it better to be on the smaller side?   I never said one size or another is better. How is it helpful then?  If possible I would be very interested in the article.  Oooh you mean for the WeVibe. It doesn't help to be small, it helps you if you are small. Or if your girlfriends gspot is further back or higher than you can reach. It does the gspot stimulating for you. Now you got me curious.  Why is it better to be on the smaller side?   I just want to point out that I rarely, if ever, talk about my penis with anyone.

I know of no one who \"talks about their wang quite a bit\".\n\nHe's doing fine though. I guess it depends of what sort of social environments you are exposed to. \n\nHere's an example to make it more clear, my sibling works at a train yard and the guys talk about their penises on a daily basis. It is not a professional atmosphere. Hmmm.  I'd go out on a limb and say they talk about dicks in an abstract sense, but never touch on anything to do with their actual dick.  It's easy to picture them saying things like \"that chick gets my dick hard\" or \"let's get our dicks wet!\" but not \"well, mine curves to the left a little.\". The most I remember talking about my actual penis to other guys is in eighth grade when a friend mentioned how odd it would be to be uncut and we all revealed our circumcision status. It was awkward even lightly breached. There is so much masculine doubt and worry wrapped up in our dicks, and if they're bigger/smaller, or better/worse than they should be that it's orders of magnitude more awkward to bring up than politics or religion.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry for my original comment, I hate seeing it at the top of this lovely vagina thread.  I should have kept my mouth shut and my cock out of things, as usual. :(   I'm 18 weeks pregnant so my vagina is going through some changes.  It has a weird onion/garlic smell I'm not crazy about. And as of this morning I think she might be getting an overgrowth of some yeasties.  So far she is not particularly enjoying pregnancy. I'm 18 weeks pregnant so my vagina is going through some changes.  It has a weird onion/garlic smell I'm not crazy about. And as of this morning I think she might be getting an overgrowth of some yeasties.  So far she is not particularly enjoying pregnancy.  Pretty good, though she's a little worried that she bleeds after being fingered and kindly asks me to tell my SO to cut his fingernails.  Eeep! You'd think with how all guys seem to know sharp fingernails and handjobs are just about the worst thing ever, more men would take their own fingernails into account.  Hand that man a nail file ASAP! I feel like my cervix might just be delicate... because I've done it to myself with my nails short. Which scares me- I intend to get it checked out at the end of next month.  my vagina had sex last night :) [Relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o)   If my vagina had a voice she would be crying in a dark musty corner of a dark musty room - she feels unheard, and it's hurting her. If she could speak she would say to him, \"What have you done to me?\" She is the saddest thing I have seen in a long time, and I want to help but I'm in the opposite corner of the self-same dark musty room, and my hands are tied, though that's partially of my own doing.      \nShe hasn't been treated with the tenderness she deserves and it's tearing me apart. I want to reach out and hold her, brush the tangled hair and dry the tear-stained eyes, but I don't know how.\n\n...\n\n-----\nAaaand posting, before I turn into a coward and can't. GIVE HER ATTENTION! Right now!  She's had attention. That's not the problem. It's the *wrong kind* of attention. That's why she's sad. Just remember that wrong attention is **not her fault**.\n\nI'm glad you still have the want to fix her. Please please please talk to someone (whether it's a professional or not) you feel comfortable with. If you don't have anyone in mind, feel free to message me.\n\nVaginas are beautiful and sacred and deserve all the best love and treatment, which can be a very difficult relationship to start. I wish you lots of luck, sister.  Ollie is incredibly satisfied on a constant basis. She's constantly putting me in a good mood even on terrible days. I'm really grateful she's around to help keep my head up. \n\n\nShe also really really enjoys the fact that my SO and his, Andrew and Granpappy (long story) respectively, love her even during sharkweek. Ollie and Granpappy are quite the happy couple. I don't think we've ever been so totally and completely satisfied on every level. \n\n\nAll in all, she's pretty damn happy.  This made me smile... and I'd like to assume my vagina is as well.  She is doing well... not happy with shark week looming, but all in all, happy! How is Shark Week relevant?    o_0\n\nEDIT:  *I am a fucking idiot.  Thank you.* Shark Week means your period  How is Shark Week relevant?    o_0\n\nEDIT:  *I am a fucking idiot.  Thank you.*  Hahaha, this question made my morning. \n\nJust got over my first UTI so all is well again.

Do not get discouraged!  No regrets or second thoughts at all.  I know i did the right thing.  But the vag is feeling a little disturbed by the process.  I'm sure that'll get better with time.\n\nBTW i really enjoy this post.  Thanks for prompting a vagina discussion! she is sad and very unhappy with the number of foreign objects/medical instruments that have been inside her this week (had an abortion). she is worried that she is ruined and that no one will find her appealing any more if know about what happened :(    I'm bi, currently have a wonderful (female) partner and sometimes I really miss penises. That doesnt mean that I'd ever cheat on my partner or that our sex is bed, but sex with a woman just feels so much different than sex with a man. Unfortunately dildos, no matter how realistic, don't do it for me. I hear that. I am also bisexual and find it hard to deal with that even though you're with someone who you like or even possibly love there's always that underlying erge to have something else fulfilled like the same or opposite sex.

However it was nearly a year since she had any visits from anyone. Until the beginning of the month where she was caught up in the moment of her owner being drunk. Sadly she didn't get wet at all because her owner was quite dehydrated from the booze. However her owner is now seeing this guy and now she's expecting more visits. She thinks about him a lot now. At the moment though shes just getting over the monthly gift and happy that the birth control shes taking is making her less bloody during that time. Also, she just got shaved and there are a ridiculous amount of ingrown hairs making her appearance not so appealing. All in all, shes content. Hey, you sparked a great thread! These responses are fantastic. And I was just about to ask the same to you OP :) thanks for sharing. \n\nBest of luck with the new man Sheutz. Live long and prosper! Aww well thank you! How is your penis there? Hm? Recovering for a horrendous waxing I got while intoxicated. \n\nBut all in all, I've got such a supportive and understanding partner, so most days my lil' guy feels like a prince. \n\nChrist, don't wanna sell myself short! It's average. All average. Disappointingly average...   I guess I'd consider myself fortunate. It's doing well and my SO seems to find her very attractive. He said it's pretty so all in all, can't complain.        It sounds like every female Redditor's vagina gets stuffed a lot, has a UTI, and is in a constant state of bleeding. \n\nYikes.  Little Daisy is satisfied by her beautiful girlfriend on a regular basis, and whether fingers or a strap on, she comes quite easily.  However, she is frustrated that every time she shaves she gets fairly bad razor burn which sometimes turns into ingrown hairs.  It constantly looks like a minefield down there!  All in all, she's happy with how she looks and acts and feels and tastes.

It's about the size of a champagne grape at the moment but in the past it's gotten as large as a regular grape.  This is the third time.  I'm putting off going to the doctor, because it's going to be a really unpleasant visit.  My boyfriend and I's sex life has been strained lately, this just adds one more thing to deal with.

I hope things get better that must be rough :(  My vagina feels lonely and neglected, honestly.  I've never really been a fan of taking care of my sexual urges with her and much prefer someone else to take care of them (that sounds entitled and selfish, doesn't it?) for me.  I haven't been laid since late December.  I did have a sexting session a few weeks ago that really got me riled up, but nothing since.  She wants me to get back with my husband and resume mind-blowing sex but that's a long process (we're legally separated and a couple hours away from each other, although that might change soon).  I think I should take control of things and give her the love she needs.  I'm like a camel sometimes and can go without an orgasm with no real trouble or distress.  I think I bottle up my sex drive though. if you're uncomfortable with doing it yourself, i suggest trying with a shower head.  extremely enjoying, not exaaaactly like doing it yourself.  that's how i got started lol\n\ngo have some fun! It's silly for me to say this because I do have a perfectly applicable dildo that I love but it's almost like my sex drive is on the back burner because I always feel like I have so much going on otherwise.  When I go for it, I'm definitely satisfied but it almost feels like a chore or a luxury that I don't deserve (self esteem and confidence issues). :(  that's a shame!  maybe just stick to the joy of eating chocolate lol  yeast infection :(\n\nSeriously though, between bartholin's cysts, yeast infections, utis, BC, and menstruation, my vagina is beginning to feel a little high maintenance.  I JUST got rid of a bartholin's cyst only to get a yeast infection a week later.     My vagina often smells kind of fishy to me, which worries me, because I keep reading that it's not supposed to smell like that. However, my boyfriend almost always goes down on me as long as it's clean and shaved, so maybe it's not as bad as I think. Also, one of my labia sticks out more than the other. He thinks it's cute.

XD My labia are the same!   I thought I was the only one.   Munhusband says it looks like she's smiling at him.     Not doing well at all, on my period, tried to use a tampon again for the third time and it hurt like crazy. :/ They shouldn't hurt at all... What kind are you using? I tried a really small one I'm not sure which brand, but it just hurt so much that I couldn't even get it in half way. Honestly go see your doctor. A tampon should be going in really easily. I cant imagine that sex would be pleasant either. That's exactly what I'm worried about too. But I did some more research today and found out about the different types of hymen and everything. And I don't really feel that comfortable asking my mom to go see a doctor about this because she's never bothered to tell me anything, she just gave me pads and some Ibuprofen. You can always make your own doctor appointments if you feel the need for it to be more confidential. However talking to your mom about this may be beneficial because what if this is a genetic thing? You may find out a lot. Also, she could be really afraid or even nervous to talk to you about it. So talking about it first may just break the ice.  I'm not old enough to make my own appointments. I know this isn't genetic, she told me when I had my surgery a few years ago, but I think I'm also afraid of her reaction. She might just say something like why do you need tampons and then just brush it off. I hate to ask, but are you a virgin? If so it could be your hymen hasn't ripped or stretched enough yet. Honestly try masturbating more just to get yourself used to it. Masturbation will stretch it or even potentially rip it.  It's ok, I am. And I tried to finger myself a little and it just felt so bad. It felt like stretching skin so much it would burn. I could feel a tiny little opening but that's about it.    Right now it's a bit sore because i lost my virginity last night, but otherwise gooood, thanks for asking!\n\n[Yay!](http://i.imgur.com/QBsZX9w.png) Congrats on the sex! X3 ",

    "snippet" : "Has anyone else noticed the recent ads for vagina cleansing washes? Like those \"hail to the v\" or vagisil wash commercials? Well i think they are BULLSHIT and i got to get this off my chest. \nFirst of all, to retain proper pH balance in your vag doctors recommend washing it with.. wait for it... WATER or a very mild soap. So that means these companies are literally just trying to sell you watery soap!! I feel like they are telling women that their vaginas are somehow \"unclean\" so they can sell them bogus products that they don't need!!!  If your pH balance is actually messed up then you need to go to a motherfucking doctor, not use stupid soap! You know why women have never used these kinds of products before? Because they're motherfucking bullshit.\nSorry for my language but this pisses me off like crazy. I hate that companies are playing off women's insecurities to make money. I hope no women fall for this. \nBe proud of your Vagina! Its not dirty or gross and don't let anyone tell you that!   I feel like there's a semantics issue here at play that's causing a bit of confusion.   Many women in here are saying they use vaginal soaps when in fact they are using them to clean their vulva, which is external, not the actual internal vagina.  And although it may not be the best thing to use a scented soap on your vulva it's not nearly as bad as using it on the inside of your vagina. Outside: mild soap and water\n\nInside: nothing. Although occasionally douching with just water if you feel really insecure about it or if a doctor says to won't hurt.  \"Outside: mild soap and water\"\n\nBut that's what the Vagisil soap _is_.  A mild soap.  Not as mild as it should be (the sensitive version still has dyes and fragrance) but better than the Enchanted Vanilla Tangerine Forest body wash that one might otherwise use.

My aunt, who is one of my best friends, INSISTS on using a \"Feminine Deodorant Spray\", and I've been telling her for yeeeears that a vagina is NOT supposed to smell like \"Summer Rain.\"  Every time we go shopping and she puts it in the cart, I'm just like, \"NO!\"  But, alas, I have not won the battle.  I also don't understand scented tampons and pads...ummm...no thanks.   You spray that on the outside. It's a fine powder - antiperspirant for the areas covered by your underwear. You don't stick the nozzle up your pussy and spray the inside of your body. If your aunt likes her panties to smell like something other than pussy, what business is it of yours? Wow, that was unnecessarily harsh.  My basic, and rather light-hearted point, was that \"pussy\", as you so eloquently put it, should smell like \"pussy\", and that I think things like FDS are just part of the bigger marketing ploy that the natural smell of a vagina, or vulva, or whatever specific part of the female anatomy, is somehow \"dirty\".  It was just my opinion.  She's not offended, so I'm not quite sure why you seem to be.\n\nEDIT:  No harm, no foul. If there was an equivalent dong spray I would not be quite as incensed.  I could see a market for anti-ball-funk products.  And while there's sensitive skin there, at least there's no mucous membranes, so it would likely be healthier. There is Axe body spray and then there is jock itch type stuff. How do we change the public perception of ball stink to warrant a new product? If labia must smell like a berry patch as the normative, balls must smell like ___ to secure the same.\n If there was an equivalent dong spray I would not be quite as incensed.   Umm, nobody should be washing their vagina, labia yes, vagina no.  \n\n Just shove some soap in it and bounce up and down. BUBBLE MACHINE!  fuck yes. BUBBLE MACHINE!  fuck yes.  Absolutely dumb question... what would be considered a 'mild soap'? I use just a standard dove bar for my body, but i'm nervous to put it near my vag. I was using Ivory at one point.  Any recommendations?  Absolutely dumb question... what would be considered a 'mild soap'? I use just a standard dove bar for my body, but i'm nervous to put it near my vag.

But the vagina is not pH neutral But the vagina is not pH neutral pH neutral means it will neither raise nor lower the pH of your body.  I watched Laci Green's video a while back with regards to cleaning yourself in the shower and all she suggested was your hand and some warm water. It's amazing because I've definitely noticed healthy changes with regards to smell and discharge.  Love Laci Green!  Buzzed through a bunch of her videos a few nights in a row learning about my lady bits.  This is why I like Summer's Eve a lot. It's a really, really mild soap with no fragrances that gently cleans the vaginal area and comes in washes and wipes. They market their products not in a way that makes vaginas seem \"dirty\" but as an alternative for women who can't use fragrances. And the wipes are awesome when during shark week and after sex.\n\nBut I wholeheartedly feel OP's sentiments.   See, I really enjoy the Summer's Eve feminine body wash. Why? Because it doesn't agitate my sun allergy patches on my skin and because I can just do one continuous wash with the loofa and no have to worry about the scent front the soap giving me an infection of one kind or another. \n\nSo while the commercials are dopey, the products are actually really good.  You can buy perfume/irritant free soap that isn't that brand and is probably cheaper. Have you tried other brands and they don't work for you, or you just like that one and stick to it? I suppose I could, but there's something about that light, fresh scent that keeps me coming back. Plus there's the issue with nearly all soaps aggravating my sun allergy. So because of that I stick to what I know. I do have some samples of the poise brand that I want to try out and can give an update on for interested parties.  This seems like an almost unintended side effect of the product.   Riiiiight, but why should that matter?\n\nMy original point was that the product can be used all over without worry that the scent will irritate my bits. \n\nThis seems like you're just finding crap to be mad at.  I'm not mad. I am not the commented you were replying to, just chiming in. I do worry that people will resort to those products to deal with an infection instead of getting medical help.   I have sensitive skin and crazy hives and I would wash with dog shampoo if it made my skin better.  Sorry, I didn't mean you as in you, I meant 'you' as in most of the people in this thread. \n\nIt's lady soap for women who maybe don't have any idea how to take proper care of themselves or maybe don't understand that the vagina is a self-cleaning oven. It's just when I see threads like this all I can think is that people are just finding things to be pissed off at.

Alright, yell at me, hate me whatever. I've seen the \"hail to the V\" ads, and I don't think the message they send is \"eww your lady bits are nasty go wash them!\". To me, it's more \"Woo vaginas are so awesome! Your vagina is so cool that you should pamper it with this special shit because you pamper things that are wonderful!\".  Also, I don't think anybody is actually getting the idea that they are supposed to be putting this product INSIDE OF THEMSELVES. It's just like a body wash.

Because it is.\n\nI figure an unscented wash is just fine, I mean, it's made for my vagina. I'd much rather be using that than scented soap and getting an infection.

AN EXTERNAL BODY WASH specially for your queen V.  I thought the external washes/wipes were a good idea, actually. I sweat a lot during the day, so why shouldn't my vagina have a nice wash, too? I can wash my hands or my face throughout the day, I wouldn't mind keeping the lady parts fresh with a wipe or whatever, as well. Do I want it to smell like a perfumy French hooker? No. But I don't want it to smell like the high tide at the docks, either.  Yeah I've never understood where we're supposed to draw the line to be politically correct. Okay, so I'm not supposed to mind how my vagina smells, but using deodorant is okay because I *am* allowed to be offended by the smell of my sweaty armpits? Vaginas get sweaty too, especially if you have some thick ass thighs like I do and sit most of the day. There's not an overwhelming amount of air flow. \n\nI think I've always had good intuition about my own vagina, but then people started telling me society did that to me. I'm not so sure. Those crystal deodorant bars work great under boobs, butt cracks and ...leg pits?(!) Be careful if you just shaved your bikini line though, ouch! I keep forgetting that I want to try those. Thanks! Will someone tell me what these are? Under boob sweat is the *worst!* I thought the external washes/wipes were a good idea, actually.

Like these ones I'm hearing about making your vagina smell \"sexy\" as if the good old fashioned smell of vagina isn't. But for like, summer's eve and stuff, it always comes off to me as a special soap just for the vag. I know if I put regular bodywash down there it can burn sometimes, so here's a more sensitive soap for the more sensitive parts of your skin. \n\nI use it. Maybe I'm buying in to something stupid, but it doesn't seem to be hurting anything.    Also, you know, the vagina is self-cleaning. So there's that.  Why not? I don't think anyone is suggesting that we put these products *inside* of our bodies in any way. Sometimes things get a little funky down there, especially when it's hot out. What's wrong with washing with a product that cleans and makes it smell nicer? I do wish there were a vag-safe wipe, just for occasions when you can't shower...in case I dunno maybe someone's going to give you a handy later. Would that just be a baby-wipe though? How are those different?

So I'm out there spreading the good word for you! :)   People are out to make money. Of course it's BS, but so is half the stuff that's advertised on TV. Summer's Eve and everything like it is just snake oil. If you want to throw your money into the toilet, so be it.  you are more likely to get a yeast infection after douching or \"washing.\"  The vagina is a self-cleaning organ.  That's the purpose of discharge.  Also, vaginal health is dependent on a balance of endogenous microbiota present.  When you flush out the bacteria, you put yourself at risk for bacterial vaginosis.   yeah... i have never bought them i know some ladies swear by them to prevent UTIs, yeast infections, etc.  Yes, I've heard women swear by lots of things that don't necessarily help them or actually hurt them. If it actually seems to help you and isn't hurting anything, fine, but if you don't have any problems in the first place, it's probably not worth purchasing them.\n\nDid you know women used to spray Lysol up their vaginas to clean them and/or prevent pregnancy? People swear by lots of bad stuff and useless stuff. &gt; Did you know women used to spray Lysol up their vaginas to clean them and/or prevent pregnancy?  \n  \noh goodness gracious... Oh, and the advertisements about how you would \"ruin\" your marriage or be [locked out](http://boingboing.net/2010/07/03/remarkably-frank-lys.html) from sexual encounters with your husband are amazingly bad. Oh, [here's another](http://www.mum.org/Lysol48.htm). If you just Google image search, \"Lysol douche ad,\" you'll get some great hits.  I think I just puked in my mouth.  \n  \nThese are so terrible I don't know if I should laugh at the absurdity or just...aghhh. Yes, I've heard women swear by lots of things that don't necessarily help them or actually hurt them.

People swear by lots of bad stuff and useless stuff. yeah... i have never bought them i know some ladies swear by them to prevent UTIs, yeast infections, etc.  My doctor told me they *cause* yeast infections.  Yeast can multiply any time something throws off the pH balance, and that's exactly what douching does.  I hear you. I've never understood why someone would mess with a self cleaning machine. I recommend getting TiVo. Best thing I've ever done for myself. Never get pissed off at a commercial again. :) You don't wash your vagina (as in go all up in there and wash that). You have to wash the VULVA with mild soap and water. People get so confused about this when they hear \"vaginas are self-cleaning.\" Yes, vaginas are. Not vulvas. You need to wash the outside bits.  Well yeah, I thought that was obvious. I've never actually watched the commercial- I just fast forward. I was assuming by vagina wash you meant something like a douche.  Well the product OP is complaining about isn't douche, it's actually a mild soap meant for the vulva.\n\nAnyway it's good you know. I just wanted to clear it up because I've known a lot of women who seriously thought vulvas were self cleaning, because they didn't know the real meaning of vagina.     &gt; So that means these companies are literally just trying to sell you watery soap!\n\nYeah, companies sell a lot of BS, just because there are people that will buy it. Just look at bottled water in developed countries. I live in the US, and my roommate always has bottled water to take to class even though we have very clean tap water, and filtering pitchers on top of that.\n\nIn the end, if people want to spend their money on these things, I don't really care. People choose to allocate their money differently, as long as they don't force it on me, I don't mind what they do. I had a Vietnamese roommate and he was actually surprised that we used tap water and refused to drink it because he didn't trust it. He looked at use like we were crazy when we got a glass from the tap. :/ Tap water in Vietnam isn't treated and regulated as much as it is in the US and is generally considered unsafe for drinking--you have to either boil it first or drink bottled water.

Some people may really like those products. &gt;Some vaginas are dirty and need to be cleaned... just like any other part of the human body. \n\nRight, so, wouldn't you just use some mild soap and water like OP said?\n\nI think OP is bothered by the fact that by advertising and selling these products, companies are insinuating or flat-out saying that vaginas are dirty and gross, and you need to use special cleaning products to clean them--that's how messed up and gross they are.\n\nHowever, this is how most advertisers advertise any beauty or hygiene or fitness or style product. They insinuate that there's something wrong with the way you look/smell/dress/are. If you just buy their product, you'll finally be attractive and your life will be wonderful! For example, your skin is dull/dry/pimply/red/oily/too dark/too pale--look at how different your skin is compared to all these models'--but if you use our special face soap, it will be glowing and smooth and perfect!\n\nThe fact that these vaginal cleaning products are becoming more common/being advertised more might actually be due to the fact that discussing sex and sex organs, while still taboo, is not considered as horrifyingly inappropriate as it was 30 or 40 years ago. They are saying that you need to clean your vagina, like handsoap commercials or toothpaste commercials. Some vagina owners may like the specials soaps, or are like me and have pH problems out the wazoo. Except those soaps don't fix pH problems. Except those soaps often CAUSE pH problems, UTIs and yeast infections. Some do, not all, but some do. And some people just genuinely like using them, and don't need to be made to feel stupid by people that don't like them. It's the same thing as a shampoo commercial saying their product will wash away the natural oils your hair accumulated. Or a commercial for a foot wash or powder that says it will rid your foot of the odor it naturally lets off.  Except, you don't like this product or use this product. Some people want to use these products to wash their vagainas and vaginal area... so what? It doesn't concern you- you don't use them if you don't want to. Teach your daughter that if she doesn't want to use them, then she doesn't have to. But there isn't anything wrong with it.  Some do, not all, but some do.

You don't put [foreign liquids](http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/douching.cfm) up there (yes, I know that link is about douching but it is 100% relevant). And I quote:\n\n&gt;Most doctors say **it's best to let your vagina clean itself.** The vagina cleans itself naturally by making mucous. The mucous washes away blood, semen, and vaginal discharge. You should know that even healthy, clean vaginas may have a mild odor.\n\n&gt; Keep the outside of your vagina clean and healthy by washing regularly with warm water and mild soap when you bathe. **You should also avoid scented tampons, pads, powders, and sprays. These products may increase your chances of getting a vaginal infection.**\n\nFrom a [doctor's website](http://www.filipinamd.com/2011/11/what-is-the-right-feminine-wash/):\n\n&gt;The external portion of the vagina from the mons pubis (the pubic hair area) down to the anus is generally called the vulva. It is composed of skin with hair follicles. Naturally, this area is prone to sweat, perspiration and discharges from the vagina.\n\n&gt;The normal pH of skin is close to neutral (4.5 – 5.5). **The best and cheapest way to keep the vulva clean is by washing with water** and MOST importantly, keeping the area dry and cool.\n\nSo you know what? You're flat out wrong and you're just making yourself look a fool. Unless you've been told to use a medicinal wash by your doctor for specific issues you have, you're only hurting yourself by introducing foreign liquids to the vagina and vulva.  And mild soap... you mean the soaps these companies are selling? And I'm using 'vagina' to mean the vulva and the whole shebang, btw... not just the actual vagina part. I'm telling you to let the women that use these products to use them and not to call them stupid for liking them. If they use them and it makes them happy, just leave them be. There isn't anything wrong with it, they like it- let them like it. Don't dictate how a woman washes her vagina. You don't use the product, go you! Just let other women.

And as others have already said, douches actually screw up your pH. I only have used a douche once and... never again. Also, I don't have insurance yet, it hasnt been 30 days since starting my new job. So I don't have a doctor.

If that doesn't set you right (which it often doesn't)...that's when most doctor's give up. We're kind of on our own, experimenting with diets, and probiotics to ingest or shove up our vaginas.

    "snippet" : "She won't even listen to me.\n\nMy sister is 17 and recently started being sexual with her boyfriend. They've only fooled around with fingering, bjs... ughh, I don't really want to think about my kid sister getting dirty, hah.\n\nAnyway, I think she's too immature to even be doing this, but whatever.\nShe came to me earlier, freaking out and crying because earlier she and her boyfriend were fooling around and she told me she gave him a hand job, and got some of his ejaculate on her hand. She said a few minutes after they'd finished, she washed her hands and dried them, and even poured freaking HYDROGEN PEROXIDE on her hands. Then, she took a quick shower.\n\nNow, she's totally freaked out that she washed off her boyfriend's semen from her hands and just washed it off in the shower to get all over her...uhh...vagina. She thinks that she washed off, in the shower, the jizz from her hands onto her other body parts, vagina especially.\n\nShe's not an idiot, she's not uneducated in sex, but damn, she has a serious phobia of getting preggers.\n\nShe won't listen to me, so can any of you ladies reassure her? Just comment on how impossible it is for her to get pregnant. She's so freaked out that she accidentally washed off her vagina in the shower with her bare hand(the jizzy hand), and thinks she'll get pregnant.   Haha...oh man. She sounds exactly like I was in high school. I had serious anxiety issues over that. \nYou're right, it's impossible for her to get pregnant from that. The semen would have to resist the water and the peroxide, she'd have to be ovulating at the right time, and the semen would have to travel into her vagina and up her urethra. Some perfectly fertile couples have to try for weeks, months, even years to pregnant by having vaginal sex :)   ",

    "snippet" : "I just had a run in with two guys who stared way too long at me in my opinion. To me I felt creeped out because it felt like they were both objectifying me at the same time. \n\nI find that there's a huge difference between showing interest and showing that you are a potential creeper. When I looked over a second time they didn't even make eye contact- they just continued to stare at my body. There was no hello, no smile, no eye contact, just blatant staring without regard for me as a person. Then they looked at each other and smirked. I was wearing a regular sweatshirt and jeans so was pretty impressed at the ridiculousness of it all.\n\nI was wondering, where is the line between appreciation, flirtation, and creeping? Right now I am feeling pretty violated and it pisses me off because I want to be able to deal with these events without them haunting my day. (It triggers memories from past traumatic events).\n\nI believe the line is specific to each person, but I'd like to hear any ideas and thoughts. It would help me deal with the creepy vibe I can't seem to shake from this morning. Thank you.  That was Twilight Zone levels of creepiness. I wish it was rarer. \n\nBut you asked a good question, so here's my thought - creepiness is when you're dealing with a situation that's not at all sexual, and really quite ordinary, but someone's acting like they got another signal from you entirely. \n\nNo matter what you do, they keep acting like you're doing something else. And you can't make it all normal again. Because they're hunting. \n\nIt's rare that it's this blatant. \n\nWhen it is...\n\nHow safe are you?\n\nHow are you supposed to know? \n\nYou handled it better than I would have...   I think it does depend on each individual person how creeped out they get by stuff like this (I have friends who get uncomfortable even with a casual \"passing on the street elevator-eyes\" situation), but I think what you describe would definitely fall on the \"creeptastic\" side for most people. Yes, and it's understandable. I just feel a bit guilty about being creeped out sometimes. I like to give people in these situations the benefit of the doubt, and think the best, but trusting one's instincts is very important. Thanks for the reply!",

    "title" : "A ParaGard insertion story! (xpost /r/birthcontrol; thought some people here might find it useful!)",
    "snippet" : "Hi folks!\n\nAfter a couple months of research I finally decided to get the ParaGard IUD. I'm 25 and have been on Yaz since I was 18, but now that I am in a monogamous relationship and I'm paranoid about babies because I never, ever want to have any, ever, the IUD sounded like an appealing way to take control of my (in)fertility for the next 12 years!\n\nI was a super wimp going into the procedure. I took a Xanax beforehand because I was scared I'd tense up and make it too hard for the doc to do her thing. I also took a BOATLOAD of ibuprofen, as I had been advised to do. I am also nulliparous so I was concerned maybe my cervix would be too tight, hence the ibuprofen + xanax, although I did not get a prescription beforehand for anything to dilate the cervix.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood doctor was THE BOMB. I was nervous so I made her chitchat with me while she poked around down there and she told me about how she herself had had ParaGard before she had kids and loved it. She also told me about her collection of IUDs from around the world, which sounded super cool!\n\nThe whole thing took maybe four minutes tops. First, she put a speculum in me. Then she washed my cervix with something (I felt nothing during this process) and then warned me there would be a little pinch. It was so tiny and mild, I swear you guys, it was less bad than if you pinch the skin on your wrist with your fingers.\n\nThen she inserted something through the cervix to assess my uterus. Even though I'm nulliparous, she had zero problem doing this. She warned me that this is the part that would cramp. You know when you take an Ex Lax and a couple hours later you kind of feel like \"ooh, that's a funny cramp, I think I'm gonna need to poo soon\"? It was exactly like that. On a \"this kinda hurts\" scale of 1 to 10, it was like a 3.\nShe showed me my adorable little copper ParaGard and then inserted it too. This was another Ex Lax-esque cramp (about a 4 on the crampy scale) that lasted about 5 seconds.\n\nAND THAT WAS IT! I was laughing at myself for freaking out beforehand. The insertion itself was super mild. Right now I am sitting at home with a heating pad on my tummy and a cup of mint tea because I have some mild cramps (but those could also be because I ate a lot of spicy food yesterday and was already having THOSE kind of cramps even before I went to get the IUD inserted). The Xanax still hasn't totally worn off so I'm still a little sleepy but other than that... this whole thing was so much less stressful than I anticipated.\n\nOh, and another thing: I'm staying on the Yaz for hormonal regulation. I use it to skip my periods and keep my PMDD in check. The doctor assured me that this is totally fine and that doubling up on protection is also fine. So anyone who is wondering if you can do Yaz + ParaGard, the answer is yes! Straight from the mouth of the awesome doctor at Planned Parenthood.",

    "title" : "Has anyone had a mole removed on their face?",
    "snippet" : "Hi ladies. I tried searching around for anything about this, but couldn't really find what I was looking for.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had experience having a mole removed from their face. My entire life I've had a mole on the lower left corner of my face -- almost like a beauty mark except it's only partially pigmented. I hate it. I have always hated it. I think it's ugly, despite anything anyone else tells me, and it is horribly obnoxious whenever I get an itch in that area. I had seen a dermatologist YEARS ago, honestly probably about 10 years ago, who told me to live with it because to get it removed would cause a horrible scar. Well, I'm to the point where I think I might rather live with a scar (I really hate this mole). \n\nSo I suppose what I want to ask is:\n\nHas anyone had a mole removed? What was it like? Is there scarring? Did you have it done by a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon? How much did it cost (if you don't mind disclosing)?\n\nI guess I just want to hear from someone else who has been in a similar situation to put my mind at ease. Finding the time between work and college to get anything done will be difficult anyway, so any stories you all could share with me to help me decide would be helpful and greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!  Well, I had a large mole on my neck shaved off for a biopsy. It was done by a dermatologist and it was under my parent's insurance, so I don't know how much it cost. The area was numbed and the procedure wasn't painful at all. I don't remember exactly how long it took, but it felt pretty quick. I now have a very slight raised scar. It's about as noticeable as a pale freckle. Not too pretty, but not horrible. If it were on my face, I'd be a bit self-conscious about it, but since it's just my neck I don't mind so much.\n\nMy mom has also had some moles removed, and I think hers were actually fully removed rather than shaved because her scars are different from mine. The spots where they were are small, white, slightly puckered circular scars. When I was nervous about getting my mole shaved, she told me that her procedures were quick and simple. The scars aren't raised any more than an old stretch mark might be, so even if they were very noticeable, they wouldn't need any more concealer than a small pimple might.  I have had some moles removed (mostly back + stomach area). Two several years ago, and five recently. The first two were shaved off with a kind of heated wire, and the other five with a scalpel and laser treatment. First two cost me 20$ each (dermatologist) and the last ones 100$ each (specialized surgeon). \n\nIt was pretty painless, got a local anaesthetic. They were realllllly itchy when they were healing though, all of them. My skin heals very slowly and not very well. The last ones I had done were in October...and they're still red and raised (some of them have started getting the brown pigmentation back, though really not as bad as before). The first two are now skin coloured scars (slightly raised) and one has a small beauty mark in the middle. I much prefer those two scars to the moles I had there before. I don't remember exactly how long it took to heal those two first ones....I'm a little worried about the new ones...I put Aloe on them every day, or every few days but they are taking their time. \n\nOverall though, if the scars end up looking like the first ones I had done, I will be extremely happy. They could probably be covered up with some makeup if they were on my face, and they are really a lot less noticeable than black moles for sure.  Thanks for warning me about the itching. I had a root canal done and the area that was worked on itched (yeah, it felt like my tooth/gum itched) for a month and it was miserable. I'd like to have known that in advance. But perhaps if it's on my body it won't be so bad (I'm also going to get one on my neck and one on my back removed). And thanks for letting me know the cost-- That makes me feel a lot better about looking into it.  [deleted]  I have had a couple of moles removed from my face. One was quite big and thick on my chin. I have a little scar there now that no one notices because it is so small and faded. The other is not noticeable at all (it was near my eye). Go get it done. I actually have a few indented chicken pox scars on my face that don't bother me in the least, so I think having a scar that can fade won't be so bad. Thanks for the encouragement. I was talking to my mom about it and she think's I'm stupid for wanting to get it removed; but I know what I want, and I'll go for it with or without her approval.   I had a cyst removed from my face a few years ago (dermo thought it was basal cell carcinoma, plastic surgeon removed it and biopsy revealed it was just a cyst) and the scar is barely noticeable. However, everyone scars differently. I'd recommend getting a plastic surgeon to remove the mole if it's on your face. They have the technique to minimize scarring (cutting and suture). Dermos are great, don't get me wrong, but it's your face. It's not painful at all, really. They'll numb the area (feels like a pinch) and when it wears off, it just feels like you smacked yourself in the face. Pop an NSAID, you're good to go. No biggie! If you want to push the issue, you can try to nag your dermo and claim you think it's been growing. They'll biopsy the whole thing off and probably cover a portion of it via insurance. \n\nOh, and if you go through with it, do **not** rub vitamin E on the scar. Recent studies show that it may do more harm than good for scars.  I wish I could judge how I scar, but I have one on my left wrist from surgery (to remove a cyst) that's faded to the point that I don't notice it anymore, and in the meantime have one on my other hand where I accidentally skinned it on the car door that hasn't faded much at all. But I suppose if it's just a cut and sew procedure it'll probably end up like the former rather than the latter. (sorry, I am talking to myself)\n\nI'm glad to know it's not that painful. Someone else mentioned itching, but I think I can survive that. We just switched insurance, so I have no idea what they cover, but I'll bring up the idea with my mom. \n\nAbout vitamin e oil- That's interesting! I had used it on my wrist-scar for a month or so before I got lazy. I don't think it helped much anyway. I'm not even sure where my container went. But thanks for the warning!  ",

    "title" : "Car accident and threat of lawsuit; I'm scaring myself sick over this. I don't know what to do.",
    "snippet" : "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nLast October, I was in a car accident on the freeway. The driver in front of me (let's call this car A) slowed and then slammed on his breaks, hitting the car in front of him (car B). According to the insurance companies, this happened first; I trust them more than my memory at this point. About a second later, I crashed into car A. I have gone over this dozens of times in my head, and I still don't know if I could've stopped in time. When I drive now, I make sure to leave as large a following distance as I reasonably can, but the fact is that what's done is done, and changing my driving habits now won't fix what's already happened.\n\nThe driver of car A seemed fine right after the accident, and even reassured me, saying something along the lines of \"Don't worry, I did the exact same thing\" (meaning he hit the car in front of him). I admit that at that point I was starting to cry hysterically, and maybe he just wanted to get me to stop.\n\nYesterday, I received a phone call from my insurance company saying that Driver A spent 3 nights in the hospital following the accident, he wants to know my policy limits, and that there is a chance he may sue for damages if my policy doesn't cover it. I have no idea what a lawsuit would entail. I'm 22 and still in college, and I don't want to force this onto my family.\n\nI can't tell anyone about this. My mom would freak out, and I don't want to make life even worse for my dad (as she is borderline emotionally/verbally abusive). My parents know I was in the accident, but they think it's already settled. Only a select few of my friends even know that the accident happened. I don't want to attract more hate/judgment from people who think it's my fault, which it very may well be.\n\nI don't know, I guess I'm looking for some support here. I don't know how to get myself out of this mess. Any words of wisdom you have would be appreciated.  Talk to your insurance agency. They may call you to get details and record a statement. If you have doubts about this person's honesty, let those doubts be known to your insurer. It is not normal for them to file 4 months after the accident and if an ambulance didn't come for that person at the scene don't take his word for having been in the hospital. Tell your insurer that he didn't seem injured at the time of the accident and let them know that he spoke with you etc.\n\nAlso, if your insurance is connected with your parents' you're probably better off letting them know before the insurance agency does. That said, insurers are always on the lookout for fraud and won't pay out just because some dude is looking for money. They'll want to investigate first. He can't just claim he's been in hospital through the insurance company he will have had to provide records of hospitalisation. Trying to accuse them of lying just makes you look shifty. She's not a doctor she can't speak for what injuries he may or may not have had.\n\nWhat would be the only issue in my eyes is there's no way to prove that any injuries he did get were not sustained from him rear ending the car in front of him, I don't think there's any way to prove that she's to blame and there's no way her insurance company is going to take that. He can't just claim he's been in hospital through the insurance company he will have had to provide records of hospitalisation. Trying to accuse them of lying just makes you look shifty.

I've been in situations where the other party called an ambulance while having no injuries -- trying to charge my insurance company for that is fraud. I've also had people try to blame me for existing damage and take it to my insurance agency and try to sue me. Both of these happened in the only two accidents I've ever been in and both of them were fender benders so minor that no paint was even scraped off. I think it is reasonable and prudent to let your insurance company know if you think you are being fleeced. Anyone who thinks badly of you for trying to protect yourself against fraud is mistaken, IMO.\n\nRegarding his alleged injuries, not for nothing, but if you are hospitalized for three days due to an accident then your injuries are probably apparent at the scene of the accident. If there was no reason to call an ambulance then I would at least want the veracity of the other party to be questioned by my insurer.     Unless he got a concussion, which would honestly make itself known clearly and quickly, I don't believe it would have anything to do with the car accident. I'm not seeing what would cause him to spend three days in a hospital, I'm saying this as someone whose been in a few accidents and who is an EMT, I'm simply not seeing it. Any problem that would require three days in a hospital from a car accident is rather evident.\n\nPersonally I don't think the fault is yours, assuming you followed the two second rule, the weather was perfect and you were going say, 25 - 30 mph(Because someone would've most definitely had to get an ambulance ride any higher along with there being stopped cars) there's no way you could've stopped in time unless you had a great car. You're in college, I don't think you have anything fantastic at the moment. You would've hit him even if your reflexes were top notch, you can't really fight physics and the Law of Motion. The person in front of you was an utter moron and wasn't paying attention on a high way. &gt; Personally I don't think the fault is yours, assuming you followed the two second rule.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that was followed based on other statements in the post, though that is just my speculation. Regardless though, I think if you run into the back of someone you are almost always at fault, unless the person literally pulled out onto the road right in front of you. It doesn't matter if you are following 30 seconds behind, you need to allow enough room to stop your car before hitting the person in front of you, even if they slam on the brakes unannounced. That is very true legally, legally she is at fault, but in my personal view, I can see why it happened and I don't blame her. As an example, I've had a friend this happened to, he was passing through an intersection behind a car and the light turned yellow and the woman in front of him slammed on her breaks... In the middle of the intersection. She also caused a pile up behind her because of that. In that case, he is legally at fault, but I have trouble seeing where practically he would be at fault.  Understandable, just in my opinion if you run into the back of someone while you are both going down the same road one of two things happened (or both). Either you were too close to be able to stop when they applied the brakes, or you weren't paying attention to the road. Both of those seem like the trailing driver is at fault both legally and practically. Even if you aren't expecting someone to slam on the brakes, I still think you should leave enough room that you can stop.",

I can't use tampons at all, even small ones are very painful to insert and won't stay in.

I'm trying to find non-hormonal options, so Mirena is out, and I've only heard about how painful the copper one is. \n\nI've heard that Canada has about 10 different options for IUDs, and already being in Minnesota, it wouldn't be too out of my way to take a weekend trip there. Does anyone know names or have info about IUDs that we can't get in the US? So far I've only heard of \"gynefix\" but there doesn't seem to be much info about it.   Since Mirena releases the hormones directly into your uterus, only a tiny fraction actually gets into your blood stream and affects your mood. Also, it only releases about 10% the amount of the pill.  \n  \nI've had Mirena for almost a year and have noticed no hormonal side-effects, even though I'm very sensitive to the pill.  Have you ever tried the Nuvaring? It has the same (specific) sort of hormones as the Mirena and it's also *supposed* to only affect the uterus directly, but that thing turned me into a witchy woman. Which is why I have the Paragard, heh.\n\nThe only thing I could work out is the ring involves a lot more hormones than the Mirena. Still, I'm far too chicken to risk it when I had such a horrible reaction with the ring.

    "title" : "Have any of you guys ever donated your eggs?",
    "snippet" : "I recently came across this http://www.optionsinconception.com/ egg donation website on Craigslist while looking for jobs. The topic of egg donation has also been discussed among my friends as well and it seems like a nice idea...you get paid and get to make a couple very happy.\n\nOne part of me is going \"But it's mine!\"\nAnd another is like \"But a couple who can't conceive will be very happy.\"\n\nAnd you get money.\n\nHave any of you ever donated our eggs? How was the experience?  This question comes up here a lot. I donated three times, enjoyed the experiences, and don't feel any need to interfere in the lives of the children produced by the procedures. Their parents worked incredibly hard to make their lives a reality and I try to honor that by not overstepping my role in it. It's definitely not suitable for most people but I didn't find it \"incredibly invasive\" at all. People get shockingly judgmental about things they don't want to do themselves (not you, others who post on threads like these), which can be a little annoying. Don't do it if you don't feel completely comfortable with it but respect that it's entirely possible to do this without being exploited, injured,or greedy. How does the process work, exactly? Basically you apply to an agency and fill out an extensive questionnaire about your life, health, education, family, etc. If everything looks good the agency contacts you and testing continues - blood tests, psychological tests, IQ tests, etc. Then they enter you into a database and prospective parents can search for donors that fit their criteria. If they choose you (it could take days, weeks, months years), a contract is drawn up that suits both parties. There is a lot of variability in the contract because it could specify that you have no contact with the offspring or it could be something like an \"open\" adoption where there is contact. Both parties just have to agree to the boundaries. \n\n\nOnce the terms are in place, the contract is signed and you start the medical aspect. You go on birth control and your cycle is synced up with whoever will be carrying the child. The injectable drugs start - this is what people seem to object to the most but they really aren't that bad. Some are done with a tiny insulin needle and about 50% of the time I couldn't even feel it. Later on the actual hormonal drugs are delivered by a larger needle (still pretty small) basically into the abdominal fat. Yes, you're sticking yourself with a needle. Yes, it's a little weird the first time. Unless you have a phobia of needles it becomes routine very quickly (like it does for diabetics, I imagine) . You do it at the same time every day, once a day, for less than a month. Throughout the process you have a few appointments (1-2 a week) with the doctor for blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds to ensure the follicles are coming along nicely and they adjust your meds according to the results. None of that stuff was too arduous. The ultrasounds are a little uncomfortable but not painful and only take a few minutes. I actually thought they were cool because I got to get an up close look at what my ovary and follicles actually looked like. I geeked out on that a bit. \n\nWhen the donation time comes you give yourself a final injection of human chorionic gonadotropin to induce ovulation. The extraction is done under anesthesia. They take an ultrasound probe that has an aspirator needle attached and use it to go through your cervix and pull the eggs that have matured out (usually about 20). Takes about an hour. I woke up a bit nauseous the first time, there was some abdominal pain/swelling that was easily managed with painkillers. After about a week I was back to normal. \n\nLike I said, it's not for everyone. I always tell people not to do it if they're trying to make \"easy\" money. The money is nice but what's nicer is helping someone start a family that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have.   I have not and will not. The reason they pay so much is because it's incredibly invasive. You have to go get hormone shots regularly for like months before they actually take the egg.  You can get over the fact that you weren't a birth vessel for an infertile couple. You can volunteer for your favorite charity and make more people very happy.\n\nIf you hung up on the fact that that egg is \"yours\" that a little person that is fifty percent of you is somewhere out there in the world and that you have terminated your rights to not see them, that you'll never get the get to know if they're safe and happy, or if they have your eyes or hair you may never get over that. That kind of pain causes some serious damage.\n\nUntil the part of going \"But it's mine\" is completely silenced, not just reasoned with, I wouldn't set yourself up for that potential pain and heartache. This is what I was trying to explain to my boyfriend who thought it was worth the money and that you are making someone happy.\n\nI can't really emotionally let go of the \"it's mine\" factor. And the fact that I will never get to see a child that has a part of me or know if they're doing well. I guess it's not for me. If you really want to help an infertile couple you can look into surrogacy.\n\nBasically it means a fertilized embryo from someone else would grow in your tummy.\n\nI know absolutely nothing about it, so you'll have to google/make another thread for more info.  It pays 5-10k? How long does it take? Maybe someone could make a career out of that, unless there's a donation limit. I assume it's invasive.\nThere is a donation limit of 6, I believe?",

I agree that is should be common knowledge (ideally) than Plan B and RU-486 are not the same thing.  However, we have only fairly recently definitively found out that Plan B does NOT prevent implantation (it only prevents ovulation). For many anti-choice people, a fertilized egg is a life and a pill that prevented the implantation of that egg would be considered an abortion of sorts.   Honestly, I don't think this will be much of a distinction to many pro-choice people.

The most [common](http://voices.yahoo.com/causes-breast-asymmetry-masses-teen-girls-7508684.html) are fibroadenoma and cysts.  It may also be lymph nodes. Don't make the assumption that it's something serious, but do go see a doctor. I know but why would I have this huge hard lump in he middle of chest now??? I can't answer that, nor can anyone else here.  That's why you should see a doctor.  But you should assume that it's most likely fibroadenoma, which alone accounts for 60% of breast tissue masses in teenage girls.  Please update us with how the doctor visit goes! I know it's hard to go and ask questions when you're worried about something. My entire face flushes dark red to purple when I see doctors unless I take a beta-blocker ahead of time and sometimes even then. So you're not alone with anxiety related to doctor visits. But please put your health before your anxiety and make an appointment! =) ok thank you I will try. its so horrible going!!!!!  I know but you can do it! And the agony of not knowing is always worse (IMO).   Your GP will usually lay you down and feel in circles around your breast tissue. Depending on how large your breasts are, they may have to press a little harder. If there's cause for concern, they'll probably order a mammogram. \n\nFor a mammogram, you stand in a low x-ray and (depending on the machine) have your breasts pressed slightly. Then they scan you up. It's cold but, besides that, not uncomfortable at all!\n\nHowever, some ladies just have harder or lumpier breasts than others and it could be normal for you. It could also be a smaller problem than cancer like cysts. Try not to worry yourself too much over it and get yourself to a doctor to either ease your mind or, worst case, jump on treatment. Good luck and be brave! thanks for replying. that makes it sound easier... can cysts get really big??  Yes, they can range in size from just a speck to the size of a golf ball.  yah I dont know honestly.. I just got a bad feeling because my breast did that thing where it became warm and stuff.,, meh :( I just got to go I guess   Because you are so young it's very unlikely that it's anything too serious.  Many young women have lumpy breasts - it can be monthly hormonal changes, perfectly normal fibrous tissue or cysts, or a number of other things.  I was in a similar situation to you and freaked out and basically thought I was going to die, and my doctor was very very reassuring and it turned out to be nothing - breasts are lumpy things, full of all different types of tissues, and change depending on where you are in your cycle.  I put off going to the doctor too, and it was such a relief when I finally went and was told it was fine.  Then I could finally stop worrying!  So make sure you go to a doctor and get it checked out, as it may be something that needs to be treated, but there are MANY things much more likely than cancer that could be causing this.  Please don't panic, you'll feel much better once you go.  If your GP feels something she doesn't like, she'll probably order an ultrasound, followed by a mammogram, and then followed by a biopsy. That was my level of progression. It took a month or two just to get through all the tests. If you're lucky, your doctor has that equipment in house, but I'm not sure how common that is.\n\nI think my doc ordered tests based starting with the least evasive. I had a few ultrasounds at different times of the month before we moved up to a mammogram. I'm also young, so the end result was that it was just how my breast tissue felt. I opted not to get a biopsy, my doctor didn't think it was that necessary, but offered it because it's the was a conclusive way to tell what the lump was.\n\nThat was a few years ago and everything turned out fine. :) in the meantime, you could cut out caffeine, which my doctor said creates/aggravates fibrous breast tissue. (please google that, I don't want to give you wrong info, it was a few years ago). Good Luck!   ",

So I breathed and said ok the did the first part were you need to drink water and stuff. She then tells me to get in the sturips. \n\nI don't know what type of tampons this lady uses but that probe was more like a smaller dildo I was shocked and kinda upset because she was completely misleading.

She kept on rubbing on my G spot  then would dig into what she said was getting a full view of my ovary which was incredibly painful. \n\nI am 26 and sexually active although its been awhile and I would not consider myself prude but I've been told by most sexual paertners that I'm pretty tight down there. \n\nI just feel very angry at that tech for playing it off as tampon like instrument when really it was more like a slim dildo that went really deep. \n\n\nAnd to top it off  I got a towel to wipe off with not even a wet wipe so I had to walk around with ultrasound goo all over my underwear and in my nook and cranny. \n\nEDIT: I'm glad I'm not the only one that's had this issue before. I am going to send a letter to the imaging department supervisor at the clinic I go to not blaming the tech but just how I felt uninformed and that it was nothing close to a tampon. \n\nIt's sad that some states require women to get these in order to obtain an abortion.

I'd be grateful if the ladies here can help me better prepare my patients for their experience. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nedit: Sorry, I should be more clear. I work in an ED (emergency department). We used to have a portable US in the dept with a vaginal probe. I have personally performed bedside vaginal US studies on my patients and have not noticed any (visible) discomfort nor received complaints of pain. (Hence my surprise at this post.) I do realize that there are women who will experience discomfort but was surprised at the number of negative responses.\n\nWhen I performed my own studies, I'd take the time to explain the process and show the probe I'd be using. There was no surprise to the patients. However, the probe broke and we could not yet afford a replacement. We still have a transabdominal probe that I still use but it's not effective in early pregnancies. So when a transvaginal study is indicated, the patients would be taken to the radiology dept for a formal study by an US tech.  I've never had one of these procedures, but this is my advice:\n\n1. Be realistic with them about things like size and the chance of discomfort/pain. \n\n2. Show them the device before you insert it. \n\n3. Tell patients before you insert the device that you can and will stop if they tell you to (and then DO stop if she asks). \n\n4. Maintain communication throughout the procedure. Tell her what you're doing, what you're going to do next, and tell her why.\n\n5. Take a minute before the procedure to talk to her.

If she can feel like you care about her comfort, it can help her relax. That's really good advice for ultrasound techs who * do* ultrasounds, but I think OP is a doctor who just sends people to have them, and was asking how he could better prepare his patients for what to expect.

If you could mentally prepare your patients beforehand, I think it would help.  I was told by a doctor that I needed an ultrasound to check out my ovaries... without being told it would be transvaginal.  That was a shock I got once I got there and the techs started explaining.  I know I had a shocked expression on my face and tried to not panic, but I was so unprepared mentally for the process that I was a little dumbfounded after it was over.

But when it comes to male physicians, it seems as though the internal ultrasound is treated somewhat like \"Oh I'm just going to shove this inside of you, and babies come out of that, so no big deal.\"  However, all women are physically very different and may have varying levels of comfort with having an object inserted for that purpose.\n\nFurthermore, there may be emotional issues involved with their reasons for the ultrasound.  Your patient may have been raped, or coerced in one way or another into the situation that led them to the ultrasound.  Sure, we'd all like to thing we are in charge of our own bodies.

I've had a couple during my PCOS diagnosis, and it was highly unpleasant. The size and shape reminded me of this waterproof g-spot vibrator I used to have. And it's not just a simple \"let's stick it in and have a look\" kind of thing. It was like my doc was in a flight simulator or something. Back and forth, shallower, deeper, angled every which way. The only thing that made it tolerable was the simple fact it was necessary for a proper diagnosis.\n\nThe tech was either referring to a tampon still in its wrapper, or was trying not to frighten you. Either way, not very professional.  Reading this thread makes me feel like the only person in the world who doesn't have a problem with trans vaginal ultrasounds.  Hm\n Reading this thread makes me feel like the only person in the world who doesn't have a problem with trans vaginal ultrasounds.  Hm\n I have somewhere about 6-7 in my life (some were repeats immediately after the last was done so their colleagues could see) and they never really bothered me either.  Some of the techs asked if I would be more comfortable inserting it myself, some insisted that I did, and others did it themselves.  Sometimes my husband was with me.  The worst part about any of this for me was having to have a full bladder.

Do you think that particular tech was just really aggressive with it? Reading this thread makes me feel like the only person in the world who doesn't have a problem with trans vaginal ultrasounds.  Hm\n  I have had FOUR in the past year. Once for determining if I had uterine fibroids, a second to check for the same thing with a different provider (because the first place was a bunch of idiots and lost all my info), a third at the beginning of my pregnancy to determine the fetal age, and a fourth last week **with my husband in the room** to check my cervix. \n\nWhen they sprang the fourth one on me, I was like, \"WTF. How many transvaginal ultrasounds do you people need??\" The tech said I could totally refuse and they had only recently begun introducing those with regular u/s visits in order to ensure the cervix was not dilating, check the placenta, etc... \n\nThe only good thing to come of all of this is that my husband can now cross off his wish list: sat next to wife while she was penetrated by another woman. \n\nEdit: I really think healthcare providers should inform a woman of these in advance of the visit. It is not a pleasant surprise. Ugh. I know how you feel! I cannot agree more, we should be told what KIND of ultrasound we're having when we next come in! I do feel like it is the provider's responsibility to make it known to their patient what kind of test they are ordering for them.  If you are having an ultrasound that looks specifically at your ovaries, or is for irregular periods, you WILL need to have a transvag u/s and your doc should be aware of that and should be warning you ahead of time.  I book appointments for ultrasound patients and I don't feel like I ought to be responsible for the ins and outs of your appointments - you either need to do some research yourself, or you need to talk to your doctor about what precisely is going to happen to you when they order your tests.  \n\nProbably not going to be popular, but: I have zero desire to have a conversation with a woman that involves me initiating the fact that there may be vaginal penetration involved in their test.  If you have questions about the procedure I'm happy to answer them for you, but I am NOT going to be the one that's like \"Oh, by the way, just so you know - this test involves a probe approximately the size of a small dildo, just so you're prepared.  See you on Friday!\" *click*\n\nIt is your responsibility as a patient to ask questions about your healthcare.  You have no idea the number of patients who call in to schedule appointments and they just have no clue what their provider has ordered for them.  \"Yeah I'm supposed to get some like imaging done on my like kidneys or something???\" -- you have no idea how often I hear shit like that.  **Know what you're getting into before you consent to procedures, bottom line.**\n\n**tl;dr** talk to your doctor about procedures before coming in for them!\n\nEDIT: General you, not you specifically! I agree whole-heartedly that patients should speak with their care providers, asking questions when they are curious. I also understand from experience that sometimes, people just havent encountered a pleasant or unpleasant situation, and thus have no reason to question that situation they're going through. Patients should do research, doctors should be more clear and upfront, not assuming that someone will just know what's going to happen on the next visit. \n\nFor example: I've had one pregnancy in my life time, back during 2007. The only type of ultrasound I had was outside of my body. I had no reason to ever suspect there was any other kind. I was surprised to learn otherwise when I was hospitalized in 2010 for ovarian cysts.\n\nNot everyone in the world is going to be completely privy to every single procedure, event, opinion, or action. For some people, it's laziness or negligence - blissful ignorance. For others, it's naïveté. There's a million and one reasons behind why someone doesn't know something, so we should just cover all of our bases.\n\nAlso, I don't blame you for not wanting to be the \"bearer of bad news\" on the phone, and it shouldn't be YOUR job. I have had FOUR in the past year. Once for determining if I had uterine fibroids, a second to check for the same thing with a different provider (because the first place was a bunch of idiots and lost all my info), a third at the beginning of my pregnancy to determine the fetal age, and a fourth last week **with my husband in the room** to check my cervix. \n\nWhen they sprang the fourth one on me, I was like, \"WTF.

It is not a pleasant surprise.     Yes, I had to get one to look for cysts and, even with a warning that it might hurt, I was shocked how painful it was!  It also REALLY pisses me off that there are states that make them mandatory before an abortion.  There's no medical reason for it... it's literally government mandated rape. I've actually seen physicians on reddit comment on this legislature - they have been very clear that in many - not all - instances, transvaginal ultrasound *is* medically indicated before many abortions. This is especially the case is early-term abortions.  \n\nI would agree that legislation mandating TVUs is enormously inappropriate, but it is untrue that \"there's no medical reason for it\". I guess I should say \"*When* there's no medical reason for it...\"  Oh girl, I'm sorry that was so horrible. I feel your pain. I had to have one once for evaluating ovarian cysts, and this was while I was still a VIRGIN. I was 17 at the time, and the tech was not only really impatient with me for being nervous, but basically called me a liar because \"no one at my age is still a virgin\". She also told me during the exam that \"pain from STDs can commonly be mistaken for ovarian cysts rupturing\". Needless to say I felt pretty violated AND accused and I complained to the hospital about her.   I had one awhile ago, and the tech was really sympathetic- she pulls out this big wand, and I'm all... what in the world is that? And she sighed and said, \"They didn't tell you what this was, did they?\" and went on to say that doctors almost never seem to prepare their patients- a lot of people think it's simply a lower ultrasound on their pelvic area instead of on the abdomen as is usual, and it's a really invasive procedure. She was really apologetic about it and said if there was an issue, we could forego the ultrasound, but I needed it, so honestly, I'd blame your doctor, not the tech, because ultrasounds in general involve a ton of pressure and squishing. If you'd been prepared by your doctor, it wouldn't have been so much of a shock. Though it does suck you didn't get a wipe of some sort :( It's sad how common of a thing this seems to be, though once I thought about the actual words I realized it could've been obvious, but again, it's just something the doctor should say- \"Here's the procedure, it's uncomfortable, are you okay proceeding?\" This is what I was thinking. It's unfortunate that they have to press so hard and that it's so uncomfortable, but that really *is* the nature of ultrasounds.          I have had this experience, but mine had quite an impact on me and still affects me. \nIt was my 19th birthday, and I'd been having pain during sex around my cervix, so the doctor ordered an ultrasound. I turned up and realised that I couldn't do the external one because I couldn't hold the liquid in (felt like I was going to burst) so the technician decided to do an internal one. She didn't show me what it looked like beforehand, she didn't warn me when it was going in. She used the tiniest amount of lubrication, to the point where it did nothing. I was crying, but she kept rolling this thing around in me, which felt the size of a dildo. She didn't acknowledge my pain, just kept going impassively. And when it was finally over, she pretty much ignored me and left me to clean up and leave the clinic. \n\nI was unable to drive away from the parking lot for about 20min, I was in shock and crying so much. When I went home my boyfriend comforted me, whilst his mother told me 'Well, these things happen to everyone'. I couldn't tell my parents the full extent, just said that it was  very painful. But to this day, I feel like I was raped. Before this I was fine getting pap smears, or being checked out by doctors. Now I shake and clamp up, it's so difficult to relax. I don't like dildos and the idea of using them really terrifies me. \n\nSo I think you are absolutely right to feel violated. In my experience with doctors/techs (and I've had quite a bit due to cervical issues) female doctors aren't as gentle as men when inspecting that area. The male doctors I've had have always been kind and soft, asking if I'm ok, or whether I'm in pain. Not to say I haven't had female doctors like this too, but I've had quite a few be too rough until I've asked them to be softer. \n\nSo I hope that you don't let this experience impact you too much like mine did. There are some wonderful technicians out there, it's just unfortunate when one or two spoil it for the rest (and hurt us in the process). I'm sorry this happened to you. If it is really affecting your life this much, I think it would be wise to seek counseling to help cope. Counseling really helps with stuff like this.                    I guess I am curious on why you didn't look into what the ultrasound(s) entailed beforehand- since you wanted to prepare yourself mentally? Something like this: http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=pelvus I guess I am curious on why you didn't look into what the ultrasound(s) entailed beforehand- since you wanted to prepare yourself mentally? Something like this: http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=pelvus I think they just told her \"ultrasound,\" which made her think of the regular kind, but I probably would have done a lot of research as well, and I think you'd come across this as a possibility. People really cannot trust doctors to keep them informed 100%. We really need to do our own research and know what we're getting into anytime we're prescribed anything (oh, this antibiotic causes blue pigmentation in skin? Thanks for not telling me after being on it for a year!) or have any sort of procedure done.\n\nedit: I realized this post makes it sound like I'm super skeptical of doctors or something. I'm not, but I'm just saying you really have the last say in what procedures you get and should really do research yourself to be best informed about what you're doing / having done to your body. I agree- your doctors should keep us informed. I would love it if this was the reality we lived in. But what we *do* live in is the information age, and we should be taking responsibility for using that to our advantage. I know that anytime something happens where I am in the dark, the first thing I do is research it. To not do so- and then blame someone you meet three minute before the procedure for your ignorance- is despicable. ",

This evening, she approached me very upset with the following anecdote:\n\nShe and her her man have had abundant sex until recently. Three weeks ago they had sex in the bathroom. Afterward, they went to bed and he didn't touch, kiss or hold her as he normally does. As a result, she didn't sleep well that night. She was getting ready for work the next morning while he was awake, in bed, watching her. From under the sheets, he said, \"Is everything okay down there?\" She said yes and asked why he asked. He said she probably didn't want to hear what he had to say. She pressed the issue and he told her, \"Well, when we had sex last night the texture was different.\" She immediately inferred she should go to the gynecologist. He told her not to, she freaked out, yadda yadda. He eventually told her that, because the texture was different, he is losing interest. \"I'm sensitive,\" he said.\n\nLadies of reddit, what. the. fuck. The \"texture\" was *different*?\n\n(Also, I should add that he has admitted to her that he can actually smell the change in hormones - on her hairline - before she starts her period. He can \"predict\" it. He's so \"sensitive\" to things because he was born with one testicle.)\n\n2XC, in what ways have your past lovers \"lost interest\"?  &gt;He's so \"sensitive\" to things because he was born with one testicle.\n\nWait, WHAT? I don't understand this at all. What does that even mean? I don't have any testicles but I can't even \"predict\" when my own damn period is going to start. This is his excuse for everything. He's ultra sensitive about *all the things*. It's ridiculous.  Wait, I can get super powers by losing a testicle? Where do I sign up? Wait, I can get super powers by losing a testicle? Where do I sign up?  I wish we could nominate a WTF post of the day. You win so far! ;)\n\nHe's a moron. The different texture probably had more to do with the height of her cervix changing as she progressed through her cycle.\n\nThis is so douchey I actually find it morbidly hilarious. I'm sure he and his testicle will find a perfect vagina in a state of complete stasis someday. :p\n\nGive your poor 20 year old friend a pat on the back n behalf of all of 2X and let her know there's *nothing wrong with her.* God.

His testicle has nothing to do with it. I assume the natural processes that all women go through are just more evident in some of them. I just stumbled upon this thread and needed to put my two cents in since although in my experience what he experienced was probably correct his actions were horrid.  Just tuck your cock and balls between your legs when you type :P  I just wanted to chime in since as a man I've experienced similar \"changes\" to my longtime girlfriends vagina a day or two before menstruation. On a side note; I am allowed to post in this subreddit right?\n\n\n But back to my point; he seems like he has issues and is very disrespectful but his experiences are probably valid. I notice a texture change shortly before and after my girlfriends period; I find it pleasant, its almost a tiny bit rougher and gives for better sensations. There is a smell difference as well; again not bad, just different and noticeably so. Sort of the difference between a normal day of myself not showering and a day where I went for a run and did not shower; a stronger smell but the same. \n\nFinally, there is a noticeable difference in taste. It does get very bitter a day or two before her period and I assume this is related to what causes the increase in odour. Its not a bad taste but I drink strong black coffee like its water. \n\nAs far as I can see his experiences were valid but how he interpreted them made him a bit of an asshole.

I just stumbled upon this thread and needed to put my two cents in since although in my experience what he experienced was probably correct his actions were horrid.   &gt;He eventually told her that, because the texture was different, he is losing interest. \n\nThey must be *really* newly dating. Has she gone through a complete period cycle while dating him yet? It just seems like if he can indeed feel a difference in her vagina due to the stage of her cycle, why would that make him \"start losing interest\"? Does he not know what a *cycle* means? It means you repeat the same cycle over and over and over in a never ending *cycle.* So whatever texture he felt last week he'll feel again in a couple of weeks and the texture he feels now he'll feel again in a few more weeks. \"Losing interest\" because of how her body changes every month? Fuuuuuck that! This.\n\nThey've been sleeping together since...August? I'm pretty sure it's August. So, in other words, multiple cycles. He said he thinks it's happened one other time. He's also over 30 years old. You'd think he'd *know* by now. God, I wanna punch him. I'm sorry, but I'm laughing so hard. He is so awful and out of touch with reality.   Well he certainly sounds like a keeper! /s  I had a boyfriend lose interest because I wasn't willing to make my body look like megan fox's (specifically), but nothing at all like this. It's kind of impressive how specific his complaint is. The texture... like he's some kind of vagina connoisseur. I think there can be changes in the feeling, my husband says that it starts to feel just slightly more relaxed the closer I get to my period, so maybe he might have some validity.  Someone I was dating as a college student once lost interest in me because my summer job ended and I no longer wore collared shirts everyday. It wasn't that I was dressed like a slob; just no collared shirts.\n\nSome people are just stupidly finicky.  He's cray-cray.  So this guy is 30? Is he new to sexytimes?\n\nBecause, this whole thing just smacks of ignorant egotism. He thinks he has special sensitivity powers because he has only one ball? Is that to imply that he has less testosterone and therefore is more \"sensitive\" in a \"girly\" way with texture and smell? I'm so confused. \n\nYes, textures of the vaginal canal change with fluctuation in hormones. Just like levels of lubrication, degrees of scent, etc. ebb and flow with a ladies flow.\n\nBut I've had my vagina for TWENTY NINE years and I still can't predict when the fuck I'm going to menstruate.  He isn't new to it...he's just an idiot. \n\nMan, if having a single nut meant I could predict my cycle and how long it's gonna last...I'd be on that like white on rice. I know! Man, if I could just sniff my ponytail and think, \n\"Gee, no white skirts today!\"  [deleted] It's not quite the same, as he seems to be alleging that her vagina was fine until the texture suddenly changed. This isn't exactly likely - short of giving birth or having a medical procedure it's not likely that her vagina would have any dramatic textural change. It seems more likely he's losing interest and just bullshitting.  He's a weird dude. I mean, he says he can smell her homone change two days before her period on her hairline. And, not hair \"down there\", as he puts it...the hairline around her face.  I have a friend who can smell when people are on their period. She hates it, but it is extremely accurate. Some people just have much more sensitive noses than others, that doesn't make them weird. I have a friend who can smell when people are on their period. She hates it, but it is extremely accurate. Some people just have much more sensitive noses than others, that doesn't make them weird. It's not even that he can smell when she's *on* her period. Every woman's scent changes during that time...and other times of the month, for that matter. What I'm talking about is the 2 day advanced notice she has because her *hairline* smells different. It's weird. It doesn't seem much different than smelling when someone is menstruating. He is smelling something before, instead of during. There are things to fairly criticize him for, being able to smell changes in somebody's scent doesn't seem like a good one though. Okay, how about the fact that he's complaining about something that is an entirely **natural** process and making her feel as though something is *wrong* with her?? That's a dick move. 100%. It's not like she can change the way her body smells when it's a nearly undetectable scent on her *hairline*. It's stupid. Agreed, complaining about it is a dick move. Though if he doesn't like the smell, there is nothing wrong with that since he has no control over it. He's a weird dude. I mean, he says he can smell her homone change two days before her period on her hairline. And, not hair \"down there\", as he puts it...the hairline around her face. ",

    "title" : "I feel abandoned and completely overwhelmed. How can I explain PTSD, anxiety and depression to a person who has no clue? Does anybody have any helpful advice or analogies? [more story inside]",
    "snippet" : "TwoX has more traffic than r/PTSD and you all have been so so helpful to me in the past. This is not about karma, this is about hopefully getting help.\n\nI have PTSD caused by sexual/physical abuse just to clarify that this is not caused by military combat. I am having a HUGE problem feeling validated by my SO. He doesn't seem to understand the realness of my illness. In fact, not many people do. I am lost. I need help explaining and teaching others how real anxiety, depression, flashbacks, insomnia, and panic attacks are. \n\n\nEDIT: I do have a therapist that I can not afford to see very often. Therapy has been a great help and it's great advice but I really want advice from sufferer's themselves. \n\n\nEDIT: I have zero energy and my SO just walked out because of his lack motivation to even remotely try to understand me. I feel at my lowest. I have to move my life now. Everything is falling apart.\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the advice everyone.    PTSD is a gun to the head, and a magic bullet that takes you to Hell. All it takes is for someone to pull the trigger. \n\nIf he needs help understanding, it might help him to think of it as conditioning, a reverse Pavlovian response. Your brain wants to keep you alive. In people with PTSD, fight or flight or play dead could keep the horror from ever happening again. \n\nThe problem? Thanks to mass communication, we live in a society where it's nearly impossible to escape triggers, and we aren't evolved to deal with it. It takes time to overcome the past, and it takes patience from those who love us. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm a man. Even if it's the last thing I want to do, I can handle myself in a fight when I need to defend those I care about. My sex life is great, thanks sincerely, for not asking. \n\nBut I suffer from PTSD, also not caused by military combat. I'll spare you a lot of details, and skip to one small aspect that maybe your SO can understand -\n\nI can't touch an animal, without seeing it hurt. Someone once upon a time wanted me to make the connection, between a gentle touch and pain, and they knew just how to kick that big German Shepard where it would hurt the most. \n\nNow, in the present time, does it mean I can't pet a dog anyways? Of course not. It just means I pay the price to do what comes to others without a second thought...\n\n That first analogy is pretty god damn spot on. You make a great point and it's so well written. Thank you for responding. However, I don't know if it's lack of sleep but I am not quite understanding the last analogy. Would you mind elaborating a little more? \n\n\nHonestly, your words are very very helpful. I could use you here in real life to word things this way. I find it hard to get through the anxiety and that fight or flight feeling when dealing with conflict. I feel like I need a translator.   Have you thought about seeking professional help? Most of the times professionally educated therapists are way better (as can be expected) in dealing with this than immediate family members, who are often times overwhelmed and dont know what to say. Its not their fault, I know many people who dont know how to act when being confronted with this stuff.\n\n\n\n  I have exactly the same issues as you do, actually, down to the cause of the PTSD. With my SO, it helped to send him articles to read- sometimes, people don't listen 100% to people they know. Thank you I can say, it does get better. Slowly, but it does. I can say, it does get better. Slowly, but it does.   I survived an incredibly traumatic, life-threatening situation mere days after my first date with my SO, who has basically never had anything really awful happen to him in his life so he couldn't exactly relate to how one would cope. He's also from a country where they don't have the same public dialogue around PTSD so he was extra oblivious. In fact I'm not sure he believes in the \"realness\" of my PTSD but honestly I don't think it would help if he did. I personally need validation less than I need the people close to me to respect my own assessment of my emotional well-being, and to be considerate of it. There's no way I could open up to anyone who wasn't that way about it.\n\nThere have been a lot of instances where my boyfriend and my housemate (both from the same country and both very dear to me) have said some really insensitive things about how I was coping, but sensitivity comes from familiarity and understanding - it's not like they meant to leave me feeling misunderstood and dismissed, but what they said was the obvious thing for them to say. Stuff like \"you realize all this is in your head, right?\" and \"I'm sorry you're depressed, why don't you just stop being depressed?\" Seriously it was like these guys had never encountered mental illness before in their lives. I felt totally invalidated and it hurt like hell, and if they'd meant to undercut my self-compassion then they'd be shitty people, but they were just naïve and it seemed like legitimate advice to them. I explained to them why that advice was not just unhelpful but also hurtful and they learned how to adapt. Never attribute to malice what can be easily explained by ignorance, but at least ignorance can be mended.\n\nWhat ended up working for us was for me to be honest and open about what I was experiencing, and to just let it all hang out. My SO didn't know what a panic attack is like but he held my hand and helped me come down from one. He didn't know what it's like to have horrible nightmares (seriously he never dreams) and to be afraid of sleep as a result, but he helped me go back to sleep every night when I woke up convinced the house was on fire. My housemate thought my irrational thoughts born of an intense fear of loss were totally insane, so he supplemented them with his own sound judgement and with his help I learned how to ignore the crazy and keep the anxiety at bay. They both thought it was weird that I was experiencing all this but that didn't matter because they loved and supported me.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is that I found people tend to react in really weird, insensitive, inappropriate ways to my trauma. It's like they can't process it, like the part of their heart/mind that handles empathy is so afraid of letting in so much pain that it just shuts down. It's incredibly difficult to relate to someone who has gone through abuse when you've never experienced it yourself - this is another thing I struggle with relating to my boyfriend, because I have been sexually abused in the past and it's just… beyond his comprehension - and as a result it's incredibly difficult to respond in a sensitive manner. That sensitivity comes from a familiarity with a certain intensity of suffering and most people are blessed to have never experienced it. My friends who have been the biggest support have all related to my pain by revisiting some awful events in their own lives and remembering what it was like and what they needed to heal, but if they'd never experienced anything like that, or if they were afraid to look into the darkness, then they couldn't have been nearly as compassionate as they were. (Note: there are definitely some people who are just innately empathetic and brave enough to willingly look into someone else's hurt without having gone through trauma themselves, but in my experience they're so rare that I'm willing to make these generalizations.)\n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck and I hope you find some peace.   It's impossible to explain PTSD. I have it from when I was in the Army and I didn't even see anything particularly crazy when I was in Iraq.\n\nTalking to therapists has been absolutely zero help for me. I always feel as though I'm being condescended to or at best a fake sense of concern. These people don't know what the fuck I've been through or seen, sitting in a fucking classroom and having a piece of paper that says they are some kind of expert doesn't actually make them qualified to help me.\n\nI've found that talking to family and friends is much more effective because they actually give a shit and they aren't being paid to do so. Granted I have quite a few friends who have had the same experience as I did, it has to be harder for someone in your situation to find someone who can understand what you've been through.\n\nThe thing that pisses me off is since I've been diagnosed some people assume I'm a ticking time bomb that is waiting to go off on some kind of killing spree. They don't understand that PTSD manifests itself differently in different people depending on their experiences. I cry in my sleep almost every night and have terrible nightmares and I have some anxiety when I'm in crowds or heavy traffic. It's led to me not being able to let new people into my life for fear they won't understand, but I have to deal with it in my own way which doesn't include paying some person an exorbitant fee for an hour session every week so some \"expert\" can pretend to care when I have family and friends who will be there whenever I need them for free.   I REALLY wish I could give you better news - but I still haven't found a way.  I got diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder verging on PTSD (caused by emotional/verbal/somewhat sexual abuse) 2 years ago this month.  My family still doesn't understand - MY OWN FAMILY!  I go into a panic attack and I'm told to breathe and calm down - not possible. I get anxious, they say to get over it.\n\nThe only way I've been able to get my point across is by saying \"Telling me not to be anxious is like telling water not to be wet\".  Sometimes they get it.  I usually just keep my anxieties to myself now. People can't SEE the problem, so they don't believe there is one.  After all - everyone worries, but most people are able to have more control over it - I can't.\n\nI have some friends who understand - sometimes I'll talk to them about it.  Otherwise I keep it to myself.  My family thinks I'm weak for being unable to control myself. I HATE when people tell me to \"just breathe\". I know that they're trying but in the moment I want to rip their face off.  I can totally relate to the family thing. For me, my family is the source of my PTSD, so not only are they the cause but they brush it off. It's a double slap in the face. It is so incredibly difficult to struggle alone. At least I find it difficult. \n\nThat's why we have Reddit :)  I know right?! Its like \"you think I don't want to breathe? You think that if that was a possibility, I wouldn't be doing it right now?!\" Lol. My dad caused mine so same case sorta  My Dad too. Yay for shitty Dad's and the aftermath that is \"daddy issues\".    ",

    "snippet" : "My sisters bridal shower is in two weeks and I need more game ideas that aren't totally lame and stupid.\n\nThis is not at all my type of thing, and I want to make it as fun as possible for everyone.  Any suggestions?  Ideas of games you've played in the past that were actually fun?  How can we make present opening a less painful experience? (any ideas other that gift bingo?)\n\nTL/DR: how can I make a bridal shower fun?  The best bridal showers I've been to didn't involve games OR present opening. Very few people care to watch an adult open gifts - you're right, it's generally a painful experience. Just get together, have some food and drinks and celebrate the event. To me, the \"fun\" is getting to hang out and catch up with friends and family - it's still a bridal shower without any of the rest of it, and I honestly get a little annoyed when conversation is interrupted for a game. \n\nThat said, what would your sister want? Is she the type that would be embarrassed to open a bunch of presents in front of everyone? Then don't do it. If she's into the more traditional thing, just have her open the gifts, no need to drag it out with a game as well. \n\nIMO, bridal shower games are ALL lame and stupid. Again, if that's something your sister wants, go on the knot or whatever and make plans to play purse scavenger hunt or TP wedding dress. What's the crowd like? If they're all (most?) of the non-traditional persuasion, and you still want to have games, play some regular old board games. There are no rules for what MUST OCCUR at a bridal shower. \n\nNow of course I'm not meaning to offend anyone and there's nothing wrong with wanting a more traditional style bridal shower if that's what your sister wants. I'm just pointing out that you can still do a fun bridal shower, just celebrating your sister's marriage without any of the traditional stuff and it still counts as a bridal shower (again, and I emphasize, IF that's what your sister would want). Oh no offense taken - I'm totally with you, but my sister is LOVING the limelight of it all.  I suggested not doing presents there and she was appalled.  (I would never be able to maintain her open enthusiasm and for wooden spoons and whisks while in front of an audience - how awkward!)\n\nthis is going to be miserable lol.  fml :/   I just went to a bridal shower where the bride's friends had organized for a belly dance teacher to come and teach us some moves and a very simple dance! So we were active and having fun with our jingly coin belts, worked up an appetite for the soup and salad bar lunch, and finally sat on the floor and she opened presents. No games; just a book passed around where we all wrote our advice to the bride, regardless of if we were married or not. :) It was a really fun bridal shower; I had never thought of a structured activity like a dance class being part of one before, but I enjoyed it.

    "snippet" : "This is on my phone so sorry for typos. \n\nI've seen a lot of experience and support come from this sub and I'm not sure who to talk to. \nMy eldest brother has always been physically and emotionally abusive to me and my other brother. My parents coddled him because he was \"emotionally disturbed.\" My brother S and I have always been really close and we assume that my parents just hold him up as the golden first child. By the time they had me, the youngest, they were jaded. My mother genuinely doesn't like me, but her antidepressants stifle her feelings. The only person she protects is W, the eldest. \n\nW got married to M a couple of years ago, they have now been together for a total of seven years. He is emotionally and physically abusive to her. They got married because she was pregnant, then she miscarried a month later. The next time she got pregnant he beat her and she miscarried again. \n\nM often confides in me because I have also suffered under W's abuse. This morning she texted me, told me W has destroyed all of the electronics in her home, punched in the screen of her laptop, kicked in the big screen TV, smashed the Wii. She said it's because she wouldn't give him cash for weed. On the one hand I was so proud of her because I have been encouraging her to cut him off financially for a long time. On the other hand, I'm scared for her. \n\nShe said she keeps telling him to leave (her house, she pays for everything) but he won't. I think it's because he knows she breaks down easily. And I, not for the first time, have told her to call the police and get a restraining order. \n\nW grows weed in the house. He has several plants. Her repeated excuse is that she doesn't want to go to jail for the plants. I feel like that's a lie, she's more afraid of standing up to W. I also don't think she'll go to jail if she explains the situation, that he's abused and threatened her for so long that he's convinced her that if she says anything she'll be punished. \n\nI asked her to come stay with me but she refused because I live with my parents and she hates them for turning a blind eye for so long. My parents have always led by example to ignore conflict.\n\nI want to help; I just don't know how. Does anyone have any advice?\n\n\nEdit: I am so so grateful to everyone who took the time to reply. This situation has taught me just how deeply my parent's behavior has affected me. To take action against my brother, who has never had to answer for any of his bad behavior, is terrifying. I realize now how much I have been encouraged to ignore, and I see my parents in a whole new unflattering light. \n\nA lot of you have said to get a lawyer, and at first I was shocked. Why do we need a lawyer? I can't even see my brother in a courtroom. I needed to post this so I can see the next step. Of course we need a lawyer. \n\nI want to take a course of action that leaves the drugs intact so that there will be something tangible that will put him in jail, but if my sister in law says she won't move forward with them over her head, I'll feel like we have no choice. \n\nI've watched my sister in law take the steps to prepare for this and I feel so profoundly grateful that so many of you helped me see which way we need to go from here.

Go to a lawyer yourself and get some solid advice on how to help.   I'm so sorry you're dealing with all of this.  I don't really have much in the way of advice for how to help you SIL (I'm sure a lot of others will chime in).\n\nOne thing I can tell you: if your SIL is the sole/primary breadwinner (sounds like she is) then she really shouldn't be living in a house where somebody is growing weed.  Under the law, if she doesn't move the hell out and then turn him in, SHE will be going to jail along with him should the grow operation be busted. This is because if you're living there, the law assumes you must know about it, and if you tolerate it its the same as if you did it yourself.  This is especially so when you are married to the grower.\n\nFirst, she should leave (women's shelter would be a great first step), get a restraining order, and then let her work know about the order in case he decides to show up there.  The folks at the shelter should be able to help her with getting on her feet.  One way to make sure he isn't able to menace her after leaving, is to turn him in. This can even be done anonymously. Thanks for replying, but I was afraid of this answer. She won't go to a shelter because she runs a kennel/animal shelter out of her house. If she leaves, she'll be giving up her business and abandoning her animals. She'd never do that. Her animals are her kids. \n\nI've considered reporting him anonymously, pretending to be a neighbor who could hear the arguing or something. Do you know if I call the non emergency police line or if there's a certain place to report it to?  She needs to call the DV hotline. They have legal resources that can get **him** out of the house. If she is upfront about the weed, and her fear of being harmed over turning him in she is unlikely to be charged. He will likely be in jail for a bit and have a restraining order put on him.\n\nSource: my ex was abusive and had drugs in the house. I called the DV hotline, told them everything, and he got charged with possession *and* coersion (a felony). I got charged with nothing and got a restraining order. Thanks for this response. This precise solution is what I was hoping for so he could get jail time for the drugs, I'm just afraid he's scared her so much with the possible worst case scenario consequences.  Possession is different that growing. I would contact a lawyer first. Yeah, RiverSong42's suggestion sounds iffy. \n\nI suspect it could really vary depending on the department and where you live--claiming that you were coerced into allowing the grow to happen in your house might or might not hold up. Thanks for this response. This precise solution is what I was hoping for so he could get jail time for the drugs, I'm just afraid he's scared her so much with the possible worst case scenario consequences.  Consult with a lawyer before you get your sister arrested. She is completely complicit in the crime and will 100% be charged. If anything, her boyfriend will be the one not getting charged. The best case scenario if she turned her boyfriend in would be that she would be found not guilty - obviously at huge expense. Cases are brought to court on a \"is there a legal question to answer\" basis - and in your sisters case, there is. You need to arrange for her to be given immunity through a lawyer before you contact any authorities. IANAL but I would imagine that you could make a *strong* argument about being under duress considering the OP has said her brother just smashed all of the electronics in the house. This is very difficult to assess without knowing where this happened and a full briefing of the facts, but it is obviously far better to not be charged than to defend yourself, so I strongly stand by my analysis. \n\nHowever, it might be easy to show that the OP's sister was under duress from her circumstances, but it is far easier for a prosecutor to show that there have been times when she was not. The fact that she has obviously told her sister about the grow operation would be enough to demolish that defense. Case law and local statute are heavily relevant, but it isn't likely that she would be able to establish that for the entirety of their relationship she was unable to seek help. On top of that, depending on where she lives, she may have to prove her innocence rather than to be assumed innocent until proven otherwise.\n\nThe case is a legal mess and any trial would be complex and expensive. The OP should not go forward until seeking advice from a lawyer. She lives in the US, in theory she is innocent until proven guilty. It doesn't matter where she is in the US, this applies universally. I agree she needs legal advice though.  Thanks for this response. This precise solution is what I was hoping for so he could get jail time for the drugs, I'm just afraid he's scared her so much with the possible worst case scenario consequences.  By the sounds of things, she could also have him done for destroying her property and domestic violence. It sounds like the longer he is away the better. \n\nI would recommend your sister get cognitive behavioural therapy too. It sounds like she has some very unhealthy ways of dealing with problems. Thanks for this response.

Thanks for this response. This precise solution is what I was hoping for so he could get jail time for the drugs, I'm just afraid he's scared her so much with the possible worst case scenario consequences.  She needs to call the DV hotline. They have legal resources that can get **him** out of the house. If she is upfront about the weed, and her fear of being harmed over turning him in she is unlikely to be charged. He will likely be in jail for a bit and have a restraining order put on him.\n\nSource: my ex was abusive and had drugs in the house. I called the DV hotline, told them everything, and he got charged with possession *and* coersion (a felony). I got charged with nothing and got a restraining order. \"if she is up front about the weed she is unlikely to be charged\" \n\ndepends on the state. she doesn't just have some weed in the house. she has a grow op. under the law, her home can be seized. unfortunately, cannabis laws vary wildly; in washington or colorado neither one of them might end up being charged while in florida they could both end up in prison with her home seized. \n\nso her concern may very well be justified. she obviously still needs to get out, but it would be smart to consult with a lawyer or someone like that first. if the dv hotline is run by someone other than the police, she could probably get the advice she needs on this issue from them. \n\n She *could* be charged, that is true. But, A. Any decent lawyer can get the charge dropped or reduced, let's face it this lady isn't ratting out her husband's grow op because she fears for her safety not out of love. And B. a drug charge sure is better than remaining in that kind of abusive relationship. \n\nWhen I used the services of the DV hotline, they acted as go-betweens between me, and the cops, the courts and CPS. \n\nTL;DR she could get charged for the weed, but it's worth the risk. i would just hate to see her doubly victimized. i absolutely agree she should get out, but she just needs to make sure she's protected. \n\nwhen i got out of my abusive situation, i had to have a plan first. i think a lot of people do this. finding out how to protect herself against charges just needs to be part of her plan. :)  I'm afraid of that. I'm so afraid of her finally getting the courage after all these years to walk away from her shitty husband only to end up in jail because her shitty husband is also a drug addict.

Thanks for replying, but I was afraid of this answer. She won't go to a shelter because she runs a kennel/animal shelter out of her house.

I'm not sure how elaborate the setup is and the extent to which this would be plausible, but if she's liable for it, it seems like taking steps to get rid of it might be a very good step in any event. They can be destroyed, it's not elaborate at all. The only problem is that he never leaves the house.  They can be destroyed, it's not elaborate at all. The only problem is that he never leaves the house.  Do NOT destroy them. They will charge her.  why can they charge her for destroying them? Destroying evidence is a crime. Is it evidence if there's not an investigation going? I mean, I destroy papers all the time that could be used as evidence in any number of criminal proceedings, but no one has ever said anything about it being presumed evidence before the police even get involved. Papers and a controlled substance are two very different things.  Do NOT destroy them. They will charge her.  Thanks for replying, but I was afraid of this answer.

Do you know if I call the non emergency police line or if there's a certain place to report it to?  If you can get her to agree to kicking your brother out for good, here is a plan:\n\nWait until he leaves the house for a few hours, or get your other brother or a friend to get him out. Get all the weed plants and put them in trash bags and throw them out in a dumpster. remember to wear gloves and vacuum afterwards. Get all of his stuff out of the house and onto the street. Get new locks (you should have these ready before he leaves the house so you don't waste time). Make sure all windows and doors can be secured and locked. Make sure that NOTHING of his is left in the house so that he has no excuses for coming back to her house. Meet up with him in a very populated place and break the news to him. If he has a key to anything she owns, get it back. Go to the police and file a police report for the damaged items and the abuse. Make sure you have pictures with you. The police can guide you to getting a restraining order against him. She should start divorce proceedings as soon as possible. Help her start looking for good attorneys. If he comes anywhere near her while she has the restraining order, she needs to call the police so they can take him away. If he has had violent outbursts over such small things, I worry about her safety now. She could also look into getting some self defense weapons like mace. She can't afford to take any chances. I agree with most of this, but my only concern would be destroying the plants.\n\nThat was my first thought, too--\"Why not just throw them out?\" But, as others have pointed out, that route could cause her to be held liable for destruction of evidence or something if things go south.

Do you know if I call the non emergency police line or if there's a certain place to report it to?  I'm so sorry you're dealing with all of this.  I don't really have much in the way of advice for how to help you SIL (I'm sure a lot of others will chime in).\n\nOne thing I can tell you: if your SIL is the sole/primary breadwinner (sounds like she is) then she really shouldn't be living in a house where somebody is growing weed.  Under the law, if she doesn't move the hell out and then turn him in, SHE will be going to jail along with him should the grow operation be busted. This is because if you're living there, the law assumes you must know about it, and if you tolerate it its the same as if you did it yourself.  This is especially so when you are married to the grower.\n\nFirst, she should leave (women's shelter would be a great first step), get a restraining order, and then let her work know about the order in case he decides to show up there.  The folks at the shelter should be able to help her with getting on her feet.  One way to make sure he isn't able to menace her after leaving, is to turn him in. This can even be done anonymously. But if she proves she only tolerated it for fear of him beating her then she shouldn't be liable. She is under duress at this point, isn't she? This is what I've been hoping. If this is true and i can prove it then I think I can convince her to report him.  But if she proves she only tolerated it for fear of him beating her then she shouldn't be liable. She is under duress at this point, isn't she? Depends on the state- the problem with that is \"proof\". If she has all the money she has a way out (that's what the gov will see). And honestly. It sounds true so far  She can testify that she feared for her wellbeing. That is technically proof. That really depends on whether the police and/or courts believe her.

I don't want to outright ask you how old you are, but perhaps if you're old enough and are in fact good friends with her, maybe the two of you could find a place to live together for a little while. It sounds like living at your parents house may be the source of some pain for you, and obviously M's home is causing her turmoil as well. The first time she was beaten, she should have been out of there, but I can understand how impossible that seems. In a really distorted sense, it's a blessing that they have no children together because her escape will be all the easier for it. I really wish you guys the best, and I hope that you're able to continue your friendship together and work on the relationship with your parents.

I kept hammering away on my last friend who was being abused by telling them every day \"if you don't leave you will die\". Eventually, they got it, but not without the hell being beaten out of them quite a few times. Battered woman syndrome is no joke-- they feel like they can't leave. Her best bet is to get rid of the plants, and get a restraining order on the basis of abuse against your brother, and gingerly move his stuff out front. If he violates that order, he can go to jail. If she's not willing to do this, then there's not much you can do. You can't save everyone, sadly.  I know it's no joke, but I know she's ready. I can feel it. It's why I've been supportive until now, and now I need to help her out. The only thing holding her back is the fear of jail time from the drugs.  I know it's no joke, but I know she's ready. I can feel it. It's why I've been supportive until now, and now I need to help her out. The only thing holding her back is the fear of jail time from the drugs.   Until she is ready to leave (which should be yesterday, but it takes time..) she should record every evidence of being abused. Let her keep a diary (may be for safety reason not at her place, but yours?) log every peace of abuse, verbally and physically. Make pictures of bruises and of the trashed house and add those to the diary. \nThis will help her when she is out and wants a restraining order. It might help her when she is not out and the polices come in to collect those weed plants but I am not sure of that.  She's been doing that. She told me today she's got photos and a journal and that was what let me know she's ready.  She should give you copies of the photos and journal for safekeeping or back them up digitally so that he can't can't destroy them. Digitally gives the benefit of a time stamp as well.

She told me today she's got photos and a journal and that was what let me know she's ready.    Considering how gung ho on drugs law enforcement is, I think her fear of going to jail too is pretty valid. Pretty sure if W doesn't fess up if/when he gets caught, he could pull her down with him. But you say she owns the house? I don't know how involved you want to get in it but maybe if you went over, offered to help get rid of the plants and force him out she would take that final step. If you got rid of all the illegal stuff in the house you could probably also not be so afraid of assistance from the cops if he gets violent. He's keeping her afraid by holding the plants over her head, if there are no plants he's got nothing except for being a violent douche, which the cops can deal with.\n\nMaybe I'm being overly simplistic, but its just what I think I would do in your situation. Thinking it over, I think you're right. The best course of action is getting rid of them. I'll talk it over with her and see if we can make a plan to get him out of the house so I can go over there and help her with it.  Thinking it over, I think you're right.

Step 1 is ditch the bong.  Step 2 is call the cops.  \n\nEven if the bong is still there when the cops arrive, it's a good chance the cops won't care.  Especially when faced with abusive husband.  Ten seconds of witnessing abusive husband's antics and he can scream \"oh yeah well she's got a BONNNNNG!!!\" all he likes -- it won't matter, because the cops see a ragey husband as a much bigger threat than a bong. Having a bong is a lot different than growing.   I understand why people want her to get rid of the plants, but clearly your brother is dangerous and getting rid of the plants while she still lives with him is a bad idea for a whole lot of reasons. I see that she can't abandon her animals, but she will need to get out of there soon and she's gonna need help and shelter from him. Leaving an abusive spouse is dangerous. At least get her to call an abuse victims hotline. Normally the conversation stays confidential and chances are these people have seen enough cases of abuse to know what she can do to get help without having the law backfire on her. \n\nSeriously he's manipulating her via emotional and physical abuse to remain silent about the weed. I can't imagine the law wouldn't take that into acount.    Look on the bright side,\nI just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Gieco.         Out of curiosity, did anyone warn this woman about your brother's history of being emotionally disturbed and abusive behavior *before* she got seriously involved with him?                     If he grows weed in the house and has several plants... why did he need money for weed?\n\n  ",

    "snippet" : "Hi! I am Katie! I am twenty-two years old and have never had a real girlfriend. You know the one who helps braid your hair, have wine and magazine nights, watch rom-coms with heaps of cookie dough and will go to the gym with you the next day ( yes, we will minimally sweat but we are mostly there to oogle and to look great in yoga pants, because let's face it, what woman doesn't look great in yoga pants). Yea, that kind of wonderful relationship you have with another woman who you can share your deepest secrets with and who will always be there to lend a shoulder to cry on. Your soul sister?? It's been my own fault that I don't have any, but I swear I am going to try harder. My biggest fear is that when I get married, I will have no one of consequence to stand by my side. No one who will be there for me through life's trials and to share life with. Tomorrow, I am going to start to be be proactive and make sure that I find some incredible ladies, just like yourselves, to fill my life with all the wonderful 2X I have been craving. In the meantime, I am going to watch a chick flick with a glass of wine and wish you were here next to me. SO!! For all you fantastic ladies who have those gals in their life, please, take a second to tell them how much you appreciate having them for all of us who haven't found ours yet. Cheers!     My best real girl friend has never set foot in a gym (damn her great genes), can't drink wine or caffeine, hates magazines and rom coms and frankly wouldn't know which end of the hair to start braiding. But she's still my best friend and she'll be the one by my side if I get married, even if she does whinge about dress shopping, bitch about me denying her black as a color option and pull faces in every picture. \n\nMy point here is that that wonderful relationship takes many forms and that there are many 2Xs in people and places you'd never expect. Good luck!   I live in a somewhat big city that often times feel like a small town.  [This brief scene](http://i.imgur.com/b2CEs5B.png) from the Simpsons describes it best.  A lot of people have lived there their entire lives and everyone sort of knows everyone.  Tourism is pretty much non-existent and the only reason anyone would move here is because it's cheap to live here.\n\nAnyway, I'm also 22 and the other day I realised that the majority of my best girlfriends are people I've known since grade school.  They are absolutely delightful!  Other than that, I haven't really made any other new friends who are as close with me as some of these ladies.  \n\nI think I might find myself in your shoes in a few months. I have plans to study and work in another province soon, and I'm nervous about starting my social life over again. The new city happens to be very touristy so I'd imagining there will be lots of people coming in and out. It might be hard finding people who will become very close friends, but I'm hopeful! :D  You sound like an awesome young woman and I hope you find what you're looking for :)\n\n\n\nHave a great day !  Hey Knave, \nI don't have that either, one day maybe, but not yet. I guess I wish you lots of luck in finding her! Also, online friends are fun too, if you fancy a chat, do send me a PM! :)\nAlo x Thanks so much for your offer! I hope one day you find your friend too!      Dear god I think I would stab myself in the eye if I ever had that kind of relationship with any of my girlfriends. I hate rom-coms, I go to the gym to actually lift something heavy and work up a sweat and beer is always and forever superior to wine. I understand wanting to have a female friend but you are busy trying to shove your expectations for one into stereotypes of what it should be I am afraid you are going to miss when a true friend comes along.

    "snippet" : "Hi. Longtime lurker here, and I just kind of want to get this off my chest and see if anyone else here ever feels similar to this. Prepare yourself.\n\nAbout a year ago, I got into my first ever relationship. I was 18 (late, I know) with a guy who was one grade younger than me in high school. We had very similar interests and just kind of felt this natural attraction to each other. I liked the emotional bond and told him a lot of very personal stuff about myself that I hadn't told anyone else before. And it was really nice for a while.\n\nThen things started going downhill. He started saying degrading things (telling me I should get a boob job), making fun of things he knew I was sensitive about (I have a large birthmark on my torso and when he didn't believe I had it, I lifted my shirt to show him, and he said, \"It makes you less attractive as a person.\"), and pressuring me for sex. He pressured me a lot. \n\nHe kept asking me how far I would go and would I do oral and could he do oral on me and why don't I just take my shirt off and let him take my bra off and GAHLDKAGHAIargjkhasdfliguh. Please realize, this guy was my first kiss. I was in no way ready for sex. Like, at all. I was not comfortable diving into sexual activity so quickly. And I told him that a lot.\n\nThe day before we broke up, we were hanging out. As I was about to leave, we went to hug. I remember this all so vividly. We hugged and he held me tight, pulled down his pants (briefs included) and started trying to take my pants down. For the briefest second, I just didn't know what to do. I froze up while he laughed and was starting to get his hand in my pants. Then I just punched him in the chest and left. \n\nHe apologized profusely afterwords and played it off like it was a joke and nothing was going to happen. That he did it because he love (and therefore wanted) me so much. And I believed him.\n\nThe next day, he broke up with me via text message and told me that he just didn't have feelings for me anymore but could we still be friends? There was an overwhelming wave of relief and I agreed, because friendship meant I wouldn't be obligated to touch him anymore.\n\nFound out the day after that that he had cheated the entire relationship with a mutual friend. I cut both of them from my life. I was a strong, independent woman *insert snappy fingers here* and I didn't need either of them in my life, no thank you. \n\nBut I keep caving. He keeps trying to talk to me and acts like nothing bad happened. I can't tell if he's being manipulative or if he's just stupid. He keeps telling me how I'm one of the few people in the world he really cares about, but he keeps proving over and over again that it's not true. He objectified me so much while we were together (constantly grabbing at me and telling me to never gain any weight or he wouldn't talk to me). He hurt me the day before we were done and just made me feel so worthless and violated (I downplayed it a lot before that and didn't accept that it was technically sexual assault until quite recently), he asked me for relationship advice when he was officially with the person he cheated on me with. On the anniversary of something very important to me (my darkest secret, which I hadn't told anyone) he didn't say a thing, he never asked me how I was doing. He told me that no one would care about me as much as he did. He told me I wasn't anything without him.\n\nAnd after hearing something often enough, you start to believe it.\n\nI eventually stopped talking to him. Just eased out of it. And I started feeling better. I really did.\n\nThe other day, I went to visit a couple of teachers at my old high school. (I'm trying to turn my life around and I wanted to thank the ones who were especially influential to me.) And I saw him. And I don't know what happened. I got that lump in my throat and felt the burning behind my eyes and the metallic taste in my mouth that always happens before I cry (spoiler: I'm not a crier. The last time I cried was a little over two years ago. I just hate it). Fought it, didn't cry but I was disgusted at how much of a hold he still has over me. So I went to my car and wrote a long, very direct letter to him about how exactly he had hurt me and and why I didn't stay to talk to him. I left it on his porch because I knew he'd get it when he got out of school.\n\nHe got the letter and texted me later, apologizing over and over and he didn't realize he'd impacted me so negatively and I was still so important to him. And he was so, so impossibly sorry.\n\nI know I'm not supposed to forgive him. I know that. But I feel myself caving in.\n\nI HATE how someone who hurt me so much still has such a hold over me. I don't feel any romantic attachment to him anymore, but I feel, I don't know...like I'm going all Stockholm Syndrome in a way.\n\nAs terrible as it is, I hope I'm not the only one who feels like this. I always thought that I was stronger than this. That I wouldn't give in to something like this. That I would never let someone other than myself make me feel so happy and so sad and so wonderful and so awful all at once like he did. That if anyone ever violated me like that, that I'd be strong enough to fight back and never even look at the person again. That I'd never wake up one day and realize, oh, hey, that was sexual assault. That I'd give someone else so much power over me.\n\nI just don't want to be alone.  You're not alone. You're so very far from alone. \n\nThere are a million stories like yours. \n\nI'm just in awe that you defended yourself, and stood up for yourself. No matter how much he's hurt you, no matter how tempted you were to give in, you stood strong, your star shines bright. \n\nDon't let him put out that fire. \n\nHe knows what he did. It's time to let him go. \n\nLove is an addiction. That's not a metaphor. You will want another fix. It will hurt when you don't get it. \n\nBut it can be defeated. There are better things waiting for you.\n\nBelieve in yourself. \n\nMost important, forgive yourself.   Hi OP. I don't really have the words, but I want to tell you that you *are* very strong and brave and I truly respect you for that.\n\nAnd you know what? You *do* have power. You've stood up to him. You've regained control. This *is* your life, and it is going to be awesome, and this terrible person has no power over you because he is nothing, nothing but a shrinking speck in your rear-view mirror.\n\nYou've been nothing but strong. Please don't blame yourself any more.\n\nI just want to let you know that we'll always be here to listen to you. You're definitely not alone. Hi OP. I don't really have the words, but I want to tell you that you *are* very strong and brave and I truly respect you for that.\n\nAnd you know what? You *do* have power. You've stood up to him. You've regained control. This *is* your life, and it is going to be awesome, and this terrible person has no power over you because he is nothing, nothing but a shrinking speck in your rear-view mirror.\n\nYou've been nothing but strong. Please don't blame yourself any more.\n\nI just want to let you know that we'll always be here to listen to you. You're definitely not alone.  Oh goodness, OP. So much of what you wrote sounded like parts of what I went through at 19. I'm amazed that you were able to write him a letter and stand up for yourself like that. It's been a few years since I've talked to my ex (we had kind of a similar relationship to what you're talking about. Things were good for a bit and then he started to degrade me, break me down, sexually assault me and then full on abuse started to happen and rape as well. Then I found out he was cheating on me and took it as my chance to get out) and even though  I'm doing quite well regarding the situation, I don't think I'd be able to do what you did. Even though I don't know you, I'm quite proud of you. :)  \n  \nYou're definitely not the only one who feels like that. This happens to so many people. Just because it happened to you, it doesn't mean you aren't strong. In the end, you didn't let him have power over you. That's what's important. Remember to forgive yourself, be patient with yourself, and even if you aren't completely able to let go of things yet, that's okay. It takes time. I was with my ex when I was 19, and I'm about to turn 22. I still deal with emotional issues stemming from that relationship but it does get better. Keep moving forward and don't let what happened to you take over your life. You're stronger than you think you are. :)   You're not alone. There are a lot of us who aren't born with the strength to do all those things you mentioned. We have to learn how to do those things, even though we want to do them so badly and feel like it should come naturally. You probably realize this, but I just want to remind you that you can forgive him without giving in to him. The choice to forgive and the choice to never look back are not mutually exclusive. Just do the best you can and remember you don't need to accept behavior that makes you feel bad. Take care of yourself. :)  You are not alone and you are not at fault.  \nI went through something very similar in high school. Thinking about it now still makes my lip curl in disgust and it's been over 10 years.\n  \nTry not to be hard on yourself. He was the abuser in this situation and he manipulated you in any way he knew how. None of that was your fault; none of it happened was because you were \"weak.\" Opening yourself to people (family, friends, lovers, etc)  and growing close relationships involves trust. You trust that because someone cares about you, they won't abuse that closeness. This sociopath exploited that relationship and that trust to manipulate and abuse you. And it's not your fault. It's his.\n\nThe way I think about my experience is this: Whatever happened is over. I am stronger and I know myself better now. For better or for worse, that experience made me grow and I know that I will never, ever let anyone treat me like that again. And that in itself is not a bad thing. Thank you. Learning experience, gotta keep perspective. I guess my biggest fault is that I believe people are universally good and that there aren't people who try to take advantage of those around them. (I know there are rapists and murderers but those always seemed somewhat...removed from my own life.) thanks for putting this little blip in my life into perspective in the scheme of things. Assuming the best of people rather than the worst is not a fault, it's a virtue. Don't let this miserable asswipe turn you into a cynic. \n\nYou're an amazing gal. :)",

I also saw no spotting and am getting no PMS symptoms. Before I was on the pill, I was pretty regular every 27 days. \n\nI know Mirena often causes amenorrhea, but is it common for this to happen right out of the gate? Alternatively, is it possible that it just messed up my cycle enough to cause it to be late when I am usually very consistent?\n\nI'm not worried about being pregnant. This is more wishful hoping than anything else.  I have had a mirena for a few years now. No periods since the day I got it.   ",

    "snippet" : "Hey TwoX-ers. I would like input on egg donation. I'm considering selling my eggs to a couple and would love to hear any experiences on the subject. I'm 20 years old and in college, so I have no desire to raise a child right now, but I wasn't sure going into this how I felt about whether I wanted to know them or not. However, the following question on the initial screening survey kind of floored me:\n\n&gt;Do you and your spouse/partner understand that there will be a legal document that will be drafted that there are no parental rights of an egg donor and that after the donation there will be no communication [in] either direction with the intended parents or child in the future?\n\nI don't know how I feel about that. I have no idea how I'll feel knowing there's a little half-me running around who I'll never meet. On one hand, men donate sperm all the time and it never seems to be an issue. On the other hand, it might be a beautiful experience to know this kid. TwoX, what do??  It's the same deal as given up a child for adoption - its basically saying that while you have genetic relation to the kid you have no parental rights. I'm assuming you know the couple, and you can talk that sort of communication out with them, but it's a way to protect the parents from you trying to reclaim the kid later. It also protects you from them trying to coerce responsibility out of you. \n\n No, I responded to a request for egg donors, we haven't met yet. I understand the legality of it, I just don't know how I feel about never having the option to meet and maybe hang out with super cool lil-me. :/ Well that's extremely generous of you! \n\nIf you're iffy on the subject I'm sure the fertility clinic orchestrating this has a counseler of some sort to explain it all to you. It's a really big decision for sure! (equally tough for men too, sperm donors are more common than egg donors, but are still rare compared to the entire population. Most guys I know are against it for the same reasons you're iffy) You might be able to reach and talk to the couple if the clinic allows it, it varies by location IIRC. Most clinics also have a clause were the resulting child is able to look you up when s/he is 18, if you want that option. \n\nI'd suggest going to r/adoption and asking questions there, since emotionally it's fairly similar. Might help! \n\nAnd as someone who will need a donor to have kids, thanks so much for at least considering it. It's a pretty big thing. ",

    "snippet" : "**EDIT**: *Thanks to those that responded!  Went to the doc and I'm fine.  She said she generally tells people not to worry about the strings because sometimes they coil up into the cervix, but my placement was perfect.  I got a sonogram and that was pretty nifty, actually.  Just got a little freaked because in the Mirena pamphlet it instructs you to do a monthly check for the strings and to contact your doctor if you can't feel them anymore.*\n\nNo worries, I am calling the gynecologist as soon as they open (I'm up way too early), but I'm anxious and having trouble finding answers on the internet.\n\nSo, it feels like the strings have gotten shorter...which means either they have shrunken (although I've had it for 7-8 months, so I don't think it'd still be shrinking) or Mirena has moved farther up into my cervix.  I can hardly feel the strings, if at all.  I can brush the very tips if I push my finger up against the opening of my cervix.  I'm not in any pain so I don't think it perforating anything.  I'd know if that was the case, right? \n\nIf Mirena has moved up into my cervix, can the OBGYN pull it back out into it's proper place?  If so, is this process painful?  I really love having Mirena and not having to worry about birth control or periods, but I dunno if I want to withstand the pain of having my cervix stretched and adjust to a foreign object again.  \n\nAnyone that has experience with this, please share!  Thank you!  Having it checked by your doctor is a good idea.  That said, the length of the strings can vary a lot during your cycle, so what you might be feeling is just normal variation.\n\nHere's a link to the Beautiful Cervix Project with [photos of a woman with an IUD] (http://www.beautifulcervix.com/cervix-photo-galleries/age-25-entire-cycle-with-iud/) (nsfw, cervix pictures, obviously).

    "title" : "I hate my job and have the opportunity to quit and be a \"home manager,\" but it feels wrong",
    "snippet" : "Hey ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI find myself in a fairly stressful job situation.  I used to love my job but a new manager came in and has made the job very stressful to the point of me wanting to quit. I've already threatened to quit once, but she said that things will settle down after the transition period smooths over and convinced me to stay. \n\nIt's been almost a month since then and things haven't really changed much. Going to work is now a huge struggle every morning and my anxiety level is pretty high once I get there. \n\nI've talked it over with my husband, who is encouraging me to leave the stressful situation that I'm in and instead stay home and take care of the house. He says I am noticeably happier on days that I am home taking care of things around the house and it feels that way too. We would save at least $100 a week in transportation costs, save on food costs (we order in at least about 3-4 nights a week), eat healthier, and have a nice, tidy place to be living in. \n\nBut I wasn't raised that way. Even though we can afford for me to not work as a couple, it just feels like it goes against everything I was raised to be. While both my husband and I would be very happy to be a homemaker, I don't feel entirely comfortable being completely dependent on him because then I would be at a loss should anything happen to him. \n\nWe don't have kids yet, so most of the things I would be doing would be general house stuff and taking care of our dog. We've talked about sending me back to school full time, but I'm scared of paying that much money ($116k in tuition over 2.5 years) to go back to school. If I continue the job I'm at for another year, they will pay for part of my tuition, but that entails staying at a job I hate for another year. \n\nI also just feel very spoiled and entitled because I understand that a lot of people hate their job but continue on because most people aren't really in the fortunate financial situation we are in. \n\nIt doesn't help that I have clinical depression so making decisions is very difficult for me. \n\nWhile the ultimate decision will be up to me, what would you do if you were in my shoes, 2x?\n\nTL;DR: hate my job, would love to stay home and become a homemaker, but I feel conflicted because I fear losing my independence.   If you already have depression, I would be careful about quitting your job and staying at home because it will leave you a LOT more time for thinking. If you have any tendency towards depressive spirals of thought (I know I do, &amp; I'm not depressed), coupled with the fact that you have doubts about the 'morality' of your decision make having too much time on your hands a dicey prospect. Are you seeing a counsellor? could you talk to him/her about the possible effects of this?\n\nAnecdote time! ;) I've been out of work since November &amp; am not really looking for work because I'm basically waiting for my partner to finish his job &amp; then we're getting the hell out of here. As in your case, financially it's OK, but it feels really weird. I have a degree &amp; have never seen myself as the 'homemaker' type, at least not without kids as a reason to do it, so it's a pretty strange situation for me. &amp; it's not easy. I have way too much time on my hands, and even Reddit doesn't manage to occupy me for all of it! &amp; then my SO comes home &amp; asks about my day &amp; I confess to having spent all of it on the internet - neither of us feels great about that... So to 'justify my oxygen consumption' (my dad's phrase) I clean &amp; cook &amp; do laundry &amp; fix socks, &amp; I'm studying a bit.\n\nTL;DR if it's your job that's the problem, can you look for a new one, instead of just quitting &amp; staying home? Even if you have enough for now, more money is a good cushion to have in these 'troubled time'.

Even if you have enough for now, more money is a good cushion to have in these 'troubled time'. I would second this, and I would also add that being depressed *makes you* not enjoy things you did before and want to contract your life and do less and stay home more and it's almost *always* a bad idea. One of the hallmarks of depression is rumination, and having too much time on your hands to think about things is about the most dangerous place to be if your depressed. Quitting a job is often the start of a spiral into doing less and less, leaving the house less and less, being involved in less activities and hobbies, and feeling worse and worse until just getting up feels like a struggle. \n\nKeeping occupied is really important in depression so if you hate your job that much then try to find a new job, but please don't end up spending all day at home. \n\nAlso, everyone else's comments about not being financially dependent on someone else are really good points. Trying to get back into the workforce after a significant gap is really hard, and you risk finding yourself financially in real trouble down the track. \n\nI think your mental and financial health are both better served by remaining independent and in work.    If you are happier on the days you get to stay home and take care of your house, do it. Please do not waste away at a job you despise because you feel bad for the people who have to keep a shitty job. Like wackyvorlon said, if you find you don't enjoy being a homemaker, you can find another job.\nIf I were in your situation I would absolutely stay home, but that's because I've always wanted to be a stay at home mother. It may not be your thing, but you'll never know until you give it a try. I think my fear is that if I decide to get back into the job market, that the gap in employment would look bad. I am also scared of not being respected for not having a real job and not having anything productive to show for my days home. \n\nI guess feminism is truly about being empowered to do what you want, even if it means staying at home and taking care of business at home. I don't know why I can't wrap my mind around that part of feminism.  I think my fear is that if I decide to get back into the job market, that the gap in employment would look bad.

    "snippet" : "I'm not sure how to start this post, but it basically involves a fight between me and my boyfriend that ended extremely badly.\n\nA few days ago, we were fighting about something stupid. He was pretty much just complaining that I kept trying to bring him along to events that he doesn't care about, etc. It's necessary to know that my boyfriend is a veteran and was in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq. He ended up getting badly burned on one side of his body, including his face. So one side of his face is scarred up pretty badly, and he's sensitive about his appearance.\n\nWe were arguing about nothing, and it ended up getting pretty heated. He basically accused of me of trying to ruin his life, and I ended up calling him an: \"ugly mother fucker.\" When I said that, he just stopped talking and looked at the ground. I tried to apologize and I kept asking him to talk to me, but he just kept staring at the floor for like a minute or two.\n\nEventually, he looked up at me with this betrayed look, and tears in his eyes, and said: \"*You're the one person I trusted to never call me that.*\" He then got up and walked out of my house. It's been two days now and he still wont answer my texts or phone calls. I've pretty much just been sitting at home crying and feeling like the most horrible person who ever lived.\n\nWhat can I do? I feel so bad and I'm so scared that this will end our relationship. What can I do if he wont talk to me? Has anyone ever said something horrible that they've regretted before? I'm just at a loss for what to do now. I'd do anything to take back what I've said. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? Help, please.\n  I've been on the receiving end of this kind of comment before - and I'm not an attractive person.  I'm ugly, I'm short, I'm fat, and I have a weird body shape.  I've lived most of my life with people making fun of me, calling me names, telling me I'm ugly.  Before I say anything else, *none* of this is meant to make you feel worse.  I get that you feel horrible already, but perhaps it's helpful to get perspective from the other side.  \n\nThis kind of comment just rips you down, tears you apart, and undoes any progress towards *not* feeling like you're a hideous freak.  I know that's not comforting, but it's important to be honest about this.  \n\nHave I forgiven people who've said this to me?  YES.  Do I hate them?  NO.  Do I hold it against them?  **NO**.  It was said in anger, during a fight, and I *know* that this isn't how the person who said it feels.  I *know* they do not consider me to be a truly ugly, horrible person.  \n\nBut you know what sticks?  The fact that even though the fight had *NOTHING* to do with my appearance whatsoever, the person chose to *make it* about my appearance because he was mad, and he knew that would hurt.  I don't believe he planned to do that, or knew exactly how deeply that would hurt me... but it was said.  It hurts.  Two years later, it *still* hurts.  To this day, I find it really difficult to believe any compliments regarding my appearance are honest, even though I *know* they are honest and completely heartfelt.  I know I'm ugly, and even the most innocuous \"oh, huckflen, you look nice!\" can make me feel like absolute and utter shit.  \n\nThat said... you *are NOT* the most horrible person who ever lived.  You're a human being who got really mad and said some shit you didn't mean, and it deeply hurt someone you care about.  He's understandably very upset.  \n\nWhat can you do if he won't talk to you?  Don't push it too much.  If you really need to explain some things and he refuses to interact, you can go ahead &amp; try a letter.  Just realize that things like this are *very* hard for people who truly aren't attractive or have physical imperfections/scars.  You probably called out the one thing that bothers him the most about himself, and that's really painful.  \n\nThat said... don't try to sit there and tell him he's beautiful or perfect.  Don't try to pretend the disfigurement doesn't exist.  All you do in saying things like this is make him feel like his pain is invalid because you're pretending it's not real.  That is NOT helpful.  If anything, acknowledge that what you said was horrible, wrong, and that you didn't mean it, but don't backpedal and try to say he's actually beautiful.  That *will not help*.  \n\nBe honest.  Spill your guts.  And realize that it's possible he may not want to continue the relationship.  You are not a horrible, evil person, though.  \n\nGood people do horrible things.  Smart people do stupid things.  A single action does not make you an awful person - it means you did something awful.  (((hugs))) I have a great deal of scars, and have had insecurities in the past regarding them. My SO knows this. He truly finds me beautiful, regardless. It's very encouraging for me.\n\n&gt; I find it really difficult to believe any compliments regarding my appearance are honest.\n\nHowever, if my SO called me ugly, I would have exactly that problem, and it *would* be a deal-breaker for me. My perception of him is that he is honest, kind, and caring. If he called me ugly, particularly with reference to my scars, I would no longer believe he found me beautiful and would begin to question my perception of him.\n\nWhen I am angry at my SO, I can say hurtful things. However, they are never out of the blue; they are always things that have been bothering me and well up at that point. I expect the same from him, and would certainly suspect he had been dishonest if he flung such an insult at me.\n\nIf arguments happen that actually elicit random insults for the sake of hurting the other, then I agree with cathline; counseling is necessary. I would almost certainly not be able to feel comfortable with someone who tore me down like that, regardless of the circumstances. Well, that's the thing... we're all so different.  We all have different limits and we all handle things in our own ways.  It wasn't a deal-breaker for me because I *am* ugly, but I absolutely, completely understand how it could be a deal-breaker for someone else.  \n\nAs far as my statement goes... I find it hard to believe *any* compliment from *anyone*, ever.  I'm ugly, not blind.  If someone says something nice to me, my first reaction is to wonder why they're making fun of me, even though they probably aren't.  A lifetime of being treated like shit will do that to you. =) \n\nI'm usually a pent-up kind of person, too.  And it's usually stupid shit that I blow *way* out of proportion - I'm the first to admit that I do this on occasion.  I certainly don't make a habit of it, though, and I don't go out of my way to say hurtful things.  If I happen to say something that *is* hurtful, I'm going to beat myself up for days over it because I'll feel like shit that I hurt you, even if I don't *like* you.  That's just the kind of person I am.  I never, ever want to make anyone else feel bad - even my abusive ex-husband.  And that's saying something - he is a huge asshole!  \n\nI think if there's a pattern of this behavior, or if someone goes completely out of their way to intentionally hurt someone like this, and does *not* feel remorse... counseling is definitely something to seriously consider.  \n\nBut for the 2x community to tell OP she absolutely needs therapy, or that is a horrible person... we don't know that and we shouldn't tell her that.  She fucked up and she knows it - no need to rub her face in it, ya know?   I've been on the receiving end of this kind of comment before - and I'm not an attractive person.

OP has been getting a lot of angry, hateful comments from people telling her she's a shitty person, but I don't agree with that sentiment.  She didn't come here to get yelled at by an angry mob, she came here because she feels lost and doesn't know what to do... and since I've unfortunately been in the shoes of \"hey, you ugly fuck!\" before, I figured it was worth tossing in my two cents, so to speak.  =)   I've been on the receiving end of this kind of comment before - and I'm not an attractive person.  I'm ugly, I'm short, I'm fat, and I have a weird body shape.  I've lived most of my life with people making fun of me, calling me names, telling me I'm ugly.  Before I say anything else, *none* of this is meant to make you feel worse.  I get that you feel horrible already, but perhaps it's helpful to get perspective from the other side.  \n\nThis kind of comment just rips you down, tears you apart, and undoes any progress towards *not* feeling like you're a hideous freak.  I know that's not comforting, but it's important to be honest about this.  \n\nHave I forgiven people who've said this to me?  YES.  Do I hate them?  NO.  Do I hold it against them?  **NO**.  It was said in anger, during a fight, and I *know* that this isn't how the person who said it feels.  I *know* they do not consider me to be a truly ugly, horrible person.  \n\nBut you know what sticks?  The fact that even though the fight had *NOTHING* to do with my appearance whatsoever, the person chose to *make it* about my appearance because he was mad, and he knew that would hurt.  I don't believe he planned to do that, or knew exactly how deeply that would hurt me... but it was said.  It hurts.  Two years later, it *still* hurts.  To this day, I find it really difficult to believe any compliments regarding my appearance are honest, even though I *know* they are honest and completely heartfelt.  I know I'm ugly, and even the most innocuous \"oh, huckflen, you look nice!\" can make me feel like absolute and utter shit.  \n\nThat said... you *are NOT* the most horrible person who ever lived.  You're a human being who got really mad and said some shit you didn't mean, and it deeply hurt someone you care about.  He's understandably very upset.  \n\nWhat can you do if he won't talk to you?  Don't push it too much.  If you really need to explain some things and he refuses to interact, you can go ahead &amp; try a letter.  Just realize that things like this are *very* hard for people who truly aren't attractive or have physical imperfections/scars.  You probably called out the one thing that bothers him the most about himself, and that's really painful.  \n\nThat said... don't try to sit there and tell him he's beautiful or perfect.  Don't try to pretend the disfigurement doesn't exist.  All you do in saying things like this is make him feel like his pain is invalid because you're pretending it's not real.  That is NOT helpful.  If anything, acknowledge that what you said was horrible, wrong, and that you didn't mean it, but don't backpedal and try to say he's actually beautiful.  That *will not help*.  \n\nBe honest.  Spill your guts.  And realize that it's possible he may not want to continue the relationship.  You are not a horrible, evil person, though.  \n\nGood people do horrible things.  Smart people do stupid things.  A single action does not make you an awful person - it means you did something awful.

(((hugs)))   Have you thought that he might not like to go to these events due to his scarring?\n\nIf my face was badly scarred public events wouldn't be my favorite things to do.   I'd just like to point out that all these \"get counseling\" suggestions seem like a huge overreaction.\n\nEveryone, including the people who suggested this in the first place, have a vindictive nature to them, and it gets brought out when we're angry. It's normal. This is why arguing when you're angry is such a terrible idea. You'll say something terrible that you'll regret.\n\nI don't think you or most other people require anything more than self-reflection to solve this problem.

No. Have you ever tried arguing when you're not even slightly mad? That's impossible. Even if I am terribly upset, I would never say something I'd regret later. I think before I talk. And I'm quite sure that calling names is something you should forget when puberty ends, it's just not a mature thing to do. &gt;Even if I am terribly upset, I would never say something I'd regret later.\n\nWell, you're one of very, very few. Few enough that I don't really believe you.\n\n&gt;I think before I talk.\n\nYeah, well, go ride your high horse someplace else.\n\n&gt;And I'm quite sure that calling names is something you should forget when puberty ends, it's just not a mature thing to do.\n\nYou're one of those people who thinks their greatest flaw is \"works too hard,\" aren't you? No, I'm very introverted and I really care about people, that combination is helpful in this case. But I think I can sleep well even if you don't believe me. &gt;No, I'm very introverted and I really care about people,\n\nIs this meant to imply that anyone who loses their temper doesn't really care about people? No, it does not. But I am not one of those people. It's a bless and a curse. I sometimes wish I could show my happiness better  your comment is just as much about *why* you said what you did than just what you said. you may not truly feel what you said, but in that moment you intentionally said something with the sole purpose of hurting him deeply. and what's worse, you went the lowest road possible. you made a comment about something you know he stuggles with and is incredibly insecure about. and it had nothing to do with the argument at hand. you essentially threw salt on an unhealed wound, and did so as an ambush.\n\ngive him his space. i would want nothing to do with you for a while too. but he will talk to you eventually.\n\nif he takes you back, you are walking on eggshells. you will have to work very hard to earn back his trust and help him rebuild his self esteem. **your relationship will not be the same after this**. your comment will always follow you both around. sometimes it will be close behind you and sometimes it will be in the distance. but it will never go away.\n\nif he decides to leave you, you will both have some serious demons to overcome. for him, finding a way to regain his confidence and trust in others. for you, you will have to mature and grow as a person. comments like the one you made are petty and cripplingly hurtful. no matter how \"heated\" you get, there is no excuse to say something like that.\n\nbest of luck. agreed.  The comment will linger.. For a loooong time.  \n\nI have narcolepsy.  My husband made a comment YEARS ago... Not even a particularly mean or hurtful comment... but it still brings me to tears.  The words made me feel more alone than anything else.  Out of everyone in my life I always thought that he would be the one to understand what I go through with my narc.  The comment left me lonely, vulnerable, feeling like I was far from normal....broken.\nPretty sure that's how your boyfriend feels... but probably compounded given the circumstances of his injuries.  \nSorry to say... But you REALLY screwed that one up hon.  (I know you get that now)\nIt's going to take a whole hell of a lot for him to move past those words.  I hope one day he's truly able to do so.  \n\n  I'm so sorry.  You can't unring the bell, and he can't un-hear what you said.  He probably thinks that it's what you've secretly felt all along, and anger made you betray it.\n\nWrite a serious apology, where you make no excuses.  Make it under one page, because he'll throw away a long one before he reads it.  Make it about him, not about you.  Be clear that you understand that he owes you nothing, not even a response, but that you wanted him to know that you would give anything to take back those angry words.  \n\nTape it to his door.  Walk away.  \n\nAnd then you just have to wait.  You can text him once a day, max.  Do not pester. And, oh please, do not call him when you've been drinking.  If he talks to you again, you will need ALL your brain functioning. \n\nYou can't undo what you said: you can only make sure you take the high road from here.  Stay strong.  \n How do I convince him that I didn't really mean it?  I'm sure he thinks that I've always thought he was ugly now.\n\nI honestly don't care about his scars.  He's still beautiful in my eyes.  In the heat of the moment I just wanted to hurt him and that's what popped into my head.  I'm far from perfect, myself.  I could definitely stand to lose a few pounds.\n\nI feel like it's almost one of those things that you can't take back.  I'm sure he thinks that I've always found him ugly, but that's absolutely not the case.  His scars aren't even that bad.  Is there a way to phrase it to make it more convincing?

Are you sure you didn't mean it? It's time for some self-reflection, honey. Because either a) you did kinda mean it or b) you can be really, really mean. You can grow out of this if you take the time to work on yourself. If you believe he is beautiful, make it so clear to your mind that you can't even think the opposite.

If a guy called a girl a slut and then he tried this, we would advise her to get a restraining order because he won't leave her alone.  \n\nShe needs to get counseling to learn better.    &gt; I feel so bad and I'm so scared that this will end our relationship.\n\nHonestly, it probably will.  This is not the kind of shit you can really apologize for or make amends for.  If I was your boyfriend, I would never be able to get this out of my mind.  You can't \"take this back\" because the idea that you would say such a thing in the first place would always loom large in my mind. \n\nI think your best is, instead of trying to salvage this relationship (you probably can't) is to get some kind of therapeutic help and try to figure out what would motivate you to say this kind of thing.   I agree that this is one of those things you can't take back.  Despite his disfigurement, your boyfriend thought you could look at him and see the person he is inside and not the physical outside.  Now you've basically blown that illusion.  He knows you see the outside like everyone else.\n\nTo my mind, your best hope is to tell him that things are not the way he thinks.  That you said what you said because you knew it would hurt him and you wanted to hurt him in that moment, but it's not how you really feel.  I don't know if you can ever be 'special' in his eyes again, but if you can, that's the route I'd go. I agree that this is one of those things you can't take back.

I disagree. \n\nIt might end the relationship, it might not. Most relationships have at least one instance of one or both partners saying something really very hurtful. \n\nIf everything else in the relationship is fairly good and the guilty party is genuinely sorry and apologetic, often the other partner can forgive and the two can make amends.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how this will go based solely on OP's description, though obviously her  boyfriend was pretty deeply hurt by this. I agree that therapy for OP (at least) might help her deal with her anger if this is a common occurence, and it sounds like her boyfriend might benefit from it, too (if he's not already in it), since he's probably got a lot to deal with from his experience and scarring. I don't see why the boyfriend needs therapy.  He seems fine.  She said basically the most horrible thing she could have said to him, and he took it pretty well.  I think anybody in that situation would have reacted the way he did.  I know we're always supposed to take the OP's side in TwoX, but to say that the boyfriend needs therapy is insulting in my opinion.  The only thing a therapist could say to him is \"find people who love you for who you are and not your appearance\" and his girlfriend betrayed that.  &gt;I don't see why the boyfriend needs therapy. He seems fine.\n\nOP's post:\n&gt;my boyfriend is a veteran and was in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq. He ended up getting badly burned on one side of his body, including his face. So one side of his face is scarred up pretty badly, and he's sensitive about his appearance.\n\nTypically an experience like that will cause some psychological damage, as will living with burn scars. He might be fine, he might be fine after having had some therapy, or he might benefit from (more) therapy if he's still working through his feelings on what happened to him and coping with having visible burn scars.\n\nFor this case, I don't think his reaction to what OP said was wrong. I was just suggesting therapy more generally to help him cope with his feelings and a traumatic event. &gt; Typically an experience like that will cause some psychological damage, as will living with burn scars. \n\nThe OP said nothing about him having any psychological damage, so you are just speculating about whether or not he needs therapy.  Also, do you really expect the OP to go to her boyfriend and say \"hey, you know how I said basically the most fucked up, evil, thing I could possibly say to you?  Yeah, well, I think YOU need therapy.\"   &gt; Typically an experience like that will cause some psychological damage, as will living with burn scars. \n\nThe OP said nothing about him having any psychological damage, so you are just speculating about whether or not he needs therapy.  Also, do you really expect the OP to go to her boyfriend and say \"hey, you know how I said basically the most fucked up, evil, thing I could possibly say to you?  Yeah, well, I think YOU need therapy.\"   &gt;so you are just speculating about whether or not he needs therapy.\n\nHold up...did you not just say to OP:\n\n&gt;I think your best is...to get some kind of therapeutic help and try to figure out what would motivate you to say this kind of thing.\n\nHow can you be possibly say that seeking therapy for insulting someone deeply is somehow more valid than seeking therapy for having very deep, trauma-related confidence issues? I have no idea why you think that's any less speculative than what MeloJelo said. \n\nYou say you don't want to \"take sides\", and essentially that's exactly what you're doing. Just because it's not the \"default\" side that you seem to think is usually abided by doesn't matter. The information we have to work with is *always* going to be one-sided and prone to speculations. \n\nI think it's actually pretty insulting to tell someone who's obviously very guilty, remorseful, and at a loss for what to do that they need therapy...you're acting like her insulting him means she has some disturbed personality or something...please. Most people will say something they don't mean in the heat of the moment at some point in their lives. Sorry if you're unable to relate to that.\n\nI think it's possible OP can't salvage her relationship, and that's an unfortunate thing when it comes down to it. I feel bad for the boyfriend because I can't imagine having the one person you trust treat you that way, it could very well be something he can't accept. But it does suck, because OP obviously hates herself for it too, and sometimes not being able to forgive *yourself* can be a huge emotional burden too. \n\n &gt; How can you be possibly say that seeking therapy for insulting someone deeply is somehow more valid than seeking therapy for having very deep, trauma-related confidence issues?\n\nThere is no evidence her boyfriend has confidence issues.  She said an extremely fucked up thing and he reacted much better than the average person would have reacted.  If somebody said \"You're a fucking bitch and I hope you die\" I doubt anybody would say you have \"confidence issues\" if you get upset.  \n\nAnd it's not \"speculative\" that OP needs therapy.  She said an extremely hurtful thing that served no good purpose than to hurt and tear a hole in his heart.  Anybody who would say that kind of thing has some kind of issue they are working th ough.  \n\n&gt; I think it's actually pretty insulting to tell someone who's obviously very guilty, remorseful, and at a loss for what to do that they need therapy\n\nSo if a man came on here and said he beat his wife half to death but he was \"guilty and remorseful\" you wouldn't think that guy needed help?  Noted. \n\n&gt; you're acting like her insulting him means she has some disturbed personality or something...please.\n\nYes I do think she has a disturbed personality.  I've known only a few people in my life that have said things like that, and they've all problems.  I don't think you understand the gravity of the thing and how it takes a certain kind of vicious person to say that kind of thing.  That's not a normal insult you throw around in a fight.  I would honestly put that insult on the same level as calling a black man a \"nigger\" or threatening to kill somebody.  &gt; How can you be possibly say that seeking therapy for insulting someone deeply is somehow more valid than seeking therapy for having very deep, trauma-related confidence issues?\n\nThere is no evidence her boyfriend has confidence issues.

Noted.\n\nSomeone who doesn't see anything wrong with the harm they cause to another person needs therapy. Someone who acts very harshly but displays guilt likely does not. But thank you for equating verbally insulting/abusing someone to nearly physically killing them...I have nothing to say about that. \n\nBut if hypothetical and analogies are your thing, how about this - When OP's boyfriend was serving, what if he killed people? Should he be forgiven for that because it was in the name of...what, freedom? You paint him as completely faultless and victimized while OP as needing to be...rehabilitated, in a sense. I think he *has* been victimized and *nobody* deserves to be treated that way, but I really have trouble painting OP as a disturbed, guiltless, horrible human being. That's all I'm gonna say.  &gt; But if hypothetical and analogies are your thing, how about this - When OP's boyfriend was serving, what if he killed people?\n\nJesus Christ, this is why I hate arguing with left wing people.  His military service in no way justifies what she did to him and is totally irrelevant to this discussion.  &gt; But if hypothetical and analogies are your thing, how about this - When OP's boyfriend was serving, what if he killed people?\n\nJesus Christ, this is why I hate arguing with left wing people.

His military service in no way justifies what she did to him and is totally irrelevant to this discussion.  I don't see why the boyfriend needs therapy.  He seems fine.  She said basically the most horrible thing she could have said to him, and he took it pretty well.  I think anybody in that situation would have reacted the way he did.  I know we're always supposed to take the OP's side in TwoX, but to say that the boyfriend needs therapy is insulting in my opinion.  The only thing a therapist could say to him is \"find people who love you for who you are and not your appearance\" and his girlfriend betrayed that.  He said one of the most horrible things I could imagine my boyfriend saying to me. \"You are ruining my life\". How is that not terrible, unhealthy and childish? She said something terrible also, but who wouldn't get terrible insulted by their partner when accused of something like that. Too bad she couldn't hold it back, but really. &gt; He said one of the most horrible things I could imagine my boyfriend saying to me. \"You are ruining my life\". \n\nWell we don't know the context for that statement - she may be doing some awful things to him.  Also, he didn't literally say that, OP said he said \"He basically accused of me of trying to ruin his life.\"  So we don't know what he really said.         I'm going to try to be nice here and not let you know what I really want to say to you, but maybe this will teach you to think harder about the words that come out of your mouth.\n\nHe deserves to be with someone who respects the sacrifices he made, the pain he had to endure, and the scars he has to carry around for the rest of his life.

I often agree with you, cathline, but this isn't a situation where we're on the same page. \n\nPeople snap when they're upset and say horrible, hurtful, *mean* things - and I don't think that kind of thing is something that automatically means you're mentally screwed up to the point of needing therapy.  \n\nWas she wrong?  Absolutely!  It was wrong, and horrible, and she knows it.  But haven't *you* snapped and said something really hurtful in a fight, at some point in your life?  Almost everyone has.  \n\nI don't think it's helpful to just beat it into OP that she's a horrible person, though.  Perfectly wonderful people do stupid, horrible things sometimes.  Doing something horrible doesn't always mean you're a bad person, it just means you made a horrible mistake.  \n\nUnless OP has a history of doing this kind of thing, I wouldn't say it's helpful to be quite this harsh.  Yes, she was wrong, no excuses for that - but does that have to put her into the \"you are a bad person and you should feel bad\" category?

Yes, she was wrong, no excuses for that - but does that have to put her into the \"you are a bad person and you should feel bad\" category?   No, I haven't said anything this hurtful to anyone I love.  Ever.\n\nI also never slapped a baby, even once.  \n\nI also never drove drunk a single time.\n\nThere are lot of things in life that not everyone has done at least one time.  I'm a huge proponent of trying out new things, but I don't include hurting someone in that.\n\n\nShe knows that she made a mistake and I said that she needs to learn from that mistake.  She needs to learn how to keep from repeating that mistake and how to communicate more effectively.  That isn't telling her that she is a bad person.  \n\nAs for saying that he deserves better - we quite often advise women who are belittled by their SO that they deserve better.  This is no different.  He deserves a relationship where he knows he is safe.  Just like she deserves a relationship where she knows she is safe.  \n\n Well, that's the thing... how do you *know* you've never said something this hurtful to another person?  Unfortunately, we can't ever know exactly how our words impact other people because we aren't them.  \n\nSomething that seems completely innocuous to you might be exceptionally hurtful to another person.  That's part of the problem with humans - we're emotional creatures and we're all *very* different.  I believe that you've never intentionally hurt another person but I can't believe that you can be 100000% sure you've never done it without trying - it's just kind of not possible unless you never interact with another person.  =)  \n\nI agree, she needs to figure out a way to *not* do this again.  I don't think it absolutely has to mean the end of her relationship, though.  And I don't think it means she needs therapy or that OP &amp; her dude can't regain a good, healthy relationship.  \n\nIf people are able to work through infidelity or physical abuse - and many do - surely they can work through an over-heated verbal altercation that causes deep emotional pain.  =)  Not everyone is able to \"work through\" infidelity, and no one SHOULD \"work through\" physical abuse.  Physical abuse is an instant relationship-ender.  If any SO of mine ever as much as lays a finger on me in an abusive way, I'm walking out - right then and there.  Same for infidelity; if any SO of mine is ever unfaithful, I'm walking out.\n\nI would class what the OP did as equally unforgivable.  She knew full well that he was disfigured and sensitive about his appearance.  It wasn't an innocent mistake - she knew what she was doing.  Even if she didn't know the extent of his sensitivity about his appearance, anyone with an ounce of common sense should be able to see the disfigurement and understand that one just Does Not Go There, even in an argument.  I'd class this in the same category as physical abuse - a relationship-ender.  \n\nI know for sure that I've never done that to another human being, btw, let alone a lover.  I may have ACCIDENTALLY said something hurtful WITHOUT KNOWING that the other person was sensitive about that issue - I'm not omniscient and I don't read minds.  But I have never DELIBERATELY said something so awfully hurtful to someone.  I'm thinking about my girlfriend now and the things she's sensitive about - I can't even imagine saying something hurtful to her that would hit those issues.  Eek.   I'm not advocating abuse, dude.  I was *in* an abusive marriage with a psycho who wouldn't even let me see my family.  I *don't* think abuse is okay, and I'm certainly not implying that at all.  That said, I actually do know people whose relationships went downhill, became abusive, and those people were able to *fix* the problem and the abuse did not return.  Is it normal?  No.  But it *does* happen.  \n\nBut this all goes back to my point - we're all *very* different.  What you consider a dealbreaker might not be what the person right next to you considers a dealbreaker, know what I mean?  Some people dig open relationships, some of us prefer to remain with one person, and we'd be utterly ruined if our spouse/SO had sex with someone else.  I would.  I'm *totally* not okay with poly relationships for myself, but I respect those who dig them as long as they're respectful to the others involved.  \n\nIt takes all kinds.   Well,but that said, the OP's boyfriend doesn't want to forgive her.  Everyone is different, so he's allowed to have that reaction, right?\n\nAs for abuse, I wish more people thought of it as a dealbreaker right away - there would be a lot less people stuck in horrible abusive relationships, or dead, if this were the case. We don't know that he doesn't want to forgive her.  All we know is he left, and they haven't spoken since.  \n\nFor all we know, he just wants some space before they talk about it.  Or maybe he's done.  The fact is, we're not part of their relationship, so we *don't* know what he wants, or the finer details of what really happened.  We can judge and advise and try to support OP (or tear her a new one, as most of this thread is doing), but the fact remains, we don't know jack.  \n\nI understand why abuse is tolerated for a lot of people.  Often, it's not like someone just switches from being super to suddenly beating the shit out of you, or treating you like crap verbally/emotionally.  It's *slow*.  They very slowly tear you down and make you think you're wrong, make you believe that you are a worthless piece of shit.  It's not overnight.  \n\nI was with my abusive ex for about 10 years, and I didn't realize until the *last year* we were together that he was abusive.  Why?  Because it was a very slow manipulation, and it built over a very long period of time.  It wasn't until the day he forbid me from seeing *my MOM* that I realized what he was doing wasn't okay.  It wasn't okay that he screamed at me for hours every day, told me I was a worthless piece of shit, that no one loved me, that I'd never be anything.  It wasn't okay that he refused to let me have friends, and that I wasn't allowed to go hang out with his friends because I 'didn't fit in' with them - though in reality, he was fucking at least one of those friends for years, and that's probably why he forbade me from interacting with them.  \n\nMy point is... so very often, by the time you realize it is an abusive situation, you're in way deeper than you knew, and it's not something where you can just walk away.  Even though it *is* a dealbreaker for most people, it's not always something you can just escape quickly.   Well, but there is always a first incident.  Slow manipulation or fast manipulation, there is always a first time that your SO treats you badly.  It may not be huge - it may be \"just\" calling you names in the heat of argument, or \"just\" looking at you in disgust and asking you whether you REALLY need that cheesecake, or \"just\" throwing a fit when you want to see your friends.  If you walk out the first time this happens, you save yourself from a lifetime of abuse.\n\nWill one incident like this always lead to a lifetime of abuse?  Of course not.  Some relationships may very well be reparable.  But there's no way to know what kind of relationship you're in ahead of time.  It may be the one that leads to a lifetime of abuse.  You really don't know.\n\nI love my girlfriend a lot, and she is a wonderful human being.  I don't think there's any risk of her being mean to me or abusing me in any way.  But should an incident like that happen, I am walking out.  I won't stick around and wait for another incident.  I will walk out - even if we'd spent years together, even if there are kids involved, no matter what.  Because I do not deserve to be treated badly in my own home.  My home, and my relationship, are supposed to be a place of refuge and a place of peace.  I trust my girlfriend to be kind to me and to love me.  If that trust is ever broken, I am walking out.  \n\nI really really wish this were taught in schools, and I really really wish that people were taught to internalize this zero-tolerance policy to badness in relationship.  I've had to comfort a friend who was abused in a relationship, and who chose to \"forgive\" a physical attack that left her with permanent damage.  I wish she could have just left him after that physical attack rather than stick around for more badness.   Well, that's the thing... how do you *know* you've never said something this hurtful to another person?  Unfortunately, we can't ever know exactly how our words impact other people because we aren't them.  \n\nSomething that seems completely innocuous to you might be exceptionally hurtful to another person.

From the feedback i have received from my friends and lovers - that is how I know.  \n\nThe big difference is she deliberately said this to hurt him.  She admits it.  It wasn't an accident.  It wasn't saying \"I can't stand those XXX\" without realizing that the person next her was in the XXX subculture.  \n\nSure, they can work it out.  But the advice to post an \"I'm sorry I hurt you' letter on his door then text him daily until he breaks down is just downright creepy advice.  It doesn't sound like he wants to work it out, and she should respect that.  She has tried calling and texting him already.  He hasn't responded.  To further escalate it is creepy.  \n\n Well, that's the thing... how do you *know* you've never said something this hurtful to another person?  Unfortunately, we can't ever know exactly how our words impact other people because we aren't them.  \n\nSomething that seems completely innocuous to you might be exceptionally hurtful to another person.

What the hell is wrong with you.  \nAnd calling someone the single-most hurtful thing you can (especially in an unrelated discussion), knowing fully the psychological traumas associated with it, that's also abuse. Plain and simple.  \nWhen someone abuses you, you don't stay and hope they will change. You leave and find someone who actually respects you. Nope, I'm not, so please DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.\n\nI was in an abusive marriage.  I LEFT.  You *don't know what other people went through*, so PLEASE don't assume.  OP is being emotionally abusive. You're saying that people \"are able to work through ... physical abuse\", and that the abuser and victim of abuse in this situation can \"surely work through\" this.  \nVerbal and emotional abuse are just as serious as getting hit. You're encouraging the abuser to try to continue a relationship with her victim, *even as he tries to leave*, and saying you don't think she need even seek professional help to fix herself. You're minimizing what she did, or you're complacent to the behavior.  \nI can't speak to the nature of your abuse, maybe he was an unabashed asshole, but I'm telling you now, and as clearly as I can: **Remorse is never a strong enough indicator that the abuse won't continue.** It means she's not a sociopath, but it by *no* means is grounds for staying with someone who deliberately and maliciously attacks someone with their biggest vulnerability, knowing the psychological trauma behind it. She picked the most painful and sensitive subject she could, and wielded it like a hammer with the specific intent of making herself feel good by causing him to feel terrible.  \nAnd you are encouraging her to pursue her victim, and that it's okay, because she feels guilty.  So, again, thanks for putting *your* words in *my* mouth.  NOT even remotely what I said or what I was saying.  EXACTLY what you said. I fucking QUOTED you. No, I haven't said anything this hurtful to anyone I love.  Ever.\n\nI also never slapped a baby, even once.  \n\nI also never drove drunk a single time.\n\nThere are lot of things in life that not everyone has done at least one time.

That is just shitty and horrible. You know that though. \n\n&gt; I feel so bad and I'm so scared that this will end our relationship.\n\nIt probably will. I have no idea how your boyfriend could ever forgive something like that. I wouldn't be able to; words leave scars. An ex called me frigid and a bad lay once - he couldn't figure out why I held it against him, when he told me he didn't mean it and only said it to hurt me. Well hey - words hurt. And people who say words that hurt, whether they mean them or are using them to hurt, are shitty people who need to learn how to not be shitty. \n\nThat is to say - look into counselling. You really really need to learn how to disagree and express anger without intentionally lashing out and hurting people.  &gt;he told me he didn't mean it and only said it to hurt me\n\nDid he think you were stupid, too? If he said it to hurt you, he meant it. Glad he's your ex.    Oh man :( \n\nIf it were me, I'd probably write a long apology letter and explain the situation because I can write things out better than I can speak them. Maybe send some flowers and say, 'You are more beautiful than these, I am sorry..I love you.' or something like that. I'm also cheesy, so there's that. \n\nI can understand where his hurt is coming from, so it is best to be patient with him. I know how heated arguments can get, I've said things I don't mean before.  As a person who isn't attractive... a comment like \"you're more beautiful than these flowers\" would make me feel a thousand times *worse*, and it would make your comment seem really fake.  You have to put yourself in the shoes of the person she hurt, here.  \n\nSending someone who is disfigured beautiful flowers with a message like that will almost *never* be received well.  It will serve to remind them that even flowers are more beautiful than they are.  I realize that's not your intention but again, shoes of the person who got hurt.   that's very true... when people compare my beauty to another's (or an objects, possibly worse?)... it always makes me a little sad. i'm fairly attractive but that doesn't mean i like to be compared to anyone or anything in this.  As a person who isn't attractive... a comment like \"you're more beautiful than these flowers\" would make me feel a thousand times *worse*, and it would make your comment seem really fake.  You have to put yourself in the shoes of the person she hurt, here.  \n\nSending someone who is disfigured beautiful flowers with a message like that will almost *never* be received well.  It will serve to remind them that even flowers are more beautiful than they are.  I realize that's not your intention but again, shoes of the person who got hurt.   I definitely see where you are coming from, but we tend to love the flaws in the people we love the most. She may surely believe he's the most beautiful man. \n\nBut she should definitely take your point into consideration when figuring out what to do, thanks for pointing that out. &gt; She may surely believe he's the most beautiful man.\n\nI think given her actions, she probably doesn't, so giving him a bouquet of flowers claiming that she thinks he's \"beautiful\" will come off as disingenuous, condescending, and clearly fake.  I definitely see where you are coming from, but we tend to love the flaws in the people we love the most. She may surely believe he's the most beautiful man. \n\nBut she should definitely take your point into consideration when figuring out what to do, thanks for pointing that out. I'm not saying she doesn't believe he's the most beautiful person on the planet.  That has *nothing* to do with how it feels to be the one who isn't attractive or is physically disfigured.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter what she actually feels or believes - what matters is that she vocalized something (in anger) that hits him where is the most vulnerable.   That's true. I hope I didn't come off as harsh or rude or anything - totally *not* my intention.  \n\nIt's just that being on this side of things isn't something a lot of people have to deal with, and even the best intentions can sometimes leave unattractive/disfigured people feeling shitty.  =)           You're not a horrible person. You've fucked up pretty badly but you know that.\n\nThere's nothing you can do here to make amends. Get in touch, tell him you're an idiot and that you're sorry. Then I'm afraid the ball is entirely in his court, it's up to him whether he forgives you or not. I have to admit, this sounds like a dealbreaker, so if he can bring himself to talk to you again, you need to be prepared for the fact that he's probably not going to have anything to say that you're going to like.\n\nI'm also one of those people capable of saying some awful shit in the heat of the moment. I've learned that I cannot trust myself when I'm angry. \n\nChalk this one down to experience. In future, if you're having a row with someone you love and it gets to the point where you are at risk of saying something venomous- make your excuses and get the fuck out of there. Cool off and come back to it with a clear head.\n\nYou're not a horrible person, you're just human. We all make mistakes. &gt; You're not a horrible person. \n\nCue the obligatory \"you're not a bad person\" in TwoX.  \n\nI'm sorry, but this is one of the most fucked up things you can do to a person short of physical harm.  It's not up to me to pass judgement on a whole life on the basis of one act. \n\nIt would be hypocritical of me to jump on the public flagellation bandwagon here, because as I've said, I too am capable of the most appallingly venomous comments when I'm angry. \n &gt; I too am capable of the most appallingly venomous comments when I'm angry.\n\nYou should probably not do that.

Doing a horrible thing does not make you a horrible person.  =/ How many horrible things does one have to do to become a \"horrible person\"?   &gt; You're not a horrible person. \n\nCue the obligatory \"you're not a bad person\" in TwoX.  \n\nI'm sorry, but this is one of the most fucked up things you can do to a person short of physical harm.   Holy shit, I think a lot of people are being *way* too harsh in this thread. (ie top comment) Has no one else said something mean in the heat of an argument and lived to regret it? \n\nIn my relationship with my SO, we've absolutely said really really mean things. You have to forgive each other (and also yourself ) and realize that people aren't perfect. Even people who love you more than anything else will sometimes be mean. \n\nSo what do you do now? Nothing, except contacting him (texts, emails, letters) to apologize again. If he is going to end a relationship with you based off one heated insult of \"ugly motherfucker\", that's his call and you can't change it unfortunately. \n\nHope it works out for you. \n yeah but  he was probably very insecure about his scars and feeling super unattractive and pulling a low blow like that to win an argument is tacky and just mean. i don't think she is horrible but i don't think the relationship is going to be what it was before. Its like telling your wife who is under chemo that she is ugly, ok maybe not like that but still it cuts deeper than telling your SO that you faked your orgasm last night or the lasagna was shit. \nI am not perfect and like everyone i have my insecurities but its to a level where i have body dysmorphic disorder and if my SO told me i was ugly i would feel sooooo freaking betrayed and hurt as fuck, man i hope that doesn't happen, lol.  &gt;i would feel sooooo freaking betrayed and hurt as fuck, man i hope that doesn't happen, lol.\n\nThat's the point. Realistically, your SO *is* going to let you down at one point or another- sometimes in a really hurtful way..... No shit he felt insecure about his scars and it was a mean comment. The point is, sometimes people go for low blows when they're really upset in an argument. And if you can't forgive someone for something they didn't mean, I dont think you're being realistic and are just setting yourself up for disappointment. \n\nIn my very humble opinion.           *(I want to be clear.. from the word go.. I'm not trying to make anyone feel guilty. I'm just trying to share my perspective on this, as a girl who has also had to deal with similar issues her whole life.)*\n\nI may not bear scars on my face (I have plenty on my body) but I have been called ugly.. and worse.. all my life. \n\nBeing called ugly is a horrific rejection. It demolishes your self-image, your self-esteem. You know.. you... you just *know* that to that person who threw that grenade of a word at you, you're a lump of flesh. You're not a person. You're not what's inside. \n\nAll you are is your scars. Your marks. Your ethnicity. Your eyes that don't sit right, aren't two lasers focused dead ahead, or are different shades, or are different colors.. Your nose that is kinked or isn't straight or is too wide. Your browbone that's too big or too bulged. Your forehead that's sloped or flat or bulbous. Your shoulders that are sloped. Your.. one of a million ways that you're Not Perfect, Not Ideal. \n\nYou're not the genius that can write novels with her eyes closed. You're not the storyteller that weaves perfect tales out of the aether. You're not an artist who can take a twig and papyrus and turn it into a work that lasts longer than empires. You're not a musician whose passion for the instrument is deeper than most people's love for their spouses. \n\nBut when you say that the person is ugly.. you damage them. The shrapnel.. it stings. It burns. It's laced with acid. Not many people can take that kind of assault. \n\nThose of us who were always \"ugly\".. we're weakened by it. Our lives are diminished by it. Overcoming that.. it's not easy. I still face that anxiety *every day* that someone will come up to me and throw that word in my face. There are nastier things people say about girls like me, true. But being called ugly.. that.. that really crushes me. \n\nThose that are later told that they're \"ugly\".. or worse, they think themselves \"ugly\".. they're turned from pillars of marble to piles of gelatin. He has internalized this, I fear. (I can't say.. my first name isn't Doctor, my last name isn't MD or PhD or anything like that.) \n\nForgive me for sounding preachy.. I don't want to. I didn't want to rant.. but I don't know how else to express this but to try to give perspective from someone else who has been in a similar situation.  But you knew that this was a Big Deal for the guy. Yes, you were angry.. but even in anger, there are lines one should know not to cross. You did. He looked at you with a betrayed look.. because his trust.. was.. lost. C'est tout. \n\nYou can't take back what you said any more than you can unscramble an egg.. or, well, unlob a grenade. It's *done*. It's something to add to the long list of things you regret, the list every living person has. (Not trying to guilt you on that.. Please don't read that last line as such, because I know that you're feeling genuinely guilty about this.) \n\nYou can try to reach out to the guy. But it's up to him. He can choose to forgive or not. But he can't forget this.  I'm ugly too, but I think that being disfigured is one order of magnitude above regular \"ugliness\".  If the OP's boyfriend has facial scarring, he has to deal with all sorts of nastiness every time he goes out in public that the merely ugly do not deal with.  I don't have to deal with small children pointing and asking \"Mommy, what happened to this person?\"  I don't have to see the look of disgust/pity on the face of everyone I interact with in the course of a day, from the cashier at the grocery store to the stranger on the sidewalk.  I don't have to deal with people staring at me.  \n\nBut that said, the home - and a loving relationship - should be one's refuge from the wounds inflicted by an often cruel and uncaring world.  The home should be one place where you feel safe and loved.  The home should be the place where you are accepted as you are - ugliness and all.  This goes for the disfigured as well as for the merely ugly.\n\nI'm ugly, but my girlfriend always tells me I am beautiful.  And I love her for it.  I really don't understand why people have been so aggressive towards that OP.  Is it because her boyfriend was a vet?  I don't know.  It's still a normal relationship with two people who were arguing, where one person said something in the heat of the moment that would, contextually, hurt the other a great deal.  \n\nOP, you sound like you're experiencing a shit tonne of guilt, which is to be expected.  You obviously didn't mean what you said, but you were angry and maybe you wanted to hurt him at the time, so you said it.  I agree with a few posts here who've said write down your feelings and send them to him.  Be kind and understanding.  Explain why you think you might have said what you said (anger, needing to hurt him), and stress that you really don't feel that he is ugly at all.  Why would you have been with him all this time if you didn't fancy him?  Also make sure you acknowledge how hard this must be for him, and try not a derail things with talking about yourself too much.  He might not forgive you, but I think you can get past this.   &gt; I've pretty much just been sitting at home crying and feeling like the most horrible person who ever lived.\n\nYeah imagine how he feels.  The fact that you seem to be more concerned about that you feel bad rather than the damage you may have done to him is a huge concern.  The one person who he though could look past his greatest fear doesn't and will now use it against him to hurt him.  You attached him in the way that you knew would hurt him the most and you seem to have gotten what you wanted.  Thats the thing about the childish need to hurt someone you can never take it back, you can only hope they forgive you and are able to move on. \"The fact that you seem to be more concerned about that you feel bad rather than the damage you may have done to him is a huge concern.\"\n\nWTF?!  How exactly is OP showing that she's more concerned about feeling bad than she is about her SO?  Did you even *read* what she posted?  \n\nShe's here because she feels like shit and *she wants to fix what she fucked up*.  How does that NOT show that her focus is on righting a wrong?        ",

It makes zero sense. Exactly my thought, I wonder where all the leftover men are?\n There's a term called \"bare branches\" for men who aren't married and therefore don't have kids / the ability to leave a patriarchal legacy.  Exactly my thought, I wonder where all the leftover men are?\n They exist, but they are not labelled as such. They're simply \"men who *decided* not to get married for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nEdit: wrong apparently, they are called \"leftovers\" as well.  What??? There was a post (linking to an article in the Atlantic) in 2XC literally a week ago about leftover men! [Found it](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/chinas-new-bachelor-class/273040/). You are right, they are called leftovers as well. Having now read both articles, I've come to the conclusion that it isn't necessarily there is no single phenomenon causing \"leftovers\" of either sex. As seen with the western countries, modernization comes hand in hand with a later marrying age: people want to further their careers and explore their opportunities before settling down with someone. The real problem here seems to be the older generation who have not quite adapted to the **rapid** economic growth of China, and thus they come up with the label of \"leftovers\". They can say, and rightfully so, \"When I was your age, I was married with a 2nd child on the way!\" In the BBC article, it states that the average age for marriage was 20 in the 50s, 25 in the 80s, and 27 now. And it makes some sense. Given that marriage age and economic growth are correlated, the faster a country grows, the faster the marriage age will be delayed. \n\nSo in my opinion, neither gender really should be considered a \"leftover\" in the traditional sense; that is, something that is in surplus and is undesirable. Simply put, the times are changing. It would be better if everyone just adopted the view of the woman at the end of the BBC article; \"Elissa says she'd love to meet the right man, but it will happen when it happens.\"  What???

But girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult,\" reads an excerpt from an article titled, Leftover Women Do Not Deserve Our Sympathy, posted on the website of the All-China Federation of Women in March 2011.\n&gt;\n&gt;It continues: \"These girls hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is, they don't realise that as women age, they are worth less and less. So by the time they get their MA or PhD, they are already old - like yellowed pearls.\"\n\ngood god. how degrading. Seriously. It's all a bunch of archaic bullshit anyway. The idea that a woman who's 27 is \"too old to marry\" comes from a time when families needed to have 4 to 6 kids. \n\nIn pure biology, yeah, if you wait till you're 35 to marry and reproduce, you're probably not going to realistically have a half dozen kids. But so what? That standard came from a time when infant and childhood mortality was ridiculously high. Each couple needed to have 4 to 6 kids just to keep the population level. \n\nNow? Not so much. Hell, this is China, home of the freaking one child policy! I don't see how you can possibly have a one child policy and somehow think 27 is too old to marry. It's ridiculous.

As a woman who got her bachelors late(r) than most people, and is now trying to find a way into grad school and is turning 29 in 2 days... this stings. Like, a lot. \nAlso, it's just ignorant and narrow-minded. These women are educated and hard working individuals living their lives the way they want to live them! They are not trying to impress anyone just so they can marry well. They are supporting themselves and living what they find to be fulfilling lives and that is NOBODY'S business but their own.

If you choose to spend your best reproductive years in school, it's a natural side effect that time takes its toll. \n\n\"Like yellowed pearls\" is quite unnecessary though, what the hell? I just don't see why we need to reproduce at all. Because it's what's expected of us? Because as women we have an obligation to become wives and mothers? Pssssh. The world is over-populated enough, especially in China! Why do they care so much about other people's life choices? It's not uncommon for governments to try and spur people into settling down and having families. They're the ones who pay most of the tax's. They also want smart women to breed so they have more smart people, it kinda makes sense.\n\n Yea, but smart people exist in all levels of society, educated or not. The same goes for idiots.

Well, in a way it's true, because older women will have a tougher time reproducing.  And in general, women would take money over looks in their partner, while men would take looks over money in theirs, so you can see how that ends up.\n\nAnother thing is, a lot of these successful career women want to marry someone who makes as much or more than they do, also someone who owns his own apartment, so you can see how it narrows their dating prospects.

Her sister refused to let her be godmother to her children because she's not a \"responsible enough\" (married) person. UGH!\n\nThe kicker? She's twenty five!

Yah I would say the difference is that that attitude is the norm in China.

Having a daughter is a status symbol, but only if she marries. It brings down the family's social standing when she waits. It's... Very, very old fashioned, but still very much the norm in China.

As opposed to being labeled a leftover women by society in other countries. \n\nI'm 37 and single and financially independent in the US.  About 5 years ago I noticed that people stopped asking me about my personal life. I think they just kind of figured it was too late for me so they didn't even bother to concern-troll anymore. \n\nI'm fine with it except for the social isolation. I think people are afraid it's catching.   Aren't a ton of middle class Chinese women bailing to the U.S. and other Western countries because of this? From the immigrants I've met, they tend to say the people who can leave China will leave, male or female. However, the country is so poor, most people can't afford to do so (people in China live off an average $2/day). I hope China turns itself around at some point and starts caring more about their citizens. This really isn't the way a country that wants to be a superpower should be acting. Women being treated horribly is just one of their many human rights issues.  The problems that these so-called \"leftover women\" face in China are unfortunately real. Traditionally, women in China are expected to marry upwards (or at least, to a social equal), so these women, who bust their asses in their \"prime\" to get to the top suddenly find that their marriage pool suddenly shrunk. I'd understand too, if I were a successful woman making millions of yuan, I wouldn't want to marry a low-life with no career prospects either. Women in China are usually expected to have children (including myself, as a Chinese-Canadian), and encouraged to have children before they turn thirty, out of fear of declining fertility.\n\nBut at the same time, Chinese men are usually expected to marry younger women, and those who are successful have a huge pool of young, pretty women who would love to be trophy wives or even mistresses. A lot of Chinese men I know seem to prefer women who are not as advanced career-wise as they are. \n\nI think China needs to first of all, re-think the urgency of having kids and the role of women as baby-factories, which is difficult to do, as it is a basic tenet of Confucian culture, and do something about the rampant social inequality and cutthroat competition in Chinese society, so that people can actually be evaluated as unique people in and or themselves, as opposed to a disposable social unit wherein they're considered useless simply because they didn't fulfil their social duties.\n\n/rant Why is someone a low-life for not earning a lot of money?  Is a man supporting his wife somehow more acceptable than a wife supporting her husband? Or are women who don't earn a lot low-lives too?\n\nEdit: I get that you might be talking about another type of person, like someone with no goals who doesn't want to contribute financially to a relationship, but everyone who doesn't make a lot of money shouldn't be lumped in with a negative group. &gt;I wouldn't want to marry a low-life with no career prospects\n\nShe didn't call them low-lifes for not making a lot of money. She called them so for not have any career prospects. I'm not sure I'd call someone a low-life for that, but huge difference between having no career prospects and simply \"not earning a lot of money\" The problems that these so-called \"leftover women\" face in China are unfortunately real.

Women in China are usually expected to have children (including myself, as a Chinese-Canadian), and encouraged to have children before they turn thirty, out of fear of declining fertility.\n\nBut at the same time, Chinese men are usually expected to marry younger women, and those who are successful have a huge pool of young, pretty women who would love to be trophy wives or even mistresses. A lot of Chinese men I know seem to prefer women who are not as advanced career-wise as they are. \n\nI think China needs to first of all, re-think the urgency of having kids and the role of women as baby-factories, which is difficult to do, as it is a basic tenet of Confucian culture, and do something about the rampant social inequality and cutthroat competition in Chinese society, so that people can actually be evaluated as unique people in and or themselves, as opposed to a disposable social unit wherein they're considered useless simply because they didn't fulfil their social duties.\n\n/rant   My god, fuck that shit. I'm 28, single and obviously unmarried. It's hard enough as it is, without jerktwats chiming in with retard propaganda. \n\nBeing from post-communism country, i feel the immense pressure due to traditional, male-oriented heritage where woman is indeed seen as a weaker, less valuable servant of man and family. Men are mostly meek and /or violent, stuckups who naturally stay with their parents well into their 30s and 40s have no clue how to cook or clean up after themselves YET wont settle for anything short of runway model that cooks, cleans and brings money to the table.\n\nFuck that shit, I say, yet again.  I'm happy that you're so independent, but \n\n&gt; Men are mostly meek and /or violent, stuckups who naturally stay with their parents well into their 30s and 40s have no clue how to cook or clean up after themselves\n\nFuck you for generalizing.

Men who refuse to grow up, led by mental models of grandeur, men playing endless simulation with real consequences. Yet, those are the same men creating a reality where 27 year old woman is second-hand goods, of reduced value, men who pray on women, gays, black, anything and everything that is not blending with the environment.

    "snippet" : "I've never posted anything here before- this is obv. a throwaway account. I guess I’m just wondering if therapy actually works for people, or if it will work for me. Or if I just need better friends to actually listen.\n\nDoes anyone here- cry? Every day, every other day. I do it a lot. I’ve gotten better at it during the years, enough that I can cry in class and the person next to me doesn’t even notice. Same on the train during my commute. Well I’m kind of sick of it to be honest. I’m sick of being in class, doing work, and then all it takes is some stupid little thought or insecurity to come waltzing into my head and I’ll start tearing up and just lose concentration in class.\n\nI guess that might be the first problem. Thoughts. I’m a constant daydreamer, I can’t help it. I can zone out for a good amount of time, and just warp myself up in my own world. There I’m beautiful, and have friends, and people actually want to talk to me and actually be my friend and my boyfriend has eyes for me alone, and my roomates actually wanted me to move in to be their friend and not just another person to pay the bills. Dammit I’m tearing up again, and this time in the library. Stupid little immature thoughts that just get to me. I moved halfway across the nation for university, trying to escape all my problems and insecurities in my home state. Freshman year I was single and made so many new friends. Sophmore year it seems my insecurities finally caught up to me again.\n\nThis always happens when I get a boyfriend, I’ve never really known what it’s like to be single except for a couple months. Someone always claims me, and the thought seems nice because it makes me feel like I’m welI enough of a person that someone notices me and wants to be my friend and wants to love me. I love being in relationship, but they bring out all the sadness in me because of my low self-esteem. I just want to make someone happy and be perfect and in return have them just love me and be there for me. Crap. Crap. Crap. \n\nI love to daydream, it gets me happy and gives me a burst of energy (kind makes me pace a lot too... made for an awkward enough adolescence when you’re accidently blurting out dialogue from  a daydream or smiling at nothing). But it’s also a little annoying to others, like every now and then someone asking me a question or my boyfriend telling me a story. I’ve gotten good at remembering the last couple sentences and going from there- the only one that notices that is my boyfriend and it annoys him. I just get so preoccupied in my own thoughts, it will make a task like just DOING stuff take longer. “Hey can you get water from the kitchen?” I go to the kitchen…well wander to there… and then get there stand there for a bit and return empty handed (obv. doesn’t happen ALL the time, but enough that it’s a ‘thing’). My boyfriend thinks it’s a cute quirk of mine. It makes me feel stupid and useless.\n\nWhat he doesn’t think is cute is my crying over nothing. He claims he’s been depressed though, and that is encouraging to me but I feel like we my still be on different pages. I mean, no two depressed people are the same and deal with the same issues….right? He used to think it was kind of cute, again, that I was so sensitive. It always starts that way… I cry a little at first, they give me comfort and hugs and love. But it just doesn’t go away, and then instead of being understanding it’s defensive and anger towards my crying. “you’re embarrassing me, people are going to think I’m a woman abuser or something!” “Is this your way of punishing me?” And what do I do? Cry. Cry as I watch my emotions ruin everything.\n\nI can be happy too though. Sometimes I can be confident, and even somewhat witty and feel smart. I feel like I get a little annoying when I’m happy and even a bit too spontaneous. \n\nI don’t know what to write anymore. Writing this felt nice, but I doubt it will actually fix anything. \n  You really should see a therapist, or even a psychiatrist so that you could possibly get prescribed an antidepressant. You can start by reaching out to your college's counseling center, which would have plenty of resources for your process of seeking help.\n\nA lot of people are put off by the thought of therapists and antidepressants, but it could make a HUGE difference in your quality of life if this is being caused by a chemical imbalance. \n\nCrying is normal. Crying at little things once in a while is normal. Crying all the time is not normal, and you seem to recognize that. This sounds like depression. Daydreaming is also very common, but you might want to consider ADHD could have a role to play in your inability to focus on reality. At times you are happy, maybe too happy. Be ready to hear the possibility of being bipolar, which has a strong stigma surrounding it, but it is a very manageable disorder. Now, I am NOT a psychiatrist but I have a lot of experience with mental disorders. I am not qualified to dispense any diagnoses, especially over the internet based on a few paragraphs. I am really just trying to give you my opinion on what might be causing some of your problems and what psychiatrists might see from a description similar to this.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds as if he could potentially be a very supportive partner if you decide to seek help, which I highly recommend. It is hard to continue being with someone who won't help themselves. You need to help yourself by seeking help. You sound like an extremely bright and capable woman. Seek help. This post is a great first step in recognizing that there are things you can do to change what is wrong in your life.\n\nFinally, as for whether therapy actually helps, I've seen a few therapists in my time and my biggest advice is don't settle for a therapist who you are not comfortable with. Therapists need to be a good fit for you in order to help. Once I learned that, I made a lot of progress with a therapist that fit me.\n\nI wish you the best of luck dear!

I've had depression before and YES, going and talking to a therapist helped me a lot. I don't believe I'll ever be over it completely 100% and I still randomly cry at times (even when it seems at times that I've got nothing to cry about), but I do definitely feel a lot better now.\n\nYou sound like you have some self-esteem issues and may indeed be depressed (I'm no doctor so I can't say for absolute certainty). We all feel doubtful of ourselves at times and if you didn't doubt yourself, you wouldn't be human. Relationships can often bring out of insecurities as well and you'd be hard-pressed to find a person who didn't experience the same self-doubt issues you described while you are in one.\n\nJust remember, none of your feelings are worthless and they all mean something. Just be honest with your boyfriend about what you're feeling, he's not a psychic...a good therapist can help you become more in touch with your self-doubt issues and depression.

I secretly cry all the time. It's--well. I do have lots of reasons, but sometimes I just cry. A lot. I'm overly emotional, it happens. Usually it's cathartic, but I recently went through a period of daily sobbing and it just seemed to fuel more crying, if anything.   \n\nI felt completely drained and significantly better after my last big cry, though, which is genuinely helpful. I don't know what to say. Life is difficult. I don't really talk about this with many people; it's just my burden to bear.   \n\n\"Laugh when you can, cry when you must,\" have always been the words I've lived by. I'm sorry things have been difficult for you. I can relate very much to the dreaminess and emotionality you describe, and while everyone has their own path and you should do what works for you personally, I've found little of value in therapy and psychiatry and much to value in daydreams and sincere bursts of emotion. It's a harder path, I think, to see tears and spaciness as virtues, but it's what's helped me live my life. Hopefully you'll find something that works for you.  That definitely sounds like depression.\n\nThat also sounds exactly like what I was going through at one point.\n\nI still daydream pretty much all the time, and up until recently I was in constant relationships for more than two years.\n\nTo be honest, try *not* being in a relationship. It doesn't have to be right now, I see that you're currently in one, but trust me. You'll start to realize the benefits of loving yourself and you will start to realize that a relationship is only good if you're both caring for each other and needing each other equally. I'm not goig to lie I feel a lot more confident and happy when I'm alone, thing is t always generates some sort of attention (girl having coffee and listening to music alone attracts more vultures than I thought) and gah in suh a sucker for a guy with charm and I just fall for it and get sexual and stuff.   If you can't get to counseling and feel hopeless still, try [this website](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) out.  It's a little cheesy, but it's basically cognitive behavioral therapy for free, at your own leisure.  It will help you sort out those warped thoughts of yours.  &lt;3  \n\nI think you're normal, just going through depression, and dealing with the young people blues.  I had it for years til recently, somehow at 28 I've come out of it.  All my friends dealt with it in some shade.  Being young is hard.  I'm not trying to sound patronizing... I genuinely wouldn't trade the wisdom, experience, and security that comes with time and age for any of the stuff I felt in my early 20s and late teens.  There's so much pressure on you and all these expectations out of life that have been building up through your teens that might not match reality.  There's your first big relationships, first big jobs, moving away from home, watching all your friends find new friends and fall out of touch... there's so much going on at that stage of life.

My roommate in college was taking some for awhile (I forget which brand) that seriously had a side effect of \"uncontrollable crying.\" She had to switch birth control because of it.\n\nIt sounds like you need something that would give you another outlet for emotions and a confidence boost, maybe you could take up a sport through your college, like kickboxing or judo or something similar.
