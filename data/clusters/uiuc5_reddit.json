[The Pickus Company](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/other/2005-06-29/city-council-picks-burnham-developer-study-session.html), who were the developers behind Burnham 310, considered trying to get a Whole Foods, Wild Oats, or Trader Joe's way back in 2005. From [an article](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/features/its-your-business/2012-09-16/its-your-business-craft-brewery-mahomet.html) in the News Gazette earlier this year: \n\n&gt; Alison Mochizuki, director of public relations for Trader Joe's, said Thursday that Champaign-Urbana is not included in the company's plan for new stores in 2013 and 2014 \"at this time.\"\n\nAlso, Trader Joe's stores tend to open in metropolitan areas with a dense population and high income and education levels, which is not exactly the case for CU.   I've petitioned too and wrote them directly.  They kindly replied they would look into it but most likely thought that our community wasn't the right fit.  This was back in 2010.

I've petitioned too and wrote them directly.  They kindly replied they would look into it but most likely thought that our community wasn't the right fit.  This was back in 2010.  Wouldn't a Trader Joe's in C-U pretty much put Common Ground Food Co-op out of business? It'd probably put Strawberry Fields out of business; Common Ground seems to have a much more loyal following.  I was told in a BADM class that the CU area does not fit the Trader Joe's market positioning strategy; their finance people and the other bigwigs who open new stores require strict criteria for choosing their locations.  One of these criteria, if I remember correctly, are the number of college-educated households bringing in six figures annually, and apparently the number isn't high enough for them to move on it. \n\nTL:DR They don't see enough money in C-U to invest in a location here  ",

Courier Cafe (ive had a good time there, but service can be sketch at times)\n\nSights? Champaign Art Theatre : 35mm Film Theatre its a cool experience.\n\nSports? All the main sports things are down near FAR/PAR, im a huge tennis fan so Atkins tennis center is great for playing tennis with super nice courts\n\nDepends what you're looking for, but I really enjoy the variety of downtown champaign, the restaurants and cafes. The rest of campus gets redundant after 4 years (but thats to be expected)\n\nFeel free to ask more questions. Thanks, I am going to visit downtown Champaign and i am also a tennis fan, so i'll make sure to check out the tennis center The real thing I love about U of I is that even though its a public school it has a great program. You meet a very diverse group of people if you put in the effort (lest you fall into a clique) \n\nQuad day is always insanely fun. There is a club for anything. \n\nIt really depends what you want to Major in, if its financially worth it (im out of state and I do Civil Engineering, we are #1 for undergrad and grad.)\n I am from Illinois and doing Chem/Pre-Med so i hope its gonna be worth it. Well I know Chemistry is somewhat well known here? And Pre-Med it doesn't matter too much where you go, its more so Med School itself as many of my friends have said. That being said, I'm sure the program is fine here considering my roomies parents both graduated from here and are well paid Doctors.\n\nInstate = cheap. Lucky you! Unfortunately in state here is still expensive :( womp. Just not as expensive as out of state! 40,000$ out of state.. with out them scholarships.. I would cry you a river. Sorry! All I meant is that compared to other state's in school tuition, it's pretty expensive. For example, Indiana University in-state is like $14k. Illinois is $28k.  I am from Illinois and doing Chem/Pre-Med so i hope its gonna be worth it. I am from Illinois and doing Chem/Pre-Med so i hope its gonna be worth it.

The exams aren't really what people are interested in these days. A high score on the exams really isn't that difficult to acquire if you've been attending the lecture and do the proper work.

I see them working very hard (at least the graduate students), so I wonder why they would need to cheat. That is my observation for undergrads only. I don't personally know any grad students that cheat, nor have I heard of anyone in my department blatantly cheating.  This is really interesting. I had a friend in MSE 401 last semester who observed that during an in-class quiz, one international student, wearing a white hoodie, asked to go to the bathroom, and another international student, this one wearing a purple hoodie, came back.\nWhat saddened me most about this was that it was unclear whether anything was done about this at all- I imagine it would have been pretty easy to prove that there was something academically dishonest going on. Your friend should have said something after class. Professor Dillon would have at least started watching that student more closely.  Remember kids, crime pays.  Anyone have a screenshot of the message that was posted? It has now disappeared. Word must have spread fast and reached the original poster. \n\nI'm also curious, is this kind of behavior accepted in Chinese culture - the end being more important than the means? If hypothetically I wanted to hire someone to take my exams, I would be too embarrassed to post it on a public message board, I would do it more discreetly to maintain some semblance of dignity/respectability. There must be many Chinese people on /r/uiuc - please clarify this for the rest of us. Do the others who read those boards simply accept it as normal and look the other way and leave these posts unreported? Even OP calls themself \"wasnotmybusiness\".

I'm going to overly generalize this but I feel like it's applicable to international students from all countries, not just China.\n\nMany come from VERY wealthy families. This should be pretty obvious as out of state tuition is already insanely high. I know a lot of people with wealthy backgrounds who fuck around 24/7.\n\nThe other percentage of international students came here with a lot of  hard work. Often times their families have spent all their savings in order to provide their children with a good education in the States.\n\nNo, it is definitely not accepted as a part of the culture.

From what I've seen they have a very different cultural understanding of what constitutes cheating.

A large group of them also got caught buying past exams (which weren't supposed to be available) and when the professor found out they complained because they bought them fair and square. The entire exam results were thrown out.\n\nThings like this seemed much more common with the Chinese students than the other international groups. It's not that they want to be lazy --its the opposite.

Just bring your I-card, resumes, and preferably a printed name tag from DCL so you don't have to wait in the line for those. \n\nAlso suit up. Do one really have to suit up? Yeah it's the dress code - it's like a uniform, *everyone* sticks to it, even women. You'd feel very out of place if you didn't suit up. If you're not looking for a job/internship and are simply there to collect freebies I guess you can go in jeans - not sure if anyone checks you are dressed properly before they let you enter. I was planning to go in with a nice dress shirt, dress pant and dress shoe. No suit. I think it's professional enough? I did something like that last time and carried a plastic folder instead of a leather portfolio and I did feel quite out of place - and that was in September when it was too hot for a suit. I don't know whether employers will discriminate but you might yourself feel less confident if you are underdressed. You could just look around the first day and decide how you feel about it. Maybe a sports coat would do if you don't have a suit (not sure though - maybe others here know this stuff better).

    "snippet" : "A few representatives spoke in my ECE 110 class and had us fill out a card. Heard back from the guys for a meeting. Gut feeling said it was was a scam.  I did this a couple summers ago. Not really a scam, but its super shady. You'll go through some basic training for painting, but most of it focuses on business. You will make your own painting business, market it, hire for it, book painting jobs, and manage the work sites. The whole program is kind of a crap shoot. If you're lucky you'll have a lot of help for the summer and spring and hire some good workers, paint 10-15 houses, and pocket around $10,000 during the summer. If you're unlucky, you'll be left to fend for yourself, and have very little to show for it, and end up either making $2,000 or just breaking even. Either way, it all boils down to how much you time you put in to it. It can be around 20-30hrs/week during the semester and the 50+hrs/week during the summer on the high end, or you could put in the minimum and have a shitty time. All in all, I don't regret doing it, but I wouldn't do it again if I got the chance. If my lackluster response doesn't give you enough info., feel free to ask me more.

One of my friends did this a couple summers ago and hired all of his friends to work for him. I think he ended up making around 10,000 but lost most of his friends because he was paying them less than minimum wage. He would block off a wall and say this wall should take 4 hours and it would take 8 because most of the houses were in shitty condition and prepping took a long time. So we would get paid 8.25 X 4 hours for 8 hours of manual labor.\n\nAlso college works takes like 30% and i think the district manager takes 10-15% you also pay for equipment and supplies so if you really wanted to do this do it yourself and you could make a hell of a lot more.

Anyone with a lot of friends would be able to do the same thing. Whether they were in a fraternity or not. I know but that's not really the point.  Why? Any social person could do the same thing. Anyone in say the rock climbing club could easily get all their rock climbing friends to vote for them. Do you really expect antisocial people to do as well in elections as social people? Politics shouldn't be dependent on who you know. It can be dependent on popularity, but only if that popularity is drawn from support for your political ideals. I doubt people who know a candidate for their rockclimbing skills would be informed of their politics.  Well then leave frat's out of it because it's a political problem bro.\n Sorry I didn't mean it to come off as such.

How is banning smoking expensive? A) Enforcing the ban costs money (staff, processing)\n\nB) Setting up places to sequester the smokers (smoking huts, designated areas, etc)\n\nDo you have an idea of how much just those goddamn metal signs cost? It's ridiculous and most of of all DOES NOT MAKE THIS CAMPUS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE CASH-COW THAT IS INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS Two points:\n\n1) ISS did not sponsor or support the smoking ban. Regardless of what University officials may have said, the ban was conceived and promoted by the former Student Trustee - an elected official beyond the control of the ISS.\n\nI for one hate smoking, but a total ban on a campus this size is ill-advised and a clear violation of personal freedom.\n\n2) As a member of the Academic (faculty-student) Senate's committee on University Student Life, I don't remember smoking shelters or designated areas coming up in discussion. I wouldn't expect to see any. 1) The resources of the campus police or whoever would be enforcing this waste of time are not infinite, and either the university must spend more to add officers to not cut on policing elsewhere or they will be tied up doing garbage like citing people for smoking instead of driving around giving jaywalking tickets like we need them to (sarcasm on that last bit...) And yes, the funds for this sort of thing won't come from the ISS but they have to come from somewhere and I sure as shootin' know UIUC is not running a massive surplus.\n\n2) The shelters and such had been discussed by various people involved with the ban in the past, didn't realize there wasn't an a policy of \"hit the bricks, asshole\" instead of one of accomodation. Actually, it looks like they are going for more of a 'hit the bricks, asshole' approach.\n\nhttp://www.campusrec.illinois.edu/Smoke-Free/faq.html\n\n&gt;Question: Will there be designated smoking areas on campus?\n&gt;\nNo. Smoking will be prohibited on all campus grounds. There are two reasons for this:\n&gt;\nEstablishing designated smoking areas undermines the new policy. The purpose of the policy is to create a health-supporting community for everyone, tobacco-users and non-users alike. Creating smoking areas does not contribute to that purpose.\n&gt;\nSmoking zones and perimeter policies have not been found to be effective or enforceable, and smoking shelters are expensive to construct and maintain. Campuses with full smoke-free policies have reported fewer problems with compliance than policies that include smoking areas.  But guys, if we don't fund the Student Senate, then how else will they be able to pay for [more than $9,000 in self-advertisement?](http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/article_8b09184a-47e2-11e2-af22-001a4bcf6878.html)\n\nSeriously, I hate our student government for shit like this.  If other RSOs need to raise their own money if they want more than basic funding, why does the student government deserve special treatment? I can literally think of dozens of better ways to spend that money on campus.  Why give it to a bunch of entitled, self-involved clowns?\n\n1) Repaint the bike lanes on campus\n2) Improve CITES infrastructure/staff\n3) Build/improve bus shelters on some of the more common stops on campus\n4) Fix some of the aging AV systems in the classrooms on campus\n5) Better quality toilet paper for the restrooms on campus\n6) Improve the desks/chairs in some of the older classrooms\n7) Investigate safer ways to route street traffic through/around campus\n8) A student sponsored scholarship for underprivileged or underrepresented students\n9) An annual campus wide reward to recognize outstanding instructors\n10) Improve the security systems on the dormitories\n11) Pay for campus police to do extra patrols of some of the more dangerous areas on campus\n12) Replace/repair some of the damaged equipment in the ARC\n\nAnd those are just off the top of my head. To address your concerns:\n\n1. I've been told that Urbana and Champaign actually own these. Although that never made much sense to me, you'd get more traction calling your City Councilperson.\n2. Does anything in particular bother you about CITES?\n3. Again, I'm not sure if the shelters belong to the University or MTD. I'll look into it. Any stops in particular you'd like to see? (I spend most of my time north of Green, so I'm not ideally placed to know about the southern bus routes.)\n4. ISS once tried to have a ceiling projector installed in a room at the Union. The University wanted $15,000 just to install the mounting bracket and power outlet. That should give some perspective on how much an AV system costs.\n5. God yes, though I would wager the budget for toilet paper is more than any twenty students pay in tuition.\n6. Last I heard, the state of Illinois owes the University tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars for maintenance and renovation projects. Combine that with a multi-year planning, purchasing, and evaluation process, and renovating one classroom or lab can take the better part of a decade and $100,000. The Academic (faculty-student) Senate has started a lobbying effort with the state legislature to fix some of these issues, but it's going to be an uphill battle.\n7. There are Campus Committees dedicated to this kind of thing, but they often lack students willing offer input. [Apply here](http://www.iss.illinois.edu/ccapplication.aspx).\n8. Agreed.\n9. University administrators giving large cash gifts to faculty? That sounds like a recipe for corruption to me, but I'm a bit of a cynic. The ISS [gives out \"Teaching Excellence Awards\" annually](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/16wadn/seeking_nominations_for_teaching_excellence_awards/) by the way, based on student nominations.\n10. As a graduate student, I'm not familiar with security at the student dorms. Anything particularly concerning there?\n11. I agree that we need to up police presence on campus at night. I did my undergraduate at Virginia Tech, and the campus police there were far more active at night than here.\n12. Campus Rec receives a very generous budget from the University and student fees. If something is broken and not fixed quickly, it's most likely not been reported up to the people in charge. I can get you the contact info if you have specifics.\n\nAnything else? That was super interesting and informative, and I can tell you put a lot of thought and effort into it.  Thank you!  If I could transfer my karma down here to get more attention to your post, I would do it.  People should definitely read it.  I'm not going to do a point by point response to distract from it (but I do want to discuss all of this more!)\n\nThe reason for my list was more to make the point that an increase in tuition should go toward improving the life of students on campus, and that I could easily think of some of those ways off the top of my head.  Maybe they're not all practical, but there's obviously a lot we could do.  I don't really see student government taking the lead on these kinds of issues.

Keep in mind that number is for... you know... *actual businesses*. Unless they're swimming in printer ink, I refuse to believe that they can run through that much money.\n\nI hope that their actual *spending* was nowhere near the amount that they *budgeted*. The average business doesn't have to print out **54 copies of everything**.\n\nBecause each senator has to receive the agenda, minutes, and pieces of proposed legislation in print at the meetings, the ISS goes through a mountain of paper and ink - even printing two pages per side and double-sided. (It has been suggested that this be done digitally only, but that would unfairly exclude student senators unable to afford electronics.) Then you start piling on staples, binders (for storing all those documents until the session ends), pens, printer repair/replacement costs...\n\nI don't think the amount spent comes near the budgeted amount in the end, but that budget reflects a sort of worst case scenario. (That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Why not just hold your meetings in a lecture hall with powerpoint capability?   \nCouple that with reminding senators that there are plenty of tech labs on campus, you'd save a significant amount of money on supplies regardless of what it actually is.

(That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Honestly, many students (if not most) have either a laptop or smartphone, or something to read digital documents off of. And if they don't they can print out a copy before the meeting.   I wish that most of the students who would be voting on this could see the discussion going on here. I feel like a big problem in this referendum wll be all the students who don't know anything about the issue (myself included) who read the question and say \"meh, 2 dollars, no big deal, and anyway it boosts student power\" and don't know exactly what the ISS does. To this date I still don't know what the ISS does, all I've seen are ads from them. Frankly I think my residence hall's executive board puts on better events than they do, and their funding comes from the University Housing payments so they're not about to charge students just to entertain them. When is voting going on?\nI did not hear about this until I saw this thread and I can't find information about this online.    I am a prior Student Senator. I think that the separate fee is not a good pursuit of the Student Senate's time and energy. The Student Senate had significant independence some time ago (pre-2008 IIRC) and it resulted in some heavy corruption, but also a huge restructuring by the Senate in self-policing and oversight. While I was there, we had great Treasurers that ensured everything was financially accounted for, and frequently wound up . That said, the Student Senate can often get a little bit pushed around by the University administration to toe the line on some issues, so I can understand their desire to obtain financial independence from what the administration deigns to provide.\n\nSecond, people have asked what Student Senate even does. Are there a lot of fratstars in the Senate? Sure. It's a power position, it's bound to attract those kinds of people. However, we do a variety of things for the student body:\n\n-Lobbying Springfield on behalf of the student body and University (this is probably where most of the phone bill cost comes from). We also host the cost of bus transportation for the student body to assist on Illinois Day with lobbying.\n\n-Educating students about their rights regarding interactions with police. Given the degree of intoxication that goes on, we do this several times a year to try and provide some legal knowledge to the student body.\n\n-Hosting the Student Trustee debate (arguably the most important position in the student body)\n\n-Determining better use of traffic systems (I saw this point come up further down the page). There are committees that actually manage this. I was on one myself.\n\n-Serving as the sounding board of the student body. You get a diverse array of opinions in 40,000 students, and while individual groups can push for action on an issue, we serve as a way to pare down all those different opinions into one that is easily digestible by the administration. Dear God, you should have seen the debates that occurred about the administration's actions taken during the Next Dance.\n\n-Finally, I won't mince words. We also serve as an extra funding board for student issues. This can range from assisting Habitat for Humanity, multicultural social events, graduate student town halls, or environmental action nights. $9,000 on just advertising is a lot to drop and plain ridiculous. That would eliminate numerous valuable events that could have been held, and Activity Day is actually a better return on our investment ($12 registration fee for a table netting hundreds of interested students).\n\n**Source:** I am a former Student Senator, 2009-2010, and literally drafted by my classmates (I didn't choose to run until they put me on the ballot and voted me in based on my advocacy work regarding the MTD cuts that year). I got to experience developing the student body's stance on issues including the clout scandal and Chief's Next Dance). Thank you for giving us an insider's perspective.  If I may ask, how important do you think the student government's independence from the administration is?  Is the $60,000+ budget they are asking for justifiable, or is there a significant amount of wasted spending there?\n\nI ask because I there are some items from last year's spending--such as thousands spent on some sort of Big 10 student government conference--make me curious whether some money is spent on the senators and not on the functioning of the senate.\n\n(edit: some words)  No. As a suggestion, they can fine the smoking people and make that money.  This is actually how the first student government at UIUC funded themselves. Later governments stopped because it was really, really annoying... I was being sarcastic actually. Although I don't smoke I have no problem with the people smoking outside.

The really sad thing is that the senate is getting away from their true purpose and that is to stand up for the students not promote themselves through outrageous $9000 cheesy advertisements at sporting events.  I wasn't able to attend last weeks meeting, but since I was recently reappointed, I had a couple of senators on my behalf fight against a fund allocation for a 10 dollar name plate for me. I didn't want it, and I sure didn't want my constituents money spent on something that serves absolutely no purpose.  That is approximately 500 bucks wasted every year on stupid name plates.  Well apparently, there was a movement to amend the fund allocation to remove my nameplate, and it failed.  Fiscal irresponsibility at it's finest right there, and there is no reason there should be an additional fee if the ISS can't spend it's current budget wisely.

In my opinion, ISS continues to push itself further into obscurity.  Things have gotten notably worse within the organization.  They seem to spend a majority of their time talking about fund allocations and internal procedure, and less time on ways to represent students.  I can't say that I've ever heard more people use the word \"distinguished\" in a single meeting.     Is there a timeline for when this will be brought up in a meeting or when students can vote?     Many people here do not have a lot of money and many of them are on student loans. As a result, they should not be forced to pay additional fees, especially if there are having difficulty paying for tuition. If they want to implement a mandatory fee, it should only be for people who have extra money to spend.\n\nIf the Student Government needs money, I will gladly donate at least $10 if they give me an easy way to do so such as allowing me to charge the donation to my student account.\n  http://iss.illinois.edu/documents.asp\n\nA link to the ISS governing documents and their site for anyone who wants to look at such things.

I'm trying to think of the name of the stylist I really didn't like. I think it was Lindsey. She gave me an awful cut. I have thick straight/wavy hair, so it's not too difficult to cut, but she really butchered it. And my bangs ended up uneven and a little ragged looking. My appointment was right before her lunch break, and it was hot in the salon. She turned on a fan, and one of the other stylists said, \"don't you want that fan off to cut her hair, especially her bangs?\" My hairdresser thought it would be fine, but midcut she said, \"Oh, maybe I do want that fan off...\"\n\nNot words you want to hear during a hair cut. oh... that is odd how long ago was this? only stylists i really know and have cut my hair are rebecca, jake, and doug. they always did an amazing job sucks to hear that she fucked your hair up...     I like Terra at Kane &amp; Co. She used to be at H2O and she can do a lot of different styles. Might be a bit expensive though.   Landon's, ask for Jesssica.  33$ cut, blow and style for women.  21$ for guys.\n\nEdit: almost 4 years with her as my stylist. What are their hours?\n\nWhy are they so much more expensive? Shampoo+cut costs ~$17 for women at MasterCuts at the mall.",
