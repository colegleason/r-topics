    "snippet" : "  He uses his name on 4chan? This guy.... The size of his ego, of course he was a tripfag. Not sure if it was just plain and simple ego or (quite understandable) psychological issues. I feel like heartless, intrusive, stalking paparazzi for even posting this, but he kind of seemed to want to draw attention to himself. \n\nFindings from News-Gazette article, Circuit Clerk webpage, google, comments on /r/uiuc by people who knew him:\n\n1. Mother died two years back (possibly from cancer?)\n1. Older parents (mother born in 1949, ECEHacker in 1991, father currently in late 70s)\n1. Only child - no siblings\n1. Homeschooled\n1. Socially awkward\n1. Rich - possibly easy access to money for buying keyloggers, PVC pipes, etc. (I have no idea how much these cost)\n1. Has run some marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks.\n1. Showing off his technical/hacking knowledge and skills seemed to be a prime source of self-esteem/self-worth for him.\n\nSo my amateur assessment of his psychological profile (I am not a psychologist or psych major):\n\nECEHacker being an only child and being homeschooled had no close relationships except with his mother, and must have been devastated when she died. If she was sick for some time he must have been experiencing chronic, high-level stress for some period of time. Being socially awkward he didn't make friends here and probably didn't have skills to deal with grief/loss. If he was egotistical he probably didn't want to seek counseling and believed he could handle it by himself. Running seems to have been an outlet but he probably needed more stuff to regain the attention that he missed now that his mother wasn't there to give him that anymore. He seemed to have posted the first post about the hacking himself, as /u/ECEStudent2012, to draw attention to himself. Not sure if he is evil (probably not) or just a confused, disoriented guy with poor life skills and in difficult circumstances crying out for attention.\n Most of what you said sounds accurate, but he probably had at least a few friends despite his social awkwardness. One of my friends in ECE has a favorable opinion of him and said that he was friends with ECEHacker.\n Yeah now that I think of it grief about the loss of his mother might be an oversimplification and might not be the *only* reason for his attention-seeking behavior. We don't know much of his history, like why was he homeschooled? Did he get into trouble at school and was expelled (like he has been from college)? Or was he bullied? Or could he not adjust socially, or did he have learning disabilities? (I am not knowledgeable about why children are homeschooled or how they get admitted into college without high school grades).  I have no idea about ECEHacker's situation, but keep in mind that being homeschooled does not mean you keep no records. (It also doesn't mean you're socially inept. Hooray for stereotypes.) I received grades for every class I took in high school, many of which were taken outside the home anyway.  I just wasn't enrolled in a public or private school.  I had no problem getting into accredited postsecondary institutions, and now I'm a grad student here.  \n\nMany colleges accept self-made high school transcripts signed by parents, perhaps with documentation from the local school board certifying that the student has been enrolled in a home education program.  For me, it wasn't much of an issue because I was (1) dual-enrolled in a commmunity college part-time for 10th-12th grades and (2) scored highly on the SAT.  If I had scored badly on the SAT/ACT, no doubt my high grades on my transcript would have been called into question.   I really don't know anything about homeschooling, so sorry I made assumptions. I assumed that since conventional schooling is the norm, there must be a really good reason for someone to be homeschooled. I only know what I read on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling):\n\n&gt; The three reasons that are selected by the majority of homeschooling parents in the United States are concern about the school environment, to provide religious or moral instruction, and dissatisfaction with academic instruction at public and private schools.\n \nYou say:\n\n&gt; Many colleges accept self-made high school transcripts signed by parents\n\nCan't parents inflate grades then? \n\nIf you don't mind sharing, why were you homeschooled? Were you homeschooled all through kindergarten to high school or just a few years? How did you make friends your own age? Not sure if it was just plain and simple ego or (quite understandable) psychological issues.

    "snippet" : "   Koch Media GmbH is *not* the same as the Koch Brothers things, right? I am glad that Volition is staying in town since it's probably the second coolest place in CU (Wolfram is number one, obvi.) How is Wolfram as a workplace? (I'm assuming you work there?) I worked at Wolfram for five years. I started off as Help Desk and when I left my title was still Help Desk, even though I was running a decent part of their *nix infrastructure by that point.\n\nWolfram is far and away the *worst* place I've ever worked in an IT capacity. I'd wager that it's based on your visibility within the company, though...If you stay off the radar and Stephen never notices you, you might be fine...As long as you can handle the low pay.\n\nThey tried to make it somewhat \"fun\" and \"relaxed.\" Free soda and other beverages, a foosball table, etc...But the pay sucked, working anywhere near Stephen or anyone else in his family was a total drag and telling people \"no\"---even if you were completely justified---would get you in real trouble.\n\nI could go on...But I'm out of time for now. I'd avoid Wolfram at all costs. Work somewhere---anywhere---else, and you'll be doing yourself a favor. &gt; I started off as Help Desk and when I left my title was still Help Desk\n\nSo you were an application support specialist?\n\nI am also curious why they call themselves \"Wolfram Research\"? What research do they do? MATLAB developers call themselves only \"The Mathworks\".\n\nStephen Wolfram did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/) a while back and there was a lot of angst against him in the comments. He says he lives in Boston, so isn't the Champaign branch free from (what seems like) his tantrums? They still seem to have a fair number of employees and seem to be one of the major employers in town after the university and the hospitals.\n\nThanks for your reply! Internal Help Desk, part of the IT group. I left Wolfram in 2005 so department and position names may have changed. The external support groups at Wolfram are Tech Support and Customer Service. You call Customer Service when Mathematica chokes on your license key and you call Tech Support when you can't figure out how to get something to work right in Mathematica.\n\nApparently you'd call Help Desk if you were an employee and you needed an Office upgrade...You'd tell us you'll be leaving your computer at your desk while you're at a meeting...But you take your laptop and leave the external monitor. I have *lots* of stories like this...\n\nNo idea about why they're called Wolfram Research, Inc.\n\nWhen I worked there, Stephen was still in the process of moving to Boston from Chicago. Most of SW's time was spent in Chicago, but he would come down regularly---at least for every company meeting and usually more often---to wreak havoc, fire entire departments, call us all blithering idiots, etc. Good times.\n\nWhen SW lived in Chicago and his home network stopped working, guess who he called? Us. In Champaign. So some poor sysadmin---I was never \"lucky\" enough to get this task---would drive up and work on his stuff, usually literally being screamed at by SW the entire time. SW got one sysadmin so worked up he ended up puking from the stress while he was there. Not cool.\n\nI was the technical lead for a project, the goal being migrating our 3,500 mailing lists---note, at the time we only had 300 employees, so let that sink in for a minute---and all their archives from Majordomo/MHonArc to Mailman. The project was a slam dunk for me...Pretty straightforward. Of course, SW's brother Conrad was overall \"in charge\" of the project. I banged heads all the time with Conrad about his decisions that weakened the project from a technical or support point of view...He hated the way the Mailman footers looked in messages, so he wanted them turned off. I lobbied long and hard for why that footer should remain on---it gives you easy access to your settings for the list, easy access to the archives and a few other reasons---but was finally told by my IT supervisor to \"just turn the thing off.\" So I did. Then forwarded all support calls for people asking how to get to the Mailman archives or list settings to Conrad's phone.\n\nThe footer got turned back on. :) \"I never realized there would be *that* *many* support questions.\" That's just it...They make decisions about stuff like that there without listening to the tech geeks' opinions.\n\nThis project got \"taken away\" from me a week or so later, cause I wasn't cooperative enough. That was literally the reason the project got taken away. \"Conrad feels you are not agreeing with him often enough.\" I said, \"great! Someone else can deal with Conrad.\"\n\nThe gave me that project back a month later, mostly cause Conrad hated the other guy even more...I may have been opinionated, but at least I made sense.\n\nThat's how it goes there. It's an unholy combination up top of academic refugees and corporate micro-management.\n\nI've always heard it said that \"Wolfram is a great place to have worked,\" and that's absolutely true. It *does* look good on a resume, has a pretty low bar for entry in most cases---will work for peanuts seems to be about all that's required---and can expose you to a pretty large group of people in various fields, all of which are looking to get out as fast as they can. :)\n\nThe only real bright spot at that place is the people. I've met some of the most talented, most interesting people I've ever encountered at Wolfram, a lot of whom are still friends of mine since I---and a good number of them---left the company. Some of us still socialize and a lot of us work to hire people from Wolfram after we're gone. It's a great source of talent. Excellent post. Why do you think Wolfram turns out to be a great source of talent? I'm not involved, but I'm going to guess it's because it's in the University's backyard with a low cost of entry (You can walk to the interview from from the senior laden Champaign housing and the requirements are not too stringent) &gt; low cost of entry\n\nWhat do you mean by that? Can you elaborate further? Excellent post. Why do you think Wolfram turns out to be a great source of talent? Koch Media GmbH is *not* the same as the Koch Brothers things, right? I am glad that Volition is staying in town since it's probably the second coolest place in CU (Wolfram is number one, obvi.) GmbH means it was incorporated in Germany. It's not the same.  I hope they're okay with this decision, I remember hearing that they were worried about the whole THQ situation to begin with from classes. I wonder if any of them visit /r/uiuc...",

    "snippet" : "The GI bill looks nice, but then you are years older than everyone else, and a little off your academic game.  Would you do it again if given the choice?  Why or why not?  \n\nAlso, what branch were you in and how long did you serve?  Hi there.\n\nI served 4 years in the Air Force, separating last spring.  I started Parkland in the fall, with plans to transfer to U of I for it's Computer Science program after two years.\n\nI joined the military when I was 20.  I regret the two years I wasted inbetween high school and the military FAR, FAR more than my time in service.  The benefits are numerous and awesome.\n\nBeing older has only been a blessing.  During group projects, younger members often look up to me to set the pace for the work. Being older and serving years under strict authority (Well, Air Force. . . so kind of strict) means I interact very well with my teachers, who see me as professional, motivated, and capable.\n\nI'm not saying young people cannot have those qualities, but you can bet your study habits and work ethics will be in place if you've served before.\n\nI was very nervous at first attending school again. I graduated high school in 2006 as a smart but lazy student and was never a fan of math.  The faculty at Parkland have been nothing short of AMAZING in helping me adjust and I finished my first semester with a 4.0. Maybe after a deployment to Afghanistan Algebra doesn't seem that tough.  Who knows?\n\nAnd the G.I. bill is everything you'd imagine.  It pays full tuition, $1000 a year for books/fees, and I get about $1200 a month tax free to just pay bills on.  It's too good in my opinion.  On top of that you can collect the full Pell grant.  I'm able to list being a student as my full time job, and still make more money than my employed girlfriend.  It's really let me enjoy my time in school.\n\nIf you want to know anything else just ask.  Are you in the position of deciding whether you want to join college or the military?  You should really check out somewhere like /r/veterans or even /r/military to get some more opinions. This basically echoes my feelings and situation too, except I really didn't enjoy the Army as an organization. I did love the people I worked with though. They were absolutely fantastic.\n\nSheep, did you sign up with the old GI Bill and convert to the new one, or did you just get the new one right off the bat? I think I might be one of the few (read: the lucky) because I signed up and kept the old GI Bill, AND I had the Army College Fund on top of that. In short, I get like ~$2600/month (tax free) and the IL Veterans Grant pays for all my tuition and fees. It's pretty hard to complain with that arrangement. I came in under the Montgomery, and chose to give it up in order to take the GI Bill.  I could have used the Montgomery for 4 years then the GI Bill for 1, but the loss of 3 years of BAH (The $1200 every month is only for the GI Bill) was a no brainer to me. Interesting. So can I assume you weren't an IL resident when you joined? Otherwise it would have been more profitable to keep the old GI Bill because it's paying ~$1600 per month right now, and the tuition would have been covered by IVG. Regardless, it would appear you're doing fine so keep up the good work! :) Hi there.\n\nI served 4 years in the Air Force, separating last spring.

It's pretty decent and somewhat historical. Hugh Hefner got his idea for playboy bunnies here.     Meadowbrook Park on Windsor is a nice place to go for a walk if you don't feel like getting off a paved path.  If you guys are into thrifting, The Habitat ReStore in Champaign (On University Ave between First and Second) is excellent. They don't have any clothes, but they have a great selection of home goods. \n\nThey have three levels: The upstairs is books, home decor, dishes, kitchen gadgets, lamps, pillows, etc. The main floor is furniture and electronics. The basement is building materials and tools (they have used doors, appliances, garden stuff...) I just noticed they're having a 50% off furniture sale tomorrow. fyi     ",

I go out into the main room and he's spray painting his PVC breathing apparatus black **and all the windows were closed**.

Can someone link to this reddit post they speak of? the supposed ECE Hacker did an AMA here on /r/uiuc a while back. It was deleted because he basically just ended up asking himself questions and then answering them. Can someone link to this reddit post they speak of?  Why would we suspect the keyloggers and the \"tampering with locks\" to be the same person? &gt; After the first incident, where one lock was damaged, an e-mail was sent out from a professor's account with information about the vandalism, but the professor hadn't authored the email, Geis said.\n\nSounds like his M.O, at least. I guess \"makes the lock inoperable\" to me sounds like random mischief. Maybe it was supposed to imply that he used this method to break into a locked building?   I wonder how the roommates feel?  Also why would he would not be attending UIUC yet live on campus?    Again remember the importance of innocent until proven guilty. So there are connections that do not fully prove he was responsible(Doesn't mean the cops don't have anything). We got some websites he visited and a supposed confession which may or may not have that much weight.  Yeah. I'm not seeing much to link him to the lock tampering and fraudulent email - at least not from the article. There's a post linking an alias of his with the hacking of TA accounts, but it's all kind of inconclusive without directly linking one of his machines to the post. The packaging sounds like it could be damning, but we don't really know enough yet to tell.\n\nHe definitely sounds like a douche from what others here have said, but I'd hesitate to rush to judgement. This could be an unfortunate collision of CITES finding evidence of something similar (the TA hacking), some attention seeking bragging, and the police saying \"Wait, I remember this guy. He was weird...\".   Why?

Honestly, after reading all the stories about this kid and the shit he was making, now that he got busted I hope he doesnt freak out Yeah, one of the charges brought against him during his arraignment yesterday is:\n\n    FIREARM W/O VALID FOID/ELIG  \n\nThe News-Gazette article doesn't mention anything about a firearm. This is the most serious of the 5 charges against him (it's a Class A felony). The details of the other charges (criminal damage to property, computer fraud, forgery) are available on the Champaign County Circuit Clerks's [webpage](https://secure.jtsmith.com/clerk/yytt331s.asp) (seach for his name in the criminal division).\n Oh fuck. I dont like that one bit... really really dont like that   What legal right did the investigators have to take his roomates computers and phones? What legal right did the investigators have to take his roomates computers and phones?  He was in my ECE 391 class last semester, interesting that the article says he wasn't a registered student. ",

    "snippet" : "Hello, I've been recently appointed to the Illinois Student Senate Committee on Campus Safety and I wanted to know what concerns and suggestions /r/UIUC has to improve campus safety. Any suggestions will be considered and are greatly appreciated. Thank you guys so much. Let's make campus a safer place!  I think bike lanes need be more thoughtfully laid out in some areas so they don't abruptly end or begin. For example, when bike riders (like myself) are heading east on Armory, when they get to 4th, there is no easy way to get onto the bike path that runs by the sidewalk adjacent to the Armory. I've seen a lot of people have to continue in the street and it really makes drivers nervous to have them riding alongside them, especially if they stay off the bike path all the way to the light at 6th and Armory. Basic things like that. I think bike lanes need be more thoughtfully laid out in some areas so they don't abruptly end or begin.

Basic things like that.   Suggestions:\n\n* Make security whistles and pepper sprays widely available (kind of like the cold packs and contraceptives at McKinley). Right now only those people who take the initiative to buy them possess them.\n* Make SafeRides more responsive. Don't turn down requests for rides and ask the caller to take the bus because the bus stop is only 2 blocks away. A lot can happen in 2 blocks in a dark, scarcely populated neighborhood at 2 AM, or even at 9 PM. Yes, a few people will take advantage of this and end up using SafeRides as a free taxi service, but I think that is a reasonable cost to bear if more people can be safe. I feel like the saferides issue is my biggest concern. I have never been able to get saferides to cooperate with me once to take me home despite being really close to campus, so by the time I'm even on campus i just resort to a bus.  The purpose of 335 SafeRides, which is agreed upon by the University of Illinois and Illinois Student Senate, is to \"provide safe transportation to individuals who are generally traveling alone when **no other means of safe transportation are available** within the designated boundaries.\" The [boundaries](http://www.cumtd.com/maps-and-schedules/route/335-saferides/weekday/night/map) reach just beyond the UI campus. As you can see on this map, there are five MTD routes that offer late-night fixed-route service (after midnight): 50 Green, 100 Yellow, 120 Teal, 130 Silver, and 220 Illini. These routes cover a tremendous amount of ground and operate with 10 and 20 minute frequency.\n\nThere are rules to riding SafeRides. When someone calls, they will be asked questions their origin and destination as well as how many people they are with. \"There is a maximum limit of three persons per pick-up location, except at the Illini Union, ISR, and the Main Library at Armory &amp; Wright. 335 SafeRides **does not duplicate fixed-route service already provided by MTD.** 335 SafeRides does not provide emergency transportation service to medical facilities. **335 SafeRides does not provide service to and from the bars.**\"\n\nTo read between the lines, if there are groups greater than three people travelling together there is a fair assumption that there is safety in numbers. For students who are on campus and travelling to a densely populated area like a residence hall, the Illini Union, or a library, fixed-route service is perfectly suited and much more available. But for students who are starting and/or ending at destinations that are remote such as off-campus apartments, campus buildings or labs located in corridors not served by fixed-routes - SafeRides is a valid option.\n\nAs CJS7070 mentioned, wait times would be increased if students within a reasonable walking distance were all granted a SafeRide. Students make requests for SafeRides even when both their origin and destination are on fixed route service. Students will move themselves further from fixed-route service and call MTD again in hopes of reversing a denied SafeRide. This is unfortunate, but a regular challenge of providing the service.\n\nIn answer to simplyxsilly and AlmostGrad100, there are two SafeRides vans in operation Sunday through Wednesday and three SafeRides vans Thursday through Saturday during the UI Fall and Spring Semesters. CJS7070 was correct that MTD added to SafeRides service in the recent transportation contract renegotiation for 2012-2015. The additions included the extra van Thursday through Saturday as well as adding SafeRides service serving during the Fall, Winter, and Spring Breaks.\n\nMTD and the University of Illinois want students to use SafeRides and fixed-route services when travelling at night.

Is there anyway for, say, MTD to coordinate with SafeWalks so that people who call in a ride, but are, say, 2 blocks from a stop, can get safewalks called for them?  Even a student-based organization for safewalks would be a good idea. I transferred from a school with a paid student security team, and one of their big responsibilities was walking with people at night if they felt unsafe. Most of the time this was as simple as walking them across campus to their car. It was utilized by students and staff. I feel like the saferides issue is my biggest concern. I have never been able to get saferides to cooperate with me once to take me home despite being really close to campus, so by the time I'm even on campus i just resort to a bus.  I think that's the point - if you're within a certain distance of a bus that will get you to your destination, you need to use that service instead. \n\nPeople say SafeRides service is slow now; imagine if it also picked up everyone who requested a pickup despite their proximity to a fixed service location.

Sounds good except for the pepper spray part.  It's not an effective tool for stopping an attacker.  Speaking from experience. Really, were you attacked and did the pepper spray further aggravate the attacker? I have wondered about this, whether pepper spray does disorient the attacker or does it aggravate them. I am sorry that you had an experience like that. Relax it was part of a non-lethal course when I was active duty.  \nIf you can hit someone in their open eye with your pepper spray it should (but not guaranteed) stun them for a few seconds.  But can you draw it, and spray accurately, and make sure their eye is open faster than they can grab you? If you can then do it and run like hell because after that initial shock (if you nailed an open eyeball) you can still see.  And yeah, it's aggravating, so much so that I don't care who or what you are, if I get sprayed ever again I will latch on to that person and keep hitting until they stop moving.  If someone wants to hurt you I promise pepper spray will make them want to hurt you more. It was never meant to be a tool for self defense.\n\nThe fact that you recommend it without ever having tried it on yourself is very irresponsible, feel free to try it.  Have a friend spray you, but it's painful and it lasts for hours. Sounds good except for the pepper spray part.  It's not an effective tool for stopping an attacker.  Speaking from experience. Do you have any recommendations given your experience? Suggestions:\n\n* Make security whistles and pepper sprays widely available (kind of like the cold packs and contraceptives at McKinley).

Is it only one now? It has been quite a while since I used a SafeRide, but a driver once told me that they have 10 vans (if I remember correctly) operating at peak hours (maybe 10 PM - 4 AM). Even that is a pretty low number in my opinion. I found [this article](http://www.cumtd.com/the-inside-lane/2012/02/27/uiuc-transportation-fee/) which says that an increase in the number of SafeRides was one of the primary requests that the Illinois Student Senate made last year to MTD. \n\nI also think they shouldn't deny requests which sound like taxi service requests, like people wanting rides to/from parties or bars or restaurants or grocery stores. They shouldn't treat requests for rides from libraries/departments to dorms/apartments as the only legitimate requests. Denying SafeRides isn't going to stop people from going to parties or bars, and if they don't want to spend $15 on a cab they will end up having drunk people walking back who will be less alert and more vulnerable to crime.

To be quite honest, I'd like to get into another discussion: How safe is the U of I to the rest of Champaign/Urbana and other college campuses? The amount of crime alerts that we get and how it fluctuates sorta skews perceptions (mine, at least) of how many crimes there actually are.\n\nTo me, it seems that a lot of the crime alerts that we are emailed are the same type of crime - someone walking out alone at night that just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. On a campus this size, where many people are out during the middle of the night for various reasons and have various levels of awareness, odds are eventually someone will be unfortunately robbed. I'm not saying that nothing can be dome about the crime here - I hope there are some real improvements and that you can make some big changes - but to what extent can the university enforce safety policy in campustown, which would only be the Uni Police (please correct me if I'm wrong)? The data is out of date, but the site is still useful. Check http://campuscrime.net, which was made by a journalism class here. It explores some of the issues you brought up.  From [http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf](http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf) for 2011,\n\nArrests for rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft:  93  \n\nArrests for liquor and \"Drug abuse\" (because anyone who uses drugs is an abuser, right?  Nevermind, I don't need you to read from the student handbook):  464\n\nJudicial referrals for liquor and \"drug abuse\":  1028\n\nInstead of undercover cops at bars; why not local gangs?  Instead of finding intoxicated minors;  finding burglars?  Instead of looking for people carrying open liquor;  carrying weapons?\n\nAnyway, I feel safe on campus.  At least, I feel as safe as I do anywhere else.\n\nEdit:  Slight change for clarity Those are some nice stats you have there, but you have to take into account the sheer number of \"rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft\" that happen are ten folds smaller than the number of underage drinkers/ drug abusers. \n\nAlso  cops don't give a shit if you're drunk. It's when you are drunk and doing really stupid shit, that's when you get a ticket.  &gt;Those are some nice stats you have there, but you have to take into account the sheer number of \"rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft\" that happen are ten folds smaller than the number of underage drinkers/ drug abusers. \n\nAnd the number of arrests that occur for the amount of crimes committed are vastly smaller as well.  You do know that the majority of rapes go unreported, right?  Or look at the other person who responded to my post.  Most people who are mugged/robbed don't even file a police report, because the police don't care/can't do anything about it.\n\nRegardless, that's sort of beside my point, and was only suppposed to be used as an illustrative tool.  What's more important to the people who are paying to go to school here?  Or the kids' parents who sent them here?  That the kids don't drink or that they don't get mugged?  That their child isn't raped or that they don't smoke pot?  \n\nI don't know what the statistics are, but I'd like to see a survey of the campus police departments or the people who are in the administration of the school.  How many of them drank underage or did illegal drugs?  Considering that teen drinking rates have dropped since the 1960s, and that we still have 80% of people under 21 having drank, I'd think it's a very safe assumption that the majority committed the same illegal acts.  IT SURE RUINED THEIR LIVES, RIGHT?  THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SAFER IF WE GAVE THEM A TICKET.\n\n&gt;Also cops don't give a shit if you're drunk. It's when you are drunk and doing really stupid shit, that's when you get a ticket. \n\nNot really, just being in the wrong place at the wrong time is enough. From [http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf](http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf) for 2011,\n\nArrests for rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft:  93  \n\nArrests for liquor and \"Drug abuse\" (because anyone who uses drugs is an abuser, right?  Nevermind, I don't need you to read from the student handbook):  464\n\nJudicial referrals for liquor and \"drug abuse\":  1028\n\nInstead of undercover cops at bars; why not local gangs?  Instead of finding intoxicated minors;  finding burglars?  Instead of looking for people carrying open liquor;  carrying weapons?\n\nAnyway, I feel safe on campus.  At least, I feel as safe as I do anywhere else.\n\nEdit:  Slight change for clarity Definitely agree about focusing more on violent crimes rather than drinking tickets, but that seems unlikely to change as the city makes a lot of money handing out drinking tickets. Something else to keep in mind is that the University doesn't report all the crime going on in the campus area. A couple years ago I was assaulted on Green St in front of Za's around 2 in the morning (many people were still out and about), and when I went to the campus safety building to report it, the cop basically told me that the University police wouldn't even report it since there was basically nothing they could do about it.  People not understanding the difference between sidewalks and bike paths. Also bikers not understanding the difference between bike paths and sidewalks. Lets all ride our bikes down the quad when it's ridiculously busy! Seems like a fantastic idea Also bikers not understanding the difference between bike paths and sidewalks.  I always ride my bike. It wasn't for a safety reason, but thinking about it now, I think it's a safer way to travel.  I may be alone in this, but I have always found the lighting on campus (esp. the main quad) to be way too dim, more like mood lighting than anything else. I'd like big bright lights around campus. \n\nI'd also like to see the \"safety tips\" in the crime alerts to go away or be revised severely. The tone of them is very victim-blaming to me. People have the right to safe travel on campus at night, and shouldn't be made to feel guilty if they can't round up a posse for safety every time they go out. \n\nEDIT: As the comments have descended into a debate on victim blaming, here's something I'd like to see in the safety tips: What the fuck do I do if I am getting mugged? Do I do what the guy says? Do I curl up in a ball to protect my voonerables or do I fight back? Should I carry a decoy wallet like the Europeans do in mugging areas?

Telling a person to take measures to protect them self from harm is not \"victim blaming\" \n\nBut no, instead, let's tell criminals not to do bad things.  They always listen right? You can only control your own actions, your safety is up to you. Most rapes are by acquaintances. Usually they tend to rationalize things and not see themselves as criminals. The \"common sense\" tips they tend to dispense, like not walking alone in the dark doesn't help in these circumstances. Telling people what rape is and HOW not to be a rapist would help in this type of situation.\n Most rapes are by acquaintances.

It's almost all student housing between University and Kirby and Neil and Lincoln (or Race?). I'd like to know when there is an uptick in criminal activity on my street or block, which is where I'll be walking to in the late night and early hours, rather than just what is happening around the quads and dorms. Well, that pretty much encompasses the entire campus.... keep in mind, the crime alerts are mainly for the university, not for CU as a whole.     Enforcement of bicycling laws - I was hit (not hard) on Green Street underneath one of many signs that say \"No bikes\" that are posted every 50 feet or so on Green Street yet are universally ignored and not enforced. I also dodge cyclists almost daily riding west on East John that blow the red light in front of Swanlund to cross Sixth and proceed the wrong way on East John (which turns into a one-way at this point headed east) while barely missing pedestrians crossing East John in the marked crossing with the walk signal on.  Concealed Carry. Concealed Carry. IIRC, carrying on campus is an expulsion worthy offense under the student code. Concealed Carry. **Pros:** Would, for the most part, deter attacks that we associate with crime alters.\n\n**Cons:** In college, many people consume lots of alcohol. Guns would not be a good addition to that.\n\nIn principle, the idea makes sense - no one is going to fuck with people if there is a possibility anyone is carrying. At the same time, all the drunkness in college, and other issues like stolen guns and people who use bad judgement while the carry could make even worse problems than robbery. I understand your point well, but the difference between concealed carry and not **to me** is this - when there's no concealed carry, I have to watch out for that one person that's hiding from me at night; when there is concealed carry, I have to watch out for any bad situation or altercation or people that seem unstable any time, day or night.  That's a perfectly reasonable concern, fortunately most carry laws prohibit you from carrying while intoxicated and/or in a bar.  That doesn't mean that people won't break the law, but if people aren't carrying now because it's against the law it stands to reason that they won't carry when it's still against the law. Oh yeah, I'm sure there won't be guns allowed in bars, but you never know what will happen during those many pregames. *Anyone* carrying a gun would scare me. Mental fitness varies with time, and even the possibility that someone might be lax about their weapon would scare me.  A person who was mentally fit at the time they bought the gun might get depressed, stressed, intoxicated, drunk, high, addicted, fail out of school, have a break-up, lose a loved one, and that might affect their mental health - no one can accurately predict a person's future mental health, and unless the government keeps track of every gun owner's mental health on a daily/weekly basis, I would feel very afraid if I knew everyone was carrying guns, and walk on eggshells trying very hard not to upset anyone because who knows when they might snap.   I think people are less fragile than you give them credit for.\n\nI suppose I could make all the standard arguments against what you're saying (but I would feel like an ass), so I'm mostly curious why you think this way. I think I just explained why I felt that way. Only one person needs to snap to kill 20 people. In a university with 40,000 students, even if the probability of that happening is 1/40,000 that would be too great a risk. A mass shooting making front-page news every month or so does nothing to dispel my fears. \n\nAlso, it's not so much a question of fragility as emotional stability *in the moment*. A drunk person might be normally stable when not drunk, but might have poor judgment and poor impulse control while drunk. And universities have young people with less maturity and less impulse control and more testosterone and adrenaline than the general population, and they are also under stress (academic, moving away from home, etc.). I really don't think you would want to add guns to this mix. Granted, not everyone snaps, in fact the vast majority doesn't, but even if the probability is 10^-4 , it's 4 people and that's 4 people too many. I think 1 in 40000 is way over estimating. Using your example of a mass-shooting making the news every month (and assuming all of those happen in this country) that is only 12/300,000,000 (approximately 4X10^-8 percent of the population (if we use 40000 as the campus population that makes 0.0016 people violent psychopaths)).\n\nThat's not to say I think everyone should be able to carry a concealed firearm (I'm in favor of background checks and mandatory training), but I hope that gives a bit of perspective. Rough calculation: [Illinois has ~1.2 million gun owners](http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/illinois/number-of-illinois-gun-owners-jumped-in/article_bcd7271d-28d1-54bb-b67d-87e498864b82.html), and the [intentional homicide rate is ~6 per 100,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#United_States). The [population of Illinois is 12 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), so that is a rate of 6x10^-5 when 1/10 th of the population owns guns. If everyone owned a gun, the rate would be 6x10^-4 , 24 times higher than 1 in 40,000 (= 2.5x10^-5 ). *Anyone* carrying a gun would scare me. Mental fitness varies with time, and even the possibility that someone might be lax about their weapon would scare me.  A person who was mentally fit at the time they bought the gun might get depressed, stressed, intoxicated, drunk, high, addicted, fail out of school, have a break-up, lose a loved one, and that might affect their mental health - no one can accurately predict a person's future mental health, and unless the government keeps track of every gun owner's mental health on a daily/weekly basis, I would feel very afraid if I knew everyone was carrying guns, and walk on eggshells trying very hard not to upset anyone because who knows when they might snap.   I have to agree to a large extent - I know people that use guns for sport and protection in their home, and that doesn't bother me at all. Also, our attitude toward guns is dependent on culture and environment - many western states have very lax gun laws and concealed carry is common. If we lived in one of those states and were exposed to those behaviors, maybe our feelings would be less apprehensive. \n\nWith that being said, the amount of trust that I would have to have from everyone around me if guns were concealed carry would be about the same as the amount of trust I wold have walking home in the middle of the night by myself, and that is not much. In short, I wouldn't feel safer in a situation where I or someone else has to actually use the gun; there are many more variables to consider when you can't be sure who does and who does not have a weapon. Of course, I would almost always be safe in a concealed carry environment, but the times that I'm not would outweigh the benefits in my situation.\n\n**EDIT:** Grammar &gt; Of course, I would almost always be safe in a concealed carry environment\n\nHow? In a hypothetical situation where everyone carries guns, how would you protect yourself if someone shoots you from behind? Or like the Aurora theater case, would you immediately be able to get your gun out in a dark theater and protect yourself? I think many people would be uncomfortable carrying a weapon at all times and would not do it even if it were legal. If we need to carry lethal weapons at *all* times to protect ourselves, then it means we trust our fellow men too less to be considered a civilized society. And sometimes weapons bought to protect yourself can be used against you, like the Newtown guy who used his mother's weapons against her. I don't think people can be trusted to be that meticulous and careful about their weapons, someone who lives in the same house is eventually going to figure out how to use them if they are determined to do so. My use of the phrase 'almost always be safe' was a reference to time, as in most of the time, we can trust people to not use their weapons in some sort of altercation, or worse, unprovoked. This is how I think about it - lets say there is a hypothetical situation where there is an altercation within a group of people and everyone has a concealed weapon. Most likely, no one would brandish their weapon because they would know that if they did, some one would retaliate and everyone in the room is in grave danger. Common sense would (hopefully) prevail.\n\nThe almost comes in due to cases that you just described - a situation like Aurora or Sandy Hook, which in a sense of any one person's probability of being in an incident of that nature is extremely low, but the consequences of that actually happening is so devastating that it wouldn't be reasonable to have concealed carry.\n\nI do agree with your opinion that most people would not carry weapons if there were lax gun laws because they aren't needed. With the law enforcement that we have today, its rarely necessary or even beneficial in a densely or even moderately populated area. The hypothetical situation you describe is actually what scares me most about concealed carry laws: groups of strangers \"self-defensing\" each other to death.\n\nAnd I say this having lived in Tennessee, where gun restrictions are absurdly loose.

Concealed Carry. Haha, good luck trying to get that to happen in this state.   [The SCOTUS ruled that Illinois laws banning concealed carry are unconstitional.](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-11/news/chi-us-appeals-court-strikes-down-states-concealedcarry-ban-20121211_1_court-strikes-appeals-court-david-sigale)\n\nI don't really know how it's going to work out, though.  Chances are good that it will just be near impossible to get a license for it. It was only a federal court, it won't likely go to the supreme court for strategic reasons. \n\nAs for the provisions themselves, they're likely going to be a middle ground. The courts gave Illinois a 180 day hiatus before all bans on conceal and carry are struck down. The republicans can block literally all progress and still essentially win. However, even the republicans don't want to see the laws just disappear as that would be chaotic and look bad for them. This means that the pro-gun side is going to have push beyond what their numbers may suggest. Also, the NRA is dedicating a lot of money to this so any for-sale politician will be in the pocket of the NRA by voting time. \n\nPersonally I'm hoping it ends up being a shall-issue system with mandatory training. May-issue systems end up being won't-issue for anyone but the rich and powerful. I've always wondered this since the decision came out, but if Illinois doesn't write a law that has a provision for concealed carry in the time frame, what happens?

    "title" : "Ex-U of I Foundation Student Caller's Thoughts on Campus Spirit Revival",
    "snippet" : "After seeing the progress of the Campus Spirit Revival facebook page over the last few weeks and how it is poorly managed, I feel that I must speak my thoughts. I used to work for the University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/, as a student caller who phoned alumni to receive donations for our university. The donations that UIF collects from Alumni is very essentially to funding all three U of I campuses, individual colleges, academics units, libraries, scholarships etc. UIF uses a standard computer phone banking software that dials an Alumnus, shows the student caller the Alum’s current job, address, graduation year and major, previous donations, etc. and then prompts a script for the student caller to say to the Alum. If an alum does not answer or if an alum does not want to donate the student caller has to code the call and a reason for why a donation was not given to U of I.\n\nThis is the point in which Campus Spirit Revival becomes relevant. One of the most common responses, to not giving donations to the University was because of the loss of the Chief. The response is so common that it is the first reason coded in the program when a caller codes why an alumni did not donate. UIF trains all of the student callers multiples times with mock calls as to how to deal with Alumni who are upset with the loss of the Chief and has pre-scripted responses as to try to alleviate the situation, and possibly still get the Alumnus to donate.\n\nThe number of calls in which Alumni told me that U of I lost them when they lost the Chief was discouraging. Granted a good number of Alumni calls were never answered, the ones that did answer either laughed, or regrettable told me “no” because of the Chief being gone and how the University does not care about the opinion of its Alumni. If an Alumnus was ever very upset about the Chief there was even a special comment coding that would go straight to the Chancellor’s Office for them to assess input from the Alumni. All student workers at UIF know this is an issue, as otherwise we would not be trained so heavily on it. While some veteran student callers may disagree slightly it is only because they are set in their ways and with their seniority only have to call Alumni who are yearly renewal, frequent donors. \n\nThe data of how many donations are lost to U of I due to the loss of the Chief and their relationship with Alumni in theory should be quantifiable by the UIF coding system, but a dollar amount cannot be expressed as UIF managers claim “we cannot put a value on the loss of each donation from an Alumnus not donating because of the loss of the Chief – because there is no donation”.\n\nAfter working evening after evening calling Alumni and hearing them upset with the loss of Chief and how the University does not care of their input as an Alum, but only desiring their money, I eventually became sickened with my pre-scripted responses for the Alumni. Talking with the Alumni, brought light to how out of touch our University Administration was with Alumni, and I began to become sickened that I had become a part of that system. I decided I could no longer do the job UIF required of me. I no longer believed in the bullshit they told us to tell Alumni, the scripts of why to still donate with the Chief gone, if an Alum was upset with U of I, etc, so I quit my job at UIF.\n\nI bring all of this up now, because the reality is, that every year this university loses a larger amount of donations from Alumni not only because of the loss of the Chief, but because Alumni feel disillusioned by how little the University cares about their opinion on matters, such as the Chief. The review of comments on the Campus Spirit Revival Facebook page is flooded with negative remarks from Alumni and terrible rebuttals from the admins of the Campus Spirit Revival page. If the University follows through with the input from Campus Spirit Revival - this poor representation, unworthy to be associated with U of I - will be a large insult to Alumni and will be viewed as U of I once again turning its back on Alumni opinion. I have recently been told that Chancellor Wise has appointed a Dean to oversee the outcome of Campus Spirit Revival and use their input. If this input is reviewed in the similar fashion of the smoking referendum results, then Campus Spirit Revival’s chosen mascot could be viewed by Chancellor Wise as input enough to put a motion forward. Should Campus Spirit Revival be backed by U of I or their results taken seriously by University Administration, I feel this could turn Alumni away from U of I on the same magnitude as if they removed the Chief a second time.\n\nPlease consider our U of I Alumni and how their donations fund this great university when making an opinion on Campus Spirit Revival. \nSupport Stop Campus Spirit Revival http://www.facebook.com/StopCampusSpiritRevival?fref=ts\n\nAnd when voting in Campus Spirit Revival’s farce of a contest, vote “No New Symbol”, as Good Alumni Relations and campus funding may just hang in the balance.\n  That's really sad to hear that this leaves such a wound with all the alums. I don't have strong feelings about the issue either way, but this really saddens me - not just because of the deterioration between a university and its current *and* former students, but mostly because of what I interpret this to imply: that the Chief, our mascot, is not only vital to the function and the image of our university, but it is the MOST IMPORTANT thing about this university. The responses seem to imply that this university is not worth the time or the energy if the Chief is no longer our mascot. They imply that the university should suffer because the Chief is no longer our mascot. It really saddening to hear that, even though this university does some corrupt things, that this is a great school that does some remarkable things, and all that seems to be for naught. I understand that the heart of the issue, the underlying issue is the arrogance of the administration to disenfranchise its own alumni, but I never thought that our mascot - our Chief - would be where everyone drew the line.\n\nSo I ask one question to you OP (and to anyone else who has some experience talking to alumni and talking about this issue) - does the anger stem from the loss of the Chief, or the betrayal of the administration to remove it? **tl'dr:**Essentially a long winded version is the arrogance of the administration as you pointed out. I don't think its the Chief in particular that draws the line though, I think its everything he represented and the way the administration went about getting rid of it. \n\nI think you kind of missed the point or at least what I believe the point of many of these Alumni would be.\n\nI think their disinterest is probably due to their perception that the University administration doesn't honor or respect the traditions of the University. I think tradition and legacy are naturally the things that keeps Alumni interested and obviously the University administration doesn't hold those concepts in the same regard as the Alumni do.\n\nObviously this isn't related to the Universities mission to educate at all, at which it does a great job. However I imagine a lot of the Alumni feel like this is no longer the institution they knew (my family had the record for the most students from one family here at one point, so there are a lot of Illini Alum in my family and I'd say thats a sentiment they would mostly agree with). I think that's the aspect of it that would make them reluctant to support the University.\n Traditions and values represented by the chief passed along from generation to generation - makes sense. I'll admit its hard for me to see things from that perspective; my second cousins and myself are the 1st generation to go to the U of I (most of my family went to Eastern). \n\nI'm sure there's some documentary or book or articles online, so I'll look for it later. But, if anyone would like to give their opinion, how has the chief come over the years to embody our collective values?  I think a lot of it had to do with his tenure as the mascot (Since 1926). Not only was the Chief or Mascot but he was also the logo of the University, I think he was the most visible symbol of our University.\n\nI think (though obviously many would certainly disagree) that he was dignified in a way that not many mascots are. He would only come out to dance at major events, and wasn't cheering along the sidelines or anything, he was something of serious business.\n\nI suspect the people wanting to remove the Chief and the controversy surrounding him had a lot to do with it. I think it is seen by many as an attack on our institutions traditions orchestrated by elements from outside the University. I suspect that aspect of it has a lot to do with the negative feelings over his departure.  And perhaps that what I was missing in all this. I see your point - the Chief isn't like most mascots where its some guy in a cartoonish animal suit, or even \"human\" mascots like the Fighting Irish mascot - the weird ass spastic leperchaun, or in light of recent events, Manti Te'o. There's a bit of reverence to it. \n\nI think what makes this such a divisive topic is that this is not just an issue of choice, it is an issue of what people identify with - an extension of the ego. This issue is a battle of pride and dignity; the adversaries are the competing perceptions of dignity between those who identify as pro-Chief, who view the Chief as an uniting embodiment of their pride and dignity as an insittution, and those who identify as anti-Chief, who view the Chief as an embodiment of the humiliation and stereotyping of native Americans. Either way will cause a loss of dignity and subsequent anger. The univeristy may have not had much of a choice about the Chief, but I wish that the aftermath was different. I hope that they try to empathize and relate to their students and alumni as much as possible, because it seems we need a way to display our pride and honor, and that there are a lot of bridges to rebuild. Indeed. It'll be interesting to see what happens with this movement for a new mascot.\n\nI imagine for a lot of Alumni (and me personally as a recent Alumnus) I'd rather have no mascot than a new one. Even if hes not allowed to dance anymore I think the Chief is still alive and well in the hearts of many members of the University of Illinois family. \n\nI think in another few decades though we'll see people being more open to changes in the mascot, when most Alumni don't remember the Chief and some of the intensity and anger of the debate has been reduced.

That's really sad to hear that this leaves such a wound with all the alums. I don't have strong feelings about the issue either way, but this really saddens me - not just because of the deterioration between a university and its current *and* former students, but mostly because of what I interpret this to imply: that the Chief, our mascot, is not only vital to the function and the image of our university, but it is the MOST IMPORTANT thing about this university. The responses seem to imply that this university is not worth the time or the energy if the Chief is no longer our mascot. They imply that the university should suffer because the Chief is no longer our mascot. It really saddening to hear that, even though this university does some corrupt things, that this is a great school that does some remarkable things, and all that seems to be for naught. I understand that the heart of the issue, the underlying issue is the arrogance of the administration to disenfranchise its own alumni, but I never thought that our mascot - our Chief - would be where everyone drew the line.\n\nSo I ask one question to you OP (and to anyone else who has some experience talking to alumni and talking about this issue) - does the anger stem from the loss of the Chief, or the betrayal of the administration to remove it? I would say that all universities have difficulty managing the expectations of their alumni, but ours fell extremely short when dealing with the issue of the Chief and thus left Alumni disillusioned with the University of Illinois they thought they knew. I think that by not taking into large consideration of what Alumni preferred, and what Alumni valued to be a part of ILLINOIS tradition, the administration created a group of ILLINI Alumni that were bonded much stronger than before as the group now had a large sense of connection of being for the past traditions of Illinois - what they felt made Illinois great - and against what the University administration now determines what is ILLINI tradition. The loss of the Chief was a catalyst that not only created disunity between the University and Alumni but created large unity between Alumni and the current students that do not get to experience the Chief and the values and traditions of U of I. The loss of the Chief was not a mascot to these Alumni but a symbol and logo that represented the values and traditions of what makes the University of Illinois great. Moreover, the Chief as a symbol collectively tied together the generations, that came through the university and was passed down through the students that fueled and made U of I a better place for all. When the decision came to remove the Chief, as an Alum you would expect the first person to back your tradition would be your University, but they pressured by the NCAA. This is where I feel the resentment towards U of I began, and from that point on the University should have dealt better with Alumni relations - and maybe they did - but it was not enough. Perhaps the administration underestimated the negative aftermath that could be created by Alumni relations or took Alumni for granted, but in the end not only donations, but also sporting events ticket sales have suffered largely. \n\nAt this point, I feel that the appointment or the process of finding a new symbol or mascot will only create more division between the Alumni and the University. We hold one of the largest living Alumni bases in the country, and while there will always be those who will support U of I no matter what, there is still a huge group that could be supporting us to the extend of the loyalty and donations of Notre Dame's Alumni. There is no reason to further aggravate or possibly insult our Alumni by using the results of Campus Spirit Revival (which Chancellor Wise at present, may very well do). Campus Spirit Revival has been a trivial search process (with the probable intention of a resume addition) that is poorly managed, and inconsiderate of Alumni and their dissenting opinion, that I can only foresee this birthing a negative outcome and ripple effect among Alumni and current students alike.  I feel like this Campus Spirit Revival is just some attempt to wipe everything under the rug and pretend that the last 80 years never happened. I understand that the university has to comply to the NCAA because forfeiting playoff games would essentially destroy the sports program, but the university doesn't seem to want to have any discussion about how to proceed. After all, mascots are for fans. In the end, we either have a mascot or we don't, but the administration could acknowledge that feelings have been hurt and try to find a better solution, if there is one, to this.  We never had to forfeit games. We were told we could not host and the chief could not dance at playoff games. The first clause is the one that the university was concerned with, since the NCAA playoff games bring money in for the host University. We never had to forfeit games.

On a further note, this means that the university would miss revenue for NCAA playoff games and not the actual game? I know the university has many bills to pay, but I'm starting to see the alums train of thought.  During your calls, did anyone ever want to talk about international students?",

    "snippet" : "I was wondering if anyone leased with Shlens.  Any thoughts?  Thanks    I had a lease with them a few years back when the husband was still around. They're not bad, but we weren't the type of tenants who ever really asked for anything. The apartments are kind of lower-end, we couldn't run the microwave at the same time as the A/C or the breaker would flip. We also had a problem with running through light-bulbs very quickly --just a terrible electrical system. We got most of our security deposit back (they made us pay for cleaning the oven, which is understandable). I wouldn't be worried that the woman's running the business by herself now, the husband rarely did anything in the first place. Just out of curiosity, which building were you in?     Currently with her now. A semester into my lease and so far I have nothing to really complain about. If anything, we regret getting an apartment with a tv included in it. At this point, you can get a better tv for the same cost and it will be yours after the lease is up. The locations she offers are pretty hard to beat for the price. \n\nAs for the comment about the bike sticker thing, I haven't needed one at all. \n\nEdit:\n\nWas reading comments below, she is quite strict with no candles and no space heaters. So far, I haven't had any huge issues with the electrical system at all (The only thing being that the bathroom fan takes a few seconds to turn on sometimes.) Found it a little that she wanted the first month's rent a month after signing, then waited a few months to cash it, but if that's my biggest complaint... not bad at all. She charged you extra for the TV? For us, it was \"the rent is the same regardless, if there's a TV in the unit, then you get a TV.\"  Ended up with a unit with both a TV and ceiling fans.  No, she's not good. She takes forever to get anything done whether it be cashing in your rent checks, sending back your deposit, giving you a bike sticker to park your bike in the bike stands, fixing heat. My friend lived with her last year and went without heat for the whole winter and had exposed wires from his heater the whole time too. \nAvoid Shlens like the plague &gt; My friend lived with her last year and went without heat for the whole winter\n\nYeah, I'm calling bullshit.  She's really slow at fixing things. Obscenely slow. Something has been broke in my apartment from the previous tenant. When we were looking at the apartment the tenants reminded her then and she didn't do anything. My current roommate reminded her and nothing. What is \"something\"?  An aesthetic fix could be forgivable (scratched/chipped/etc furniture), but if its a non-essential appliance (like a dishwasher), this would be a dealbreaker to me.",
