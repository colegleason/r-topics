I see more injuries in football than I do in boxing. In football you have people paid to professionally monitor it all. With Boxing it may be that the school feels that if someone sustains(just one person) a serious injury......the school would be blamed.  The University is not affiliated with any RSO's on campus. If someone were to get injured during boxing the head of the RSO and its board members would be held accountable. All you have to do is make the members sign a contract saying that the RSO will not be held accountable and the the participants accepts all risks. Same thing I had to do in high school for boxing. Though while they have legal distance, anything done by their students on school property still comes back to them. Though there probably still is more to it though.

An older alum (graduated in the 70s) told me that there used to be an extremely active film society on campus. At some point a couple decades later, the film society ceased to exist. I am quite disappointed by this fact, as I love getting together with others to screen films and talk about them afterward.

I can't be the only person on this campus who adores all kinds of cinema form classics to Japanese to Eastern European to Experimental film.\n\nWe do have IFV (Illini Film and Video), but they are geared toward making films and videos - not film study and appreciation.\n\nEdit: According to [University Archives](http://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=2157), the former Film Society existed form 1955 to 1996, with involvement from Professor Steven P. Hill who passed away in 2010.\n\nAlso, there is the [Chinese Independent Film Society](https://www.facebook.com/UIUCCIFS?ref=stream), but that's a little more specific than what I am seeking. I had some friends who wanted to start a film related RSO. The University said they couldn't show movies as a RSO without essentially getting permission to exhibit the film (i.e. follow those rules that no one reads in the FBI warning). It was pretty cost prohibitive and that shut things down. I'm surprised that there is not a Film Society.

You actually just need 2, the treasurer and the president. The other 3 authorized agents are optional. \"Step 3- Add your organization roster by providing the names of the president, treasurer, and three Authorized Agents.  You must have 5 members that fulfill those positions\"\n\nBut I have found there wording confusing here and there.  I'm an officer in a RSO and last year we only had the 2 positions officially filled. We had other officers but they weren't registered with the university.\n\nJust because it says you need 5 doesn't mean you actually need 5 :P  ",

Think back to the iPad robbery last year - they sent that video out for the same reason.  Besides, arson can be pretty serious (it might have just been a dumpster but fire spreads).\n\nLaugh about it all you want, but ANY police department (including UIPD) relies on the community around them.  While it would be wonderful if UIPD/CPD/UPD/etc. could stop and solve every crime, that's just not practical.  I realize this thread is going to be full of \"UIPD is useless hahaha what a joke\" comments, but this is a pretty good way of handling this situation - which means they're actually addressing the situation.\n\nJust my thoughts on this. But why did they wait two weeks before turning to the community for help identifying this guy?  He has probably already hit the road, especially if he knows cops are looking for him.   Yeah and if this was the summer and that dumpster was near say dried out grass and a tree........\n\n But it isn't... ",

Thanks for the fix If you mean Advantage Properties, I agree. I had zero issues in the two years I lived in one of their buildings. Their apartments have their own washer/dryer, which was really nice. Having covered parking for my car was also a bonus. Internet was included as well. How fast is the internet?

Thanks for the fix  I'm in Daniels Hall, and lived in Sherman Hall as well.  I really like Daniels, it's a pretty big room with your own bathroom. Feel free to PM me with any questions. $752 per month, yikes! That's a lot more than Goodwin-green, is the difference in cost really worth it?  I lived in Goodwin Green apartments my first year of graduate school.  They're not exactly cheap or luxurious, but very secure with good laundry facilities.  They're located right on campus, and I liked that since they are University housing, if I ever had a problem either maintenance or the graduate housing office was on top of it.

They're located right on campus, and I liked that since they are University housing, if I ever had a problem either maintenance or the graduate housing office was on top of it.   Thanks! How is Orchard South? I would not recommend Orchard South. Depending on where you live in OS, the laundry building could be 4 blocks away. If you want to live in OD, choose an apartment close to one of the two laundry buildings. If you are going to be here for a couple of years, something on-campus like Goodwin-Green, or something with one of the better landlords (Advantage, Bailey) might be a better idea with regard to ease of getting to classes, being on several bus routes, etc.\n\nHowever, if you are an international student, depending on the country you are from, Orchard Downs might be a better place to stay if you don't know anyone here or there aren't many people from your country. Orchard Downs organizes many [community events](http://www.housing.illinois.edu/~/media/Files/Publications/ApartmentNewsletters/Neighbor-February2013.ashx), so you get to know other people who live there, and you wouldn't feel too isolated or lonely.  Jesus, what a bunch of unsubstantiated crap. Do you have any relevant PERSNONAL EXPERIENCE with any of this? Or are you just flapping your jaw because you like attention from some freshman to be who can't distingush between crap and actual information. Just wondering what your problem is.

Or are you just flapping your jaw because you like attention from some freshman to be who can't distingush between crap and actual information. Just wondering what your problem is.  I live at Indigo Place/The Place at 117. I've lived here for a year and a half, and will be living here for another year and a half. I have not had any issues with management, they have remodeled all of the common areas in the past year (New workout room/equipment, new clubhouse, revamped pool area, repaired hottub, repaved and resurfaced the parking, and got a pimpin new shuttle, which will be running extended hours starting in the fall).\n\nMany of my friends from law school moved to The Village at Colbert Park, but that property is literally adjacent to the train tracks. It may or may not be nicer in terms of the rental units, but it is also more expensive and gets a nasty rumble every few minutes from passing freight. How much is it for a room at Indigo Place? Looks highend.... I think its between 300-500 ish per room, depending on the number of rooms. I have a 3 bedroom to myself (with my wife) for about 1100 a month. This works out to less than 400/room. Oh, ok. Not as expensive as I thought it would be. The reviews I've seen online are a mixed bag, some people are really pleased with the place, others loathe it. I guess the bad reviews are from before the renovations....   [deleted]  Look in Champaign - housing is generally cheaper and you'll deal with fewer undergraduate shenanigans. Faron Properties, Wampler, Royce &amp; Brinkmeyer - google them, look at places online, give them a call. As a student, the bus is free, but you can easily walk too - you can be less than a mile from campus, in places and closer to other grad students. It's a whole different world from Campustown or Urbana.  ",

    "snippet" : "So I was working on the 4th floor ews lab of grainger, and two lab guys came around and used a thermal imaging gun to check all the keyboards for key-loggers. They said it was in response to the \"ECE Hacker\". Just thought it was interesting and nice that they're preemptively trying to prevent such things.    Hey, I was one of those guys! \n\nYes, we're checking all the keyboards (and I mean fucking all of them) just to double triple check that there are no more keyloggers in any of our keyboards. We're then putting sweet tamper proof stickers on all of them so we know in the future if they've been opened up. \n\nSomeone said it below, but I'll just confirm what he said so you all know. The thermal gun is used because we're checking for imbedded keyloggers. When you look at a keyboard, you'll see a hotspot at the keyboard controller (as /u/NegatedVoid said, all electronics produce heat when operating). We're looking for another obvious hotspot which would be a keylogger.  How did you get that job?\n He works engineering IT. I do too.\n\nYou can find the application online if you want. haha Yup, and then being promoted to Special Operations!  I got this promotion, but I can't fit a spec-ops shift into my schedule.\n\nI guess I'll never be as cool as cooluke....

Kinda of cool but hella expensive, haha. \n\nEdit: \n\nWe borrowed it from one of the engineering departments. No way does Engineering IT have that much expendable cash xD Sure you do. Just don't upgrade your servers for 3 years. Bam! $15k to blow on hookers and a infrared gun. :-P\n\nNo, but really: I bet the F&amp;S guys have them really nice ones too so they can find leaks in the steam lines.\n\nAdditionally, couldn't you find likely targets via the additional current required? If it's putting off detectable amounts of heat, it's gotta bump the power consumption out of spec. mA required is passed over the USB bus IIRC.  What? How do they use thermal imaging to check for keyloggers? We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating. I have a hard time imagining someone opening up all those keyboards and splicing in keyloggers, but I suppose someone has to check. I'd be more concerned with someone planting a device on the ethernet cable, between the computers and the outlet.\n\nAlso surprised that the keyloggers would generate enough heat, relative to room temperature, to be seen through the keyboard. That's exactly how his keyloggers worked. He opened up a keyboard and then soldered in the keylogger to the controller. It generates heat because its an electronic device, hooked up to power. Oh, and the thermal gun we're using is extremely sensitive. \n\nThe other device you speak of I think is a lot more obvious to find and know about (from the server side). I think from our end we would know if a device like that was hooked up to a computer's ethernet jack.   How you found any more of this dudes key loggers? Also I was at one of the computers while you took a pic of the keyboard. That gun was pretty cool That's exactly how his keyloggers worked.

How many of these things did he manage to plant? I have a hard time imagining someone opening up all those keyboards and splicing in keyloggers, but I suppose someone has to check. I'd be more concerned with someone planting a device on the ethernet cable, between the computers and the outlet.\n\nAlso surprised that the keyloggers would generate enough heat, relative to room temperature, to be seen through the keyboard. We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating. This seems like such inefficient and probably ineffective way to check for hardware keyloggers. All electronics give off a little heat. They'd be able to see an unusual heat source inside the keyboard (remember, they probably own a buhzillion of the same keyboards).\n\nI think it'd be much less efficient to actually go around opening them all up. As another poster said, now they're putting tamper-proof stickers on them so they won't have to image again. Huh. I didn't know there was such a thing as a keylogger inside of a keyboard. That wouldn't help against something [like this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Keylogger-hardware-PS2-example-connected.jpg/175px-Keylogger-hardware-PS2-example-connected.jpg) though. Right, but they can simply order EWS staff to check for them on a regular basis. Perhaps they already do.\n\nThe tamper proof stickers would have to be checked, too. This seems like such inefficient and probably ineffective way to check for hardware keyloggers. We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating.  ATTENTION. Please Upvote this so people can SEE.\n\nI know these guys probably checked this as well, but whenever you use the computers PLEASE make sure to check the back of the computers to where the keyboard connects to see if there is an attached keylogger. There are many hardware keyloggers that people plug into the USB port and then plug the keyboard into that.\n\nSO if you think anything is weird with how the keyboard is connected....DON'T USE IT  So who is this ECE hacker? Sorry I guess I haven't been keeping up with uiuc news. I know there was some ece hacker like 2 months ago. Is it the same guy? Yep, same guy. Same guy who cancelled that ECE class last semester, glued a professor's/administrator's door shut, and put keyloggers in a bunch of computers in Everitt. \n\nDo some searching on this sub for \"ECE Hacker\" and you'll find the threads. \n\nThe TL;DR is: Guy did stupid shit. Guy thought he was smart shit. Guy got shit on by campus security and FBI. Guy got arrested. Guy posted bail. Guy awaiting trial.  So how did he get the professor's password(s) with keyloggers in the EWS keyboards? So how did he get the professor's password(s) with keyloggers in the EWS keyboards?  So what about software sided keyloggers. It's not that hard to add yourself to the sudoers file and be able to install a daemon keylogger.

    "title" : "Greek Life at UIUC ",
    "snippet" : "Hello redditors of UIUC! \n\nI was accepted into UIUC recently and was wondering about sororities on campus. Is it beneficial to be a part of a sorority or a waste of time? From what I know about the university, it's pretty big into Greek life. Are most people on campus involved in it? Any thoughts? \n  I feel like I can help out a lot here. I'm a physics major and in a house. Seeing as my classes are mainly guys I wanted a way that I could make friends with a lot of girls. I know a lot of people will talk about how being in a house is a \"waste of time\" but its not. Most sororities will have test files where you can look at notes, quizzes, labs, exams and all sorts of helpful information from semesters before. This has helped me out a great deal with homework for whenever I seem to get stuck. The other thing that most people don't understand is that you have to hit a minimum gpa to be in a house. The girls all want you to succeed and so homework and exams will always come before sorority life. \n\nNot even just the school life, but being in a sorority is a great place for networking. I have been offered jobs and promotions from other sisters who are no longer in college. The opportunities gained from being in a house alone makes it worth it. \n\nThis university is really big on greek life, and on a campus a large as our school, being in a house will honestly make the campus feel smaller. I have made so many friends in other houses (both sorority and frat) and its nice being able to walk around campus and run into people you know. \n\nFrats and sororities are super involved in volunteering and raising money for various causes. Most people know little about this. We raised over $10,000 in a semester for our philanthropy. Not to mention we go and read to children every week as well as other supplemental things like working in soup kitchens, clothing drives, and habitat for humanity trips.\n\nNot to mention but being in a house is just fun. We do a lot of activities together like sit down hang out and watch movies, pull pranks on each other, going out, random walmart runs, getting ready for events together and so much more. We're all normal human beings, we just happen to live in a house together. \n\nThere are so many different houses on campus, 18 now and a possibility of 19 next year. There is a unique personality to each house and if its something you're interested in you're bound to fit into one of them! Worst case scenario you can always go through rush, discover that you don't like it and drop. You can even join a house and if its not what you were hoping for (don't get along with the girls, not enough time, decide its not for you, whatever) you can drop. That's the thing, as much as it is a \"commitment\" no one is forcing you do to anything you don't like. \n\nWith that being said, it is a time commitment, at first. The first year you are in the house you will be the most involved. You will have new member meetings, initiation and a lot of other things. As time goes on the house takes up less of your time. Also it is expensive to be in a house. Living in is not cheap (about the same price as the dorms) and there are also dues. But there are dues for any club you join. \n\nI love being in my house, and while I know that most redditors are anti-greek I think you need to just experience it for yourself and then decide.  This needs a counter point pretty badly because it's rather skewed.\n\nFirst of all, don't glorify the fact that greek systems are essentially access to a cheating pyramid. The fact that the university doesn't crack down on what is obviously cheating is beyond me. Frats/sororities do not hold to any standard of academic integrity at all. And the minimum GPA is not something all that hard to keep.It's not like you feel pressured to keep that GPA. What's your house's minimum GPA, out of curiosity? \n\nThe job network is rather convenient and does have obvious benefits. However, if you are smart with your connections (which I am not, sadly), you can network in a similar way you could with a fraternity or sorority. Talk to professors, take advantage of research opportunities, get involved in your department. This is a great college and the staff here are well connected in their fields.\n\nDon't start the whole philanthropic causes thing. First of all, a good portion of that money comes from alumn or people outside of the house. It is nice that greek life contributes to \"supplemental things\", but if those \"things\" are really important to you then you shouldn't need to join greek life to participate. Anyone can work in a soup kitchen or run a clothing drives. (Plus, I still firmly believe that habitat for humanity is just a way for a bunch of spoiled kids to have a morally fulfilling vacation in a town. There is nothing unemployed people in New Orleans can't to do build a house that your sorority can, sorry. If anything you're just stealing the jobs and local resources they have.)\n\nThe whole fun paragraph is nothing unique to greek life at all. I guess that was the point of typing it out, but chilling, pranking, buying shit, and pregaming are normal parts of college lifestyle for everyone. However, something not everyone has is the vindictive jealousy that goes with sorority sisters within their own house and at girls in other houses. So be wary of that.\n\nI'm not anti-greek. I have a lot of friends in top houses and I know it's a big part of life here. But I *hate* how the information they give out to draw in new members is skewed. The best piece of advice heander gave you, OP, was give it a try. See if you like it, but be aware that very few girls ever drop out of a pledge class and I don't really want to imagine how their ex-pledge sisters are to them. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Congrats on your acceptance.  I don't disagree with you iam0594. You made a lot of good points! But at the same time any time a person gives their opinion on a subject it will be skewed. I have a bias to being in a sorority because I love being in a house. \n\nI agree that the university is not on top of their game when it comes to \"cheating\" but I know of people who have access to old tests and quizzes just like I do, but instead of getting it from sisters or brothers they get information from friends. I have several GDI friends who pass around all of their information from previous semesters to their friends. How is that any different? I'm just explaining that being in a house has helped me with my school work. My house has a min. GPA of 2.6 (I think?) but some houses have a 3.0 requirement. \n\nWhen it comes to philanthropy when we raised money last semester it was from dinners, ice cream bar and a football tournament. All the money raised was from other students on campus. We weren't asking for donations from our alumni. And I never said that you had to join a house to volunteer and raise money, its just one of that added perks of being in a house. \n\nThe fun paragraph isn't unique to greek life. I completely agree with you on that one, but it is something that I love about being in my house. Any time someone wants you to join a club they're going to list out the benefits of being in a club. This is no different with me and my house. I love the volunteering aspect, I love hanging out, I love being able to go ask older girls in the house for help with school. While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek. \n\nYou are also correct, very few girls drop out once they're actually in the house. Where most girls drop out is during the actual rush experience.  &gt; While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek.\n\nRight, and I totally get and appreciate that. I'm not trying to bash you or sorority lifestyles at all. \n\nI'm pretty sure that you'd agree with me that in order for someone in a house to get access to previous tests and homeworks is much easier than it is for someone not in a house. So I guess in a way the main reason they are different is because of how readily available you have access to material you shouldn't. I know lots of people end up with stuff like that anyways and that professors usually change their material to prevent that from being an issue, but I feel like it's more implicit within a house. And not like that's necessarily a bad thing, I could use some answers for my engineering classes myself. But it is present and that's that.\n\nI'm very critical of philanthropy anyways so sorry to sound like I was attacking you on that. \n\nAnd yeah absolutely on you just listing the good sides of joining a sorority. If my sister were to come here and want to join a sorority I would likely tell her she absolutely should. I don't have broad, generalized notions anything against the people in them at all. Sorry if I came of as harsh! I was just defending why I love being in my house, but I can come off too strong to often!  Nope, you were one of the most respectable posters I've seen on here. I refuse to accept your apology.  Can I ask why we're banning Moruitelda? They had an [internet fight](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18sncm/ruiuc_where_do_you_feel_unsafe_around_campus/c8hu294). Juicy. They should fight irl. I'd watch.

It is nice that greek life contributes to \"supplemental things\", but if those \"things\" are really important to you then you shouldn't need to join greek life to participate. Anyone can work in a soup kitchen or run a clothing drives.

See if you like it, but be aware that very few girls ever drop out of a pledge class and I don't really want to imagine how their ex-pledge sisters are to them. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Congrats on your acceptance.  This needs a counter point pretty badly because it's rather skewed.\n\nFirst of all, don't glorify the fact that greek systems are essentially access to a cheating pyramid. The fact that the university doesn't crack down on what is obviously cheating is beyond me. Frats/sororities do not hold to any standard of academic integrity at all. And the minimum GPA is not something all that hard to keep.It's not like you feel pressured to keep that GPA. What's your house's minimum GPA, out of curiosity? \n\nThe job network is rather convenient and does have obvious benefits. However, if you are smart with your connections (which I am not, sadly), you can network in a similar way you could with a fraternity or sorority. Talk to professors, take advantage of research opportunities, get involved in your department.

You seem completely normal and unlike girls from what people consider to be \"top houses\". Shame my house never does anything with anyone but houses I don't like.\n\nWhen it comes to rushing both fraternities and sororities, a lot of people get turned off from it because they see how the people in the \"top houses\" act, and figure that if that's the top, then the ones beneath can't be good. But they're all wrong, because first of all, there are still plenty of great people in top houses, they just aren't seen as much.

I'm not in a sorority (dropped after the first day of recruitment, too much \"ra ra sisterhood\" for me), but one of my best friends is. Her biggest complaint to me is that her sisters get kinda catty and jealous if she hangs out with non-house members too often. I personally need lots of time alone. I don't know your personality, but it seems like theres always something you have to participate in in a sorority, which sounds like hell to me. I think that all depends on the house! My house encourages hanging out with non house members. We like being individuals, and by joining other clubs and hanging out with other friends you do just that. Just because you join a house doesn't mean that those girls have to be you're only friends.          It depends on what type of person you are. There are alpha-girl (ultra bitchy, extremely attractive) sororities and there are more average-joe girl sororities. If you can get along with these girls and want to spend a lot of your time with them, +12,000$$, go for it.\n Not sure why all the downvotes, probably just butthurt alpha-girls. Your implication is absolutely right though: more unique, interesting women that can carry stimulating conversation are probably best not conforming to Greek Life, while averagely interesting or egotistical girls will probably benefit greatly from it. The same can be said for men. It is a masturbational system at its core. It depends on what type of person you are. There are alpha-girl (ultra bitchy, extremely attractive) sororities and there are more average-joe girl sororities. If you can get along with these girls and want to spend a lot of your time with them, +12,000$$, go for it.\n I only know of one sorority that's that expensive. For the most part, they run from $3000-$6000/yr Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n  Please keep in mind that your experience with one sorority should NOT be generalized with how other sororities are like.\n\nGive it a shot, the people in my fraternity are incredibly close to me. If the fit is right, these people become your best friends. Without Greek life, I would have lost a huge part of my support system and would have stressed myself out and dropped out of college. It's so great for relieving work stress.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have just as many friends out of Greek life as I do in Greek life, but when you get to know upperclassmen and older students, you have a MASSIVE source of academically and socially experienced people. They really help you see things that you wouldn't have otherwise with your freshman friends in dorms.\n\nAnd for those wondering about the GPA argument, here is your source for GPA grade reports.\nhttp://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/ifcGrades.asp I find the lower table more interesting - the All Female Undergraduate Student GPA is higher than the All Male Undergraduate Student GPA by 0.22, which is quite a big difference IMO.  I do see that to be really interesting actually, I didn't notice that earlier. What do you think the reason for that is?\n\nI want to believe it has (in part) something to do with the gender breakdown in engineering and other liberal arts majors. Thoughts anyone?    If you've read past posts on this subject, you'll probably find that there is a bias in this subreddit against the Greek life.  \n\nLikely stemming from a systemic and deep seeded jealousy of the popular by the self-depreciative masses that occupy this forum.

Downvoted because the truth hurts. No, downvoted because the idea of being \"popular\" because you are in a frat / sorority at a university of &gt;40k students is a relatively bizarre one.  Also, the idea that non-greek people are inherently jealous of you because know other greek people is false. \n I agree. Personally, I think it's a lot cooler to make your friends based on interest/personality rather than buy them. But I'm an unpopular god damn independent person so what do I know.  You don't buy your friends when you join greek life. The money goes towards benefiting both the individual and the community. But you wouldn't know that because you probably just judge it based on the actions of a few stupid frat boys and a few catty sorority girls who don't accurately represent greek life as a whole. Well, I chose not to pursue that lifestyle. You don't think kids join that bologna to make new friends when they come to school? It's the same reason people join clubs is to meet new people but they usually don't have to shove out a couple grand for it every so often. However, yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about after being here around these people for six years, having dated someone in a frat, and being friends with people from frats and sororities. God, I'm an idiot! Get a life, me.  I didn't say its for everyone or blame you for not joining it. I didnt tell you to get a life. I was simply pointing out that you are make a rude false assumption about something you aren't apart of.

It just looks like a smaller and bit furrier yellow lab, and his name is Marley. Any information on a sighting would be appreciated, THANK YOU! \n\nedit: i have a link to a picture of him on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=102341316618243&amp;set=a.102333749952333.4943.100005271246756&amp;type=1&amp;theater  Saw him on Springfield between ~~Sixth~~ Fourth and Fifth.  Almost behind the JSM office.  He was running back and forth in that parking lot on springfield there\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI just searched the square from second and white to fifth and green and did not see any signs of him.  Based on the way he was running from fence to fence in the parking lot (between fourth and fifth on Springfield) at approximately 9:00 PM, I would guess he left the parking lot going north or west.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but I hope this gives you something to go on. Sorry I didn't stop him BTW...with no collar I didn't know where to take him (my apartment doesn't allow pets) and I wasn't sure if he had his shots to where I should be holding on to him for an extended period of time        What area was he last seen? Is he wearing collar/tags? he was last seen at 5th and green, but unfortunately he slipped out of his collar. When did this happen? earlier today, not sure the exact time.  Has he been found?     Any new news? I'm pulling for the pooch.  I hope you don't mind, I shared your picture of the dog on my Facebook.  I'm not in Champaign anymore, but I have friends who are.  I also included the phone number listed in the comments. I hope you don't mind, I shared your picture of the dog on my Facebook.  I'm not in Champaign anymore, but I have friends who are.

I haven't lived in either of those places, but my general experience is that people don't care whether you drink/smoke or not, and are certainly not going to shun you if you don't. Just have a good attitude and don't judge others for doing so, and after some time it will cease to be as big a deal as you are imagining it to be.  ",

It's not like we get to go to games for free. Couple thoughts.  First of all, I agree with you, lots of students work their asses of with extracurricular activities.  And I think the football palum who said something along the lines of 'try walking a day in our shoes' gives current and former U of I athletes a bad name.  I'm fully aware that loads of people would have gladly worked their asses off to compete for U of I.  \n\nThe difference that I think is pretty important to note in regards to working/extracurricular vs sports is the time myself and many other athletes missed in the classroom.  I regularly had to miss classes/exams for competitions, hence the reason the DIA provides us with tutors.  With that said, I also regularly attended office hours too.  As a track athlete, I knew getting a degree was more important to my future than sports. \n\nAs far as Illini Athletics, the quick source I pulled from '09 said:\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget. \n\nwhich seems to show it's not quite as shaky as you're implying, those years including some garbage on the football and bball court\n\n[source](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)  I didn't mean to imply that Illinois particularly is in bad shape, but just wanted to illustrate that a general trend in college athletics is very thin margins that disappear very fast for a lot of places. As for your link, it says Illinois was in the black for the 17th straight year at the end of 08-09, but that doesn't mesh with the N-G article I linked to which said that in 1997, the DIA was $1.3 million dollars in the red. One possibility is that under normal operations the DIA was scheduled or budgeted to run $1.3mln in the red in 97, but that passing the student fee then helped alleviate that.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that oftentimes non-athletes, like myself, overlook that athletes don't get to set their schedules the way a regular working student would so thanks for bringing that up. It's a lot easier to get a work/internship schedule around class and impossible to say, \"schedule this Big Ten conference matchup on another day please\" since athletes have no control over that.

I mean I know this school isn't known for its liberal arts, but you would think a senior majoring in Journalism would know how to write a half-decent editorial.   Pretty impressive how ignorant and self serving this article is\n\nEdit: Also impressive how out of control reaction is getting That's why I posted it... I'm friends with some people in athletics who freaked the fuck out.   Honestly, I think this all could mostly be resolved if the players were allowed to get paid like every other profession. College sports are really messed up in this way. Colleges provide special treatment to their athletes to attract and sustain good athletes because good athletes are cash cows to the universities.\n\nLet the athletes get paid, and people like this writer will see the economic worth of certain athletes. Also, then the athletes don't need to be afforded special treatment.  First students who've studied abroad and now student-athletes. Any guesses on which demographic of students will be the next target of scorn by a DI \"opinions\" columnist?  Engineering: why do they get their own computer labs and free printing? Why is their library so big and why are there so many engineering buildings?  First students who've studied abroad and now student-athletes. Any guesses on which demographic of students will be the next target of scorn by a DI \"opinions\" columnist?    The author doesn't seem to realize that the school needs these incentives to attract good athletes to the school, so the sports programs can continue to generate revenue for the school. You've been lied to my friend. You've bought into the mythos that College Athletics (a) make a profit, and (b) that profit (if it exists) is returned to the academic portion of the university. There are relatively few (think 4 or 5) universities in the nation where both (a) &amp; (b) occur. U of I is not one of those schools. \n\nWe, students/taxpayers/property owners, subsidize the costs of student athletes and collegiate athletics. It comes out of our tuition and taxes (sales/income/property). Any source for these claims?  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/story/2012-05-14/ncaa-college-athletics-finances-database/54955804/1\n\nIf you consider the subsidy, it's pretty much even. Thanks for the source, but those number still show that the athletic department made a profit. \n\n[This one states that as of '09:](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget.  Not sure what your point is.. Not yourself, but ewat85 claimed that the athletic department operates at a deficit, which is the reason I requested a source.  Your source says ewat85 is wrong.  I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem. The fact that I cannot show you a source has been the product of law review articles for decades. Because college Athletic Departments, and college athletics themselves, fall under the exempt function of each university there are very few requirements placed upon their financial accounting and reporting practices. As such, there is relatively little oversight into the expenses and revenue that the universities claim to be making and spending. The line between athletic and academic expenses is a blurry one and is being abused by most, if not all, universities in this country.\n\n\nFirst let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. It is written to give you the impression that they made a ton of money. Now, look through the PDF provided with that statement. Where, under the finances section, does it say that U of I took in more revenue then it spent? Nowhere. Why is that? Because it's a BS statement. \n\nHow can we be sure that it is bullshit? Because under the finance section the total revenue and total expenses are exactly equal, down to the dollar. Go talk to a CPA, a business owner, an auditor, a tax attorney, anyone with oversight over a budget. Ask them how often total expenditures match total expenses. Now ask them how often it happens two years in a row. The answer will be NEVER. It never happens, and it ABSOLUTELY NEVER happens when your budget is $70+ million. So how is it possible for it to happen here? I mean surely U of I can't just lie about these numbers.\n\nIn fact, they can. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a 501(c)(3) organization. It is tax exempt as both a government entity and as an education institution. The university files a form 990 every year in which they tell the IRS how much they make, how much their assets are worth, etc. etc. etc., what they don't tell them, and what they need not tell them, is how much money comes from each of their activities. It isn't required. Athletics is considered a tax exempt function and therefore is not broken down on the Form 990. The only information one receives is a single line under \"Miscellaneous Income\" that says \"Athletics Receipts.\" What does that mean? What is and is not included in \"Athletics Receipts.\" I can't find U of I's 2008 or 2009 return but in 2011-2012 U of I claimed ~ $3.5 million in athletics receipts. Lets just assume that U of I retained its perfect harmony on revenue and expenses for last year (which it will). What then is this $3.5 million in receipts? If expenses = revenue, what makes up this 3.5 million dollars? Why will this amount likely not be its own line on the DIA annual report? \n\nYour looking at this and saying \"So, what does any of this prove?\" \n\nSo... this shows you how little oversight there is. Athletics Receipts means something to the IRS but isn't a notation on the DIA expenses form. Expenses reported to the NCAA are different from expenses reported to the Department of Education, and different from expenses reported through the DIA. \n\nThere is no standardized accounting principle being employed by all the universities in the nation right now. There is no harmony between the numbers reported by the same institution to various organizations collecting data. What does this show? It shows that we have no idea what is being spent and where that money is coming from. Furthermore, there is little to no transparency within the Athletic Directors office. If U of I was doing such a great job of \"breaking even\" or \"turning a profit\" every year, one would think that they would be more than happy to release their books to the public. They don't and they won't. AD's are playing a shell game and they'll continue to do so until there is standardization, OR, until we once and for all treat college athletics like the money making enterprise it is and tax it. Until that time creative accounting will be used to hide the true costs of athletics from the people who are paying the price.\n\n\nSo, that wasn't very substantive, I know. However we can move on to a more concrete portion of my claim. If we take the USA Today table as true (which I would dispute) then you see that U of I averages ~$4 million in subsidies every year, or, $20 million from 2006 to 2011. That is money that comes from students and taxpayers. So ... that proves I'm correct at least to the extent that I claim that we, collectively, are subsidizing the Athletic Department. \n\n\nNow, I have a question for you. If U of I's athletic program gives back so much to the university, then, there should be some record of it somewhere. Why is it so hard to find that record?   I dont know, but you have my upvote - this was an incredibly well written explanation that deserves more upvotes than the athletics apologists in this thread. I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem. The fact that I cannot show you a source has been the product of law review articles for decades. Because college Athletic Departments, and college athletics themselves, fall under the exempt function of each university there are very few requirements placed upon their financial accounting and reporting practices. As such, there is relatively little oversight into the expenses and revenue that the universities claim to be making and spending. The line between athletic and academic expenses is a blurry one and is being abused by most, if not all, universities in this country.\n\n\nFirst let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. It is written to give you the impression that they made a ton of money. Now, look through the PDF provided with that statement. Where, under the finances section, does it say that U of I took in more revenue then it spent? Nowhere. Why is that? Because it's a BS statement. \n\nHow can we be sure that it is bullshit? Because under the finance section the total revenue and total expenses are exactly equal, down to the dollar. Go talk to a CPA, a business owner, an auditor, a tax attorney, anyone with oversight over a budget. Ask them how often total expenditures match total expenses. Now ask them how often it happens two years in a row. The answer will be NEVER. It never happens, and it ABSOLUTELY NEVER happens when your budget is $70+ million. So how is it possible for it to happen here? I mean surely U of I can't just lie about these numbers.\n\nIn fact, they can. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a 501(c)(3) organization. It is tax exempt as both a government entity and as an education institution. The university files a form 990 every year in which they tell the IRS how much they make, how much their assets are worth, etc. etc. etc., what they don't tell them, and what they need not tell them, is how much money comes from each of their activities. It isn't required. Athletics is considered a tax exempt function and therefore is not broken down on the Form 990. The only information one receives is a single line under \"Miscellaneous Income\" that says \"Athletics Receipts.\" What does that mean? What is and is not included in \"Athletics Receipts.\" I can't find U of I's 2008 or 2009 return but in 2011-2012 U of I claimed ~ $3.5 million in athletics receipts. Lets just assume that U of I retained its perfect harmony on revenue and expenses for last year (which it will). What then is this $3.5 million in receipts? If expenses = revenue, what makes up this 3.5 million dollars? Why will this amount likely not be its own line on the DIA annual report? \n\nYour looking at this and saying \"So, what does any of this prove?\" \n\nSo... this shows you how little oversight there is. Athletics Receipts means something to the IRS but isn't a notation on the DIA expenses form. Expenses reported to the NCAA are different from expenses reported to the Department of Education, and different from expenses reported through the DIA. \n\nThere is no standardized accounting principle being employed by all the universities in the nation right now. There is no harmony between the numbers reported by the same institution to various organizations collecting data. What does this show? It shows that we have no idea what is being spent and where that money is coming from. Furthermore, there is little to no transparency within the Athletic Directors office. If U of I was doing such a great job of \"breaking even\" or \"turning a profit\" every year, one would think that they would be more than happy to release their books to the public. They don't and they won't. AD's are playing a shell game and they'll continue to do so until there is standardization, OR, until we once and for all treat college athletics like the money making enterprise it is and tax it. Until that time creative accounting will be used to hide the true costs of athletics from the people who are paying the price.\n\n\nSo, that wasn't very substantive, I know. However we can move on to a more concrete portion of my claim. If we take the USA Today table as true (which I would dispute) then you see that U of I averages ~$4 million in subsidies every year, or, $20 million from 2006 to 2011. That is money that comes from students and taxpayers. So ... that proves I'm correct at least to the extent that I claim that we, collectively, are subsidizing the Athletic Department. \n\n\nNow, I have a question for you. If U of I's athletic program gives back so much to the university, then, there should be some record of it somewhere. Why is it so hard to find that record?   You're mostly just rambling here. This statement alone is enough nonsense to discredit everything else you said:\n\n&gt; First let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. \n\nThat's not at all what that statement claims.  That's not what 'budget' means.  Even still, you've already lost all credibility by saying the athletic department operates at a deficit when sources prove otherwise. \n\nThe DIA pays for nearly everything with it's own revenue and donations from former athletes, such as myself, and not from your tax dollars or tuition costs.  Even without the subsidy, the athletic department made a profit. \n\nWith that said, these claims are far from the arguments brought up in the initial article.  You've been lied to my friend. You've bought into the mythos that College Athletics (a) make a profit, and (b) that profit (if it exists) is returned to the academic portion of the university. There are relatively few (think 4 or 5) universities in the nation where both (a) &amp; (b) occur. U of I is not one of those schools. \n\nWe, students/taxpayers/property owners, subsidize the costs of student athletes and collegiate athletics. It comes out of our tuition and taxes (sales/income/property). I wasn't aware that was the case here; however, the athletics benefit the school in other ways you may not have thought of.  For instance, it gives the school national attention, and sells lisenced merhandise.  Both of these things attract students who in turn pay those fees and taxes.  Just having your schools name out there increases applications. Out of state students also pay way higher tuition.  I do agree with your main point that the benefit of sports programs is overhyped.\n\nTyped on my phone in case there's grammar nazis.  Is Irwin open to all students? I saw a comment on the article saying that it was....but I didn't think so. I have heard of group projects happening there and student athletes inviting everyone to work at Irwin, but that's about it. It is open to all RSOs you must reserve a time spot which is pretty competitive but still open to people who are not NCAA athletes       Another gem from the DI.... ",

    "snippet" : "Hello /r/uiuc, I'm a big time lurker and I hate to break my trend of not-posting, but over the course of the past couple months I've noticed a worsening pattern of snobbery in this sub. There is an air of superiority among all the members here. I've never seen subscribers of the same sub, let alone student of the same school, tear each other apart like this.\n\nSo essentially, this is just me reminding everyone to notch it down a little bit.  There is no reason to get all aggressive and confrontational, nor is their reason to be condescending (that's a big one) or judgmental. We're supposed to be the best college sub, but if I were an objective observer and I just wandered into a random comment section, I wouldn't think so at all. Circlejerk central or dogs devouring dissenters left and right. So keep it classy, /r/uiuc, and let's remind everyone why we're the best sub around.     What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I'm at the top of my class, and I’ve been involved in numerous leadership roles in my school, and I have over 300 college recommendations. I am trained in writing essays and I’m the top essayist in the entire US. You are nothing to me but just another anti-Intellectual. I will wipe your chances of ever being on the top of your class mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my professors and my network of college deans across the US and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your education. You’re fucking uneducated, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can ruin your chances of getting into UIUC in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in memorizing SAT words, but I have access to the entire application process of the University and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your little miserable education off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you could have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking uneducated, kiddo. haha exactly, only subtle and said through tone and downvotes. Although there are some blatant assholes, most people aren't as explicit as that. woosh OP realized it was a joke... Yeah, thank you. Good god some people make me question how they got  in here.

Isnt it snobberish to tell people how to behave on a college subreddit?  I've only been around about a month, but I think the grand majority of everyone here is pretty nice. I don't let the occasional asshole bother me -- I've seen much ruder things said in other subs.   My brain suffering from chronic lack of caffeine told me the title read \"snot in the sub\" and I came in looking to find out whether it was Jimmy Johns, Silver mine, subway, or the penn station. I'm relieved to learn that it was just me being stupid.  I have noticed this as well. I don't think I would enjoy meeting a large percentage of the users on here. Comments are often full of engineering snobbery, racism, or just general distain for anything that isn't fully serving the core demography of /r/uiuc, which is mostly STEM related. \n\nAlso, the negativity expressed towards the university, which all us of willingly attend, is not constructive in the least.

Apparently everyone is disagreeing with you, but I think you're right.  It's hardly a circlejerk here. I say this as someone who is far from the core demographic: female and a Social Work major. I have never felt unwelcome in this subreddit due to snobbery or other reasons. Most of the snobbery you perceive is probably intended as humor. The only troublesome aspect of this subreddit is occasional racism, since even if something is meant as a joke, it can still be hurtful and unwelcoming. Also, I wish /r/uiuc had more members who are in non-STEM related majors, but this is reddit. Undergrad in TESLand Linguistics. Gogo minority majors! Yay. There's even less people in your major than in mine! It's hardly a circlejerk here. I say this as someone who is far from the core demographic: female and a Social Work major.

Engineering is slightly harder than bashing a rival bus company and being nasty to passengers, so you might want to back off.  Examples plox? Calling the subreddit \"circlejerk central or dogs devouring dissenters left and right\" is a pretty hefty claim. Sorry, that's just me novelizing what I see, not nearly as bad as that phrase makes it. But I'm not going to single out a poster and put the blame on them. Again, it's more just mentality that slightly leaks through tone than blatant posts.  Give us examples you passive aggressive LAS pussy. /s\n\nedit: but seriously. give us some examples. wtf is LAS.   The core concept of a circlejerk and dogs devouring each other are two entirely different things...do you even know what a circlejerk is?  That's why I listed both of them. If they were the same I would just type one or the other. Fine, so I interpreted your use of \"or\"  in a way you didn't use it. Would you care to link us all to specific examples so we actually know what you are talking about?  The core concept of a circlejerk and dogs devouring each other are two entirely different things...do you even know what a circlejerk is?  http://www.reddit.com/r/uiuccirclejerk/ ohohoh   I have no clue what you're talking about.  Pretty much everyone in this sub is courteous.  Post some specific examples, or else I'll just assume you just posted this for attention. Actually, I guess the fact that I'm being accused of posting for attention immediately is proof in itself... Well when you make accusations you should have evidence.  I have no clue what you're talking about.  Pretty much everyone in this sub is courteous.  Post some specific examples, or else I'll just assume you just posted this for attention. I'd rather not post specific examples, and why would I post this for attention? This is my first post, ever. But the \"unsafe\" thread from the other day was particularly ridiculous.  You may be a little oversensitive.  I saw that post as \"Most of campus is pretty safe\", \"Unlit areas scare me\", and \"don't carry around a bunch of money\".  Not sure how that's \"snobbery\".   I doubt he is talking about that thread - the posts on that thread constitute the kind of stuff that would end up on subredditdrama. There have been posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18rkpz/why_does_it_smell_like_manure_near_isr/c8hj8pr?context=3) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18h3kg/uiuc_sees_decline_in_asian_applicants_primarily/c8gr8rx?context=3), on the other hand, that are rather malicious. This is reddit.  Though those examples are bad, they are still not nearly as bad as reddit overall.  I'd say as far as reddit goes, this sub is pretty congenial.  The op didn't mention racism, or bigotry either.  For op's first post to be insulting the general user base is pretty offensive.  I'd say the vast majority of posters on this sub are pretty friendly.     You may be a little oversensitive.

    "title" : "Physics Majors",
    "snippet" : "So I'm looking to go into a physics major here at UIUC. I wanna ask all the physics undergrads and grads here: what's it like being a major in physics? and: What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? Do u feel worried that you won't find a job? Do you question your decision at times? What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?   I wasn't a student here, but I can answer some of your more general questions.\n\n&gt;What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? \n\nGrades, research experience, recommendation letters, subject GRE scores. An admissions person (at a *very* highly ranked school) told me once that they're looking for people who have at least three of those rated excellent or two outstanding.\n\n&gt;Do u feel worried that you won't find a job?\n\nNot really, but I'm not interested in a faculty position. The unemployment rate for physics PhDs is around 1%. If you're willing to sell your soul to the semiconductor or defense industries or go to the financial sector, you won't have any trouble. One of my friends who washed out of grad school (aka left with a masters) went and got a medical physics degree and is now quite happy doing medical imaging.\n\n&gt;Do you question your decision at times?\n\nI probably should have been an engineer or a chemist, but that's just me. I haven't closed any doors, but I certainly haven't been on the fastest path to get where I think I'm heading.\n\n&gt;What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?\n\nGet exposure to as many fields as you can. You never know what's going to actually strike a chord with you.  \n\nGet involved in research as soon as you can, but don't be afraid to change labs if it's a bad fit. That goes for grad school as well.  \n\nTake courses outside what's required. You never know when knowing how to write an efficient algorithm, speak a foreign language or quote classic literature is going to help you -- those are all real examples from my career so far!\n\nRelated to that: cross disciplinary work is the future for the sciences. Learn how to talk to chemists, biologists, etc. They're going to speak a very different language from you, especially in terms of mathematics. Who would you recommend a physics major too? As in, I am passionate about physics but am not sure if I have a very romanticized view of physics. What are some misconceptions that you might have had about a physics major that came up by surprise?     Senior in majoring in Engineering Physics atm. \n\nI came in with ap credit for Calc I and phys 211. I chose to take phys 211 to start where most other people did. The phys 211-214 courses weren't tough to me. I was in the first phys 225 course and enjoyed it because of the instructors that taught it at that time. I then took phys 325, and while it was tough, thoroughly enjoyed it because it was my first real physics course. Beyond this I have taken all of the regular physics curriculum (E&amp;M: 435/436, Quantum: 486/487, Stat Mech: 427, Labs: 401/403) and then some others (Thesis track: 496/499, Subatomic: 470), plus some upper astronomy courses. If you have questions on those feel free to ask. A lot of my time was working homework sets that could take anywhere from 1 to 10 hours depending on the course/professor. \n\nGraduate schools look at your GPA, GRE, PGRE (GRE physics subject test), research conducted, letters of recommendation, and personal statement. If you want to attend graduate school you should have some research done as an undergrad. This is not hard to obtain though. You can either go knocking on professors' doors or apply to external research programs such as REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates). I did both, first by asking around the department when I was a sophomore to do research over that summer. Then by applying to REUs and getting to accepted to one at the Uni of Neb-Lincoln. I did physics and astronomy education research during these projects. Besides research you'll want some strong letters of recommendation which you can obtain from professor by doing research or being a really good student in their course (going to office hours, answering questions, etc.). Basically getting them to know your name and yourself. The other credentials come down to you studying and working hard in your courses and preparing for the standardized tests if you need too. \n\nI do not feel worried that I won't find a job because I'm choosing to stay in academia, a.k.a. going to graduate school. I was worried at first that I wouldn't get into a graduate school, so I applied to 11 schools. Some were \"safety\" schools, while others were hard to reach programs. I have gotten into several schools and will make my decision later this semester. I do not regret my decision to pursue graduate school because I am passionate about research and know this is what I want to do after talking to multiple professors about staying in academia. If you're interested in doing graduate school for physics keep this in mind, most programs will fund you if you are choosing to pursue a doctorate degree (which takes about 5-7 years). They will fund you through either a teaching assistant-ship, research assistant-ship, fellowship, or scholarship. For example, for the several places I've been accepted they are offering me a full tuition wavier and a stipend for being a teaching assistant during the school year. \n\nFor advice, I would say make sure physics is something you are passionate about. If you do not know what field you are interested in, start going to colloquiums here to get an idea of what each subfield is like. Also, you can get an idea about which field you like when you take the respective courses. For advice on finding research, just start asking professors through email, or knock on their door and ask them in person.  Don't give up and keep trying. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot give advice on being in graduate school, but I'm sure others can help with that. \n\nIf you have any specific questions about the undergraduate program here, feel free to ask.  Can you tell us what schools you applied to and where you got in. Really want to gauge myself to see where im headed for grad school. If you could give us info about the critical stuff (GPA, GRE, PGRE, LoRs, Research Experience) will be super helpful. ",

    "title" : "/r/UIUC, where do you feel unsafe around campus?",
    "snippet" : "I'm living around Springfield/Gregory next year, and I feel a little unsafe walking around at night.  So, tell me, is that a safe neighborhood?  Where don't you feel safe?  Where should the average person avoid at night while carrying lots of cash?  Anywhere South of Green. Us engineers fear the outside world. Anywhere South of Green. Us engineers fear the outside world. Everything north of Green, there is no liquor north of there for biz majors. :p  I wish they would fix some of these lights. There are points where it's just pitch black.  Parts of Urbana simply don't *have* street lights. Many of the neighborhood streets off of Washington, east of Vine, for instance. They cause light pollution or some such.\n\nSeemed to me to be just a greater liability to hit a pedestrian. To be fair, if you live east of Vine, you're probably not a student here. That is a long ways away. Farthest I've seen someone live without a parking pass on campus was Vine and Florida, and he usually just skips class because of the distance.

There are points where it's just pitch black.   Okay, first strike, don't carry large amounts of cash. In addition to possibly being robbed, you can also lose it. TCF and the UIUC Credit Union have free checking accounts for students and they give you a debit card. Use them. You can cancel a lost/stolen debit card. You can't get cash back if you lose it or it is stolen. \n\nSecondly, the only place I'd feel unsafe at night is north of University or on Green St at like 4am. But don't be an idiot. Be aware of your surroundings.  Don't use a checking account to store money in a bank if safety concerns you. It's not hard for someone to mug you at an ATM and force you to withdraw $1000 in less than a minute. Instead, you want to get a savings account attached to your bank account and only store a necessary amount in the checkings account. There's no way to access the savings account at an ATM. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I used to deposit my pay checks directly to my checkings account at the local bank and a bank teller once told me that it was \"not safe\" for me to have all my money in a checkings account for this reason. Perhaps she was just trying to get me to start a savings account? I'm assuming you're right.  I don't know much about banking, but if I had to guess I'd say banks can't invest with your checking but can with savings.  That's probably why savings generate interest and most checking accounts don't. Banks can't legally invest in regular savings accounts, that's why the return on them is shit.  There is no risk in checking or savings.   In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I think they used to be much more separate than they are now. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.

There's usually a $500 daily ATM withdrawal limit on those, so no. Right, because losing $500 is something you brush off. \n\nEDIT: Sorry, I misread Perrys comment and thus misunderstood yours. You are right, carry on.  I merely refuted his statement about checking accounts and a thousand bucks. Chill out. What part of that comment made you think I'm not chill? I'm falling asleep as I type. \n This is just beyond stupid. Please go on. Ok...? Did you not start it with your comment you thought was funny? Making more friends, I see.

Springfield/Gregory in Urbana is actually pretty safe IMO. I walk past there regularly (live on Springfield/Busey) and I think that the Urbana area east of north quad is actually safer than a lot of areas in Champaign. \n\nPlaces where I don't feel safe: Anywhere north of White on the Champaign side between 1st and Wright, and the area around the six pack.\n\n\"Where should the average person avoid at night while carrying lots of cash?\"\n\nEverywhere?

I feel unsafe near 1st and healy at 3am.  I'm so confused. Aren't Springfield/Gregory parallel?  I'm so confused. Aren't Springfield/Gregory parallel?        I lived near Elm/Busey last year, and I had to walk down Western Ave (it's more an alley to be honest) at all hours of the day and night to get to lab. It's a bit sketchy I'll admit, but no one ever bothered me. I know someone was robbed earlier this year getting into a car in the parking lot at Springfield/Goodwin, but I don't think that was more chance than anything. In short, the neighborhood's alright.\n\n&gt; Where should the average person avoid at night while carrying lots of cash?\n\nEverywhere. Why would you carrying large amounts of cash at night?   Saferides are pretty awesome and free. Use them     Springfield and Gregory is quite safe.  I spent 2 years living on Springfield and Lincoln (and two years before that right over on Springfield and Green, and then one year after that just a block over on Springfield and Coler), never any issues in the area.  I'd say don't go North of University in the middle of the night and you're fine.  I feel much less safe south of Green st and West of 6th to be honest.\n\nIn general though, if you can avoid walking around alone in the middle of the night, do so.   I lived at stoughton and harvey, a block north from what you say... i never really had any problems... public safety building right there. but... keep south of university. also, who carries cash these days? There are very few crimes north of University unless you're near the student housing on Lincoln. No one's around looking for trouble since it's just a neighborhood. I walk back from downtown Champaign down Washington/Beslin/Fairview a couple times a year, and mostly it's nice old ladies out watering their flowers and some kids on bikes... It just looks super shady. Walk through the neighborhood at night alone when it gets warmer out. You won't feel safe. \n\nAnd technically you can classify every group of residences as \"just a neighborhood.\" Some neighborhoods are way worse than others. And some of these neighborhoods are right next to each other. \n\nExample: My parents live in an area where the average home is $500,000+ and there is little crime. I work 10 miles away in an area with stabbings, robberies, shootings, etc.     ",

    "snippet" : "The tasting room will be open, beginning today, with normal hours from 3pm to 10pm. \n\n 1703 Woodfield Drive\nhttp://triptychbrewing.com.\n\n\nWhat's on tap?\n\n\n\n* De Light Blonde - A light, crisp American blonde featuring a touch of citrusy hops.\n\n* Dirty Hippy - A Dark English mild, this low alcohol beer is overflowing with notes of toffee and caramel.\n\n* 70 Minus - Another low alcohol session beer featuring a strong malt backbone followed by characterful earthy and woody highlights. Finishes with a touch of smoke.\n\n* Spring in Amarillo - A red ale dominated by a fruity maltiness and finishing with a touch of citrus from the exclusive use of Amarillo hops.\n\n* Blueberry Blonde - Our Light blonde with a twist: lots of blueberry. This pink/purple ale features a sweet, blueberry aroma. Flavored with blueberry juice and a touch of blueberry concentrate for aroma.\n\n* Pale Ale - One of our many pale ale recipes, this iteration contains a mix of piney and spicy hops. While it finishes decidedly crisp and bitter, there is also a persistent maltiness for balance.\n\n* Skajaquada - \"Ska-jack-wa-dah\" is our take on a Cascadian Dark Ale. While dark, almost black in color, it lacks the roasty, acrid character usually associated with black beers and instead features copious amounts of hops giving it a firmly bitter finish.\n\n* Valentine - Demonstrating our seasonal whimsy, this chocolate cherry stout was brewed especially for our February opening. Aged on a combination of all-natural Montmorency cherry puree and cocoa nibs, this is truly a dessert beer. Served on nitrogen for a creamy, luscious finish.  I don't hit reddit often but when someone mentioned this thread in the tasting room last night, I thought I would bite.\n\nI am the head brewer at Triptych, one of the three owners, and I suppose you can ask me anything. Here are some answers to the other questions:\n\n* What is the deal with the low ABV beers?\n\nAs someone else already mentioned, ABV doesn't really correspond to flavor. Our tasting room is meant to be a place you can hang out for a while, play a game of chess/cribbage/cards/whatever, and since it is the middle of winter and a little bit off the beaten path, I thought it might be nice to have some beers that you can enjoy quite a lot of without getting hammered. I did this with mostly British styles, following the tradition of a British \"session\", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking Also, I knew a lot of our initial visitors would be our Kickstarter supporters, many of whom were friends and family that while they appreciate our dream, they aren't quite craft beer enthusiasts yet, and so I wanted to have a range that they could enjoy as well.\n\n* Perhaps super high alcohol beers take longer to brew?\n\nThe time difference is pretty negligible, the answer is pretty much the same. I wanted to encourage some social session engagement without making it impossible for people to get back home after an evening at the tasting room. When spring and summer start rolling around and it becomes biking weather, I'll put some more higher abv beers on.\n\n* Growlers\n\nFills are currently between $14-16. And until March 2nd, we're participating in a food drive so if you bring in a non-perishable canned good, we're taking a buck off a growler fill. We sell growlers but we are also happy to fill ANYONE ELSE's 64oz growler too.\n\n* Future beers\n\nI have a significant stable of beer recipes; the idea is that every couple of weeks there is something new on tap at the tasting room. Immediately coming up we have an Imperial IPA and an English Pale ale. Following that will be a number of German lagers. We also have a couple of beers aging in Buffalo Trace Bourbon barrels.\n\nI hope folks will give us a chance. I think our prices are competitive with craft offerings you find elsewhere and as someone else mentioned, we've tried to set up a space/place/brewery that is pretty much all about beer.  Why are all these beers such low ABV? 3%? That's less than bud light. Not too appealing to me.  &gt; - 3. Spring in Amarillo\n&gt; \n&gt; Red Ale, 30 IBU, 5.9% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 6. Pale Ale\n&gt;\n&gt; American Pale Ale, 47 IBU, 4.6% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 7. Skajaquada\n&gt;\n&gt; Cascadian Dark Ale, 90 IBU, 6.8% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 8. Valentine\n&gt; Cherry Chocolate Stout, 23 IBU, 6% ABV\n\nThere might be some correlation with just opening and not having super high alcohol beers. Perhaps they take longer to brew? I saw that. Still somewhat low for what they are in my opinion. Your point is definitely valid. For me, drinking a 3% ABV sounds like drinking water, especially at the cost I imagine they are charging for them.

Is anyone with me in supporting an initiative to the contrary? The campus is already carry free *for students, faculty, and staff*. They're trying to make it totally carry free, so the police can turn away people trying to bring weapons onto an unarmed campus. So, how does this get enforced?  Exactly. How much is enforcing this ridiculous addition to make it totally carry free going to cost us? The campus is already carry free *for students, faculty, and staff*.

Drinks are cheap, and there's no pretentiousness in the people or the food.  I went to Mug Shots a few times and thought it was okay, and I really like Boomerangs.  Only (possible) problem with Boomerangs is that most women usually don't want to go, because we normally end up at the Bullet.\n\nIf you've been, reviews?  Haven't been but I'm pretty sure it is the same owner at Mug Shots. If you like those types of bars you should also check out Pias, Tumble Inn, JonEB's, Hubers, The Ice House, and D.R. Diggers.

I plan on applying to the business minor next January (they only accept applications in January now, and I missed it this time around).\n\nLast I heard, it wasn't too difficult as long as you met the GPA/prerequisite class requirements.\nAre you implying it is easy or difficult for TSM majors?\n\nI've been taking BADM and ACCY classes in preparation for this, so it would be a real bummer if I wasn't able to get in.\n\n\n\nedit: I misspoke. The May application period is still active until January 2014 I was in TSM for a semester. I got rejected while I was in it. I switched back to stats/cs and was accepted. My gpa did go up but not by too much. As for the TSM major, it wasn't what I thought it'd be and it sure as hell wasn't for me.   I am good friends with 2 people who are graduating from the program this May, both of which already have solid jobs lined up with energy/ag companies. What companies, and what positions? If you dont mind me asking.  I'm currently in TSM with 2 semesters left after transferring from Ag &amp; Bio Engineering, but am not really familiar with the business minor.\n\nAs far as the major itself I am really enjoying it. You have to take some 100/200 level soils/cropsci/etc but for the most part you are able to choose from a pretty wide selection of TSM, ABE, and ACE classes. \n\nBased on this flexibility, the job prospects are strong in number and diversity. I know of seniors in my classes who have secured jobs with ADM, John Deere, Caterpillar, countless farming input sales, and other commercial construction/farming companies (as well as some random trading and accounting).

I can't stand this response. It's possible to get through any program here sleeping 12 hours a day. You just can't do anything else. If you'd actually like to push yourself and take advantage of the ridiculous tuition, *try*. It gets easier in a couple months, and you're actually doing shit. Not sure I agree.  I feel I do more than most of my peers here.  I tend to do 15 hours of all technical classes per semester, plus a 20 hour a week part time job and an EOH exhibit.  Sure I'm not really in RSO's (except a few brief ACM stints), but like I said I have a plenty active social life on top of the resume crap.  I actually get much more done sleeping 7-9 hours than I did sleeping 3.  That's not to say that I never pull the odd all-nighter when deadlines pile up, but I really think that your cognitive skills decrease with lack of sleep and though you can convince yourself you're doing more you're actually limiting academic performance and in my experience mental health (I've had some pretty intense depersonalization periods after a few months of &lt;3hrs/night). Like I said, it gets better after a couple months. And there are plenty of ways to avoid the dead end thinking that happens during severe sleep deprivation, not the least of which is doing work with classmates. I'm extremely active in a number of RSOs, while founding another. It makes it worth it. That being said, I've also been sick relatively often, and the crashes over breaks are hard.
