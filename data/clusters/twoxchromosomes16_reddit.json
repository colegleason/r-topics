The only time my boyfriend gets to see the real lingerie type stuff is when everything else is in the wash :p \nPlease tell me I'm not the only one that has this problem!  God I am so single I am so single too, but that doesn't stop me from wearing my sexy undies! I find wearing a matching set (or perhaps even more elaborate lingerie, like a garter belt and stockings under a skirt) give me a confidence boost even if I know no one will see them :) Oh man, I'm so glad I'm not the only one who wears garters and stockings for the hell of it. I have a huge thing for matching too so I try to match as often as I can.\n\nI mean, really for me, wearing sexy underwear (even if nobody will see it all day - sometimes BECAUSE nobody will see it) just makes me feel that much more amazing and confident. Totally agree!! My ex-boyfriend and all the other guys I've hooked up with have always thought it was kind of weird that no matter what the day, I was almost definitely wearing a matching set. They were like, \"Did you plan on this?!\"... And I don't! I just own like 90% sexy underwear because it's what I like, so it's what I buy. And my other 10% is for period week haha. God I am so single  I read this as \"sexist underwear\" and was very confused.  Sexist underwear? I had to giggle. Then I made 2 versions...\n\n\"New!

Nope. I only wear mine when I get around to actually shaving everything. I usually just shave up to the knee and wear what my sister refers to as \"hairy shorts.\" I have to feel totally awesome to wear nice underwear.  Ha! Hairy shorts...

    "title" : "Do most women actually enjoy receiving oral sex?",
    "snippet" : "I'm 30yrs old and every time I'm involved with someone new they are really eager to go down on me but I don't care for it at all. It's just not the way to turn me on. I was talking to a friend and she feels the same - plus always ends up with a yeast infection. I'm curious what percentage of women actually like receiving oral sex or if it was just drilled in to people's heads as the right way to pay proper attention to your ladyfriend.\n Like the efforts to train men to be better partners were a bit misguided because not everyone likes the same thing.\n\nAlso, how do you girls react to an eager advance to give you oral when it's not your cup of tea? I just find it awkward. Or I'll lie there and not be excited enough and feel bad.        I mean.... could it depend on the quality/ technique of person going down on you? (Single zero-experience virgin checking in by the way. Feel free to disregard.) I can't find the link now but I remember reading a very detailed guide to oral sex once. (AGAIN. VIRGIN.) The basic take-away was that it's actually like 90% foreplay, building tension, and like 10% actually bringing it home in the gumbo-pod. Which was why a season in the first season of Girls was super hilarious to me -- that childhood friend guy goes down on Shoshanna and is all \"no, it's great, I love giving head!\" and they go from like zero foreplay to all of a sudden he is sucking up her business and she just looks incredibly uncomfortable. Obviously that would not be pleasurable. Technique matters! JUST A THOUGHT.\n\nAlso, from talking with friends that actually have sex lives, I have a couple girlfriends who are like YES ORAL SEX ME ALL THE TIME and a couple who are pretty \"meh\" about it. So it could also just be a preference thing.   SO is all about it, I am totally meh. Have been with every partner, no matter what their technique. It's just not really a turn on for me and doesn't really stimulate me physically. But I confess to never telling partners this because when I try they think I'm lying and just not comfortable with it or they seem to get upset because they've always been told all women love it and it's some fail safe way to get a woman off. Turns out, it's not.\n\n\nGiving it is much better for me than receiving! That's my experience too.   I can't stand it, it just feels vile (and it's not like I've only had one guy try). Wet, cold, licking and sucking and just *ugh*. It's pretty much the only bedroom thing (short of heavy BDSM and ~~polyamory~~ group sex) that I will flat out refuse to partake in. If the guy sees it as a necessary part of a relationship, then I have to consider that we're not sexually compatible.  Cold? Cold? Yep, cold. It's just uncomfortable.  I asked because I didn't understand. What part of it is cold? Every part that he isn't in contact with. Probably also due to the fact that I'm so repulsed by it. I asked because I didn't understand. What part of it is cold? In my experience, the rest of my body feels extra cold and unloved during the act. I like it when he uses one hand to touch my body, but generally I still feel lonely and chilly while he's down there. I can't stand it, it just feels vile (and it's not like I've only had one guy try). Wet, cold, licking and sucking and just *ugh*. It's pretty much the only bedroom thing (short of heavy BDSM and ~~polyamory~~ group sex) that I will flat out refuse to partake in. If the guy sees it as a necessary part of a relationship, then I have to consider that we're not sexually compatible.  I have never met anyone with a cold mouth. Sometimes it gets cold if they use a lot of saliva and it's like all over the place.  I can't stand it, it just feels vile (and it's not like I've only had one guy try). Wet, cold, licking and sucking and just *ugh*. It's pretty much the only bedroom thing (short of heavy BDSM and ~~polyamory~~ group sex) that I will flat out refuse to partake in. If the guy sees it as a necessary part of a relationship, then I have to consider that we're not sexually compatible.  Just FYI, polyamory isn't a \"bedroom thing.\" It's a relationship style. I think you're thinking of group sex. Just FYI, polyamory isn't a \"bedroom thing.\" It's a relationship style. I think you're thinking of group sex.   I love receiving oral. The effort in training your man is so worth it. \nIf stimulation is difficult I'll suggest (I don't know how to put this) rubbing against his face? Gently moving yourself against their mouth to get a feel of what you like.      Very much agree, it's nice, but not necessary. I was with a guy briefly- he LIKED Australian kisses and would do it all the time. But, he had equally sloppy table manners. Though he was a great guy and undoubtedly the most successful guy I've ever even with, we didn't last long, the slurping during dinner and sex was a deal breaker.\nEDIT: words Australian kisses - HA! Never heard that! Australian Kiss: just like a French kiss, but down under ;) Very much agree, it's nice, but not necessary. I was with a guy briefly- he LIKED Australian kisses and would do it all the time. But, he had equally sloppy table manners. Though he was a great guy and undoubtedly the most successful guy I've ever even with, we didn't last long, the slurping during dinner and sex was a deal breaker.\nEDIT: words                Some people like it, some people don't. \n\nThat said... it could be that whoever has performed it upon you didn't know what they were doing. \n\nI had a boyfriend that became amazing at oral sex. He liked porn (wound up liking it too much, part of the reasons why he's an ex) and I was wandering by one night when I stopped dead and said, \"Do it like THAT. And *just* like that.\" And wow. Just fucking wow. I could get off within a few minutes whereas before I uncomfortably tried to tolerate ...whatever it was he was doing. I can't remember the name of the flick but I think it was an Andrew Blake film... a married couple that works in porn that only has sex with one another. \n\nI actively taught this technique to new lovers. Let's just say I think I improved both my life and theirs.\n\nAnother thing... some women are really insecure about their genitals. A big thing these days is plastic surgery on the labia (unreal, I'm never letting someone with a sharp object near my lady bits, let alone cut them) because women want to have more \"perfect\" appearing genitals. Not only that, but they're insecure about how it might smell, etc. ...The only thing I can say to that is let go of your insecurities! As long as you wash beforehand it's all good.  So what's the technique?               Why are there so many responses along the lines of \"oh,  if it's done right it will rock your world!\"  Seriously,  this really bugs me,  it's as if a woman's expressed dislike of it isn't valid,  because,  again,  we're told \"all women love it!\",  so it just must not have been done right or she's too frigid to enjoy it.  \n\nKnow what? I've received oral that got me off, hard,  but given the choice,  I'd just rather not receive any.  I just don't like it,  even if I do eventually orgasm. I have no problem with a guy with his head between my legs watching intently as he gets me off with hands/toys,  so it's not a embarrassment thing. I genuinely don't like it. Plain and simple as that.    ",

    "title" : "1 in 5 women have GI problems, and doctors have basically given up. Here's what I've learned.",
    "snippet" : "First, there are generally three kinds of chronic GI problems, moving from stomach to colon 1) throwing up/acid reflux 2) gas/stomach pain 3) diarrhea and/or constipation. The only thing that these share in common is that they can be greatly improved by avoiding foods that irritate your body (an \"elimination diet\"). Fortunately, there is a short list of foods that can irritate your body, and they're generally the same for everyone. \n\n* Irritating foods include: tomato and other acidic fruits, red meat, gluten (or just refined flour), dairy (or just cheese), fried foods, spices, dietary fats (not natural fats like in milk or yogurt - usually added fats), processed foods and preservatives, alcohol [please suggest more in the comments]\n* Spicy/acidic things will hurt people in category 1 the most. However healthy things can also be irritating, like raw vegetables particularly for those with category 2. If you have category 3, it's probably best to assume it's all going to hurt you. \n\nOnce you have a diet that your body can handle, you can slowly add back items on the list.\n\n\nGenerally these conditions are not curable. This post is important because your doctor cannot help you in most cases, even after the upper and lower endoscopies, the blood tests, the allergy tests - get those tests anyway in case. But there are steps to improve your quality of life, I split them up into three categories:\n\nHabits\n\n* Eating small amounts of the same food every day at regular times\n* Sleeping a lot and at regular times\n* Drinking at least two 17 oz bottles of water per day, between meals\n* Putting a footstool in front of the toilet, placing your feet on it will angle your internal organs to facilitate elimination.\n\nScientifically-backed solutions\n\n* Align probiotic (better clinical results than other probiotics, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19367213), kefir and yogurt (as other sources of probiotics http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22897430)\n* Vitamin B Complex and Magnesium (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21636013, http://www.nutritionalmagnesium.org/health/frequently-asked-questions.html#15)\n* Regular yoga, massage, getting sunlight or using a lightbox (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17149454 for yoga, http://www.massagetoday.com/mpacms/mt/article.php?id=14296 for massage, http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/578508_2 for light)\n* exercise (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21206488)\n* edit: fiber is a huge one. can't believe I left this out!\n\nComfort\n\n* Alkaseltzer\n* Castor oil on outside of tummy when needed, for massage\n* Peppermint tea, entric-coated peppermint pills (not for category 1)\n* Aromatherapy with tree oils (pine/cedar/eucalyptus) for nausea.\n* Hot water bottle\n\nI want to emphasize the importance of yoga and the hot water bottle. They're kind of buried in there but they are the simplest, most effective ways you can improve your quality of life.\n\nEdit: There a lot of negative comments on this post, mostly fretting that you won't see a doctor because you read my post. All I know is, my quality of life sucks and I did every test and my doctor hasn't improved my quality of life. This post is for people like me. I don't think healthy people understand how much our quality of life sucks, that's where all their negativity is coming from.  I'm sorry, but I have to butt in here. There are way more than three types of chronic GI issues. Your digestive tract is one long chain from your mouth to your butt hole, and each segment has specific things that can go wrong. However, because your stomach only has big nerves that cause generalized pain over large areas (vs small nerves causing pain in specific areas like fingertips or feet) and because all the parts come together to do the same job, they can have very similar symptoms. \n\nSome of the problems that happen are less serious, but some can be life threatening so its really important to see a doctor if you are having frequent stomach pains (also, clay colored, black, or otherwise weird poop). If your doc rules out the scary stuff,  then change your diet around or whatever but don't assume yogurt is going to help everything. Self diagnosing is not a good idea people THIS. I finally got diagnosed with Crohn's disease about a year and a half ago. Thankfully it was still in the treatable-with-medication stage, but because I have a really high pain tolerance and it was quite literally only in my small intestines, it was not detected at all in the colonoscopies or endoscopies I'd had since 2008. I'd been going to the doctor since 2004 for various IBS-related issues, and I have Crohn's disease folks. IBS is a very general description of lots of different stomach issues, and it could signal that there's something serious going on. \n\nPlus, doctors have basically given up? No. If that's what you believe, you need to find a new doctor. It may take a while to find the right doctor, and it may take a while to figure out what's wrong, but doctors have not given up. Trust me on this one. I have a fabulous GI in the Atlanta area; if anyone needs one I'd be happy to post her info. Holy shit, Atlanta? Care to share via PM or something. I've been having on and off SEVERE pain in my back and the symptoms lined up perfectly with it being a gall bladder issue, but my doctor ran every test in the book and all showed that everything is normal. \n\nSo he thinks it might be a GI issue, and when the pain surfaces again (it will happen every night for a month and then disappear for a few months), he wanted to send me to a specialist. I'd love to get some info.  I had very asymptomatic gall bladder pain when I was 18. The doctors thought I was \"too young\" to be having this pain and literally put me in the psych ward for a week before doing a very simple HIDA scan to monitor how well my gall bladder was working. It wasn't working.. at all. I would definitely find another doctor who can help you with this!  I had very asymptomatic gall bladder pain when I was 18.

Mine got so bad that I had to have my colon removed and get an ileostomy, and I'm trying to participate in a study that does stem cell transplants that looks hopeful. Changing my diet didn't do anything at all, though avoiding fiber helped with the pain a bit.\n\nLadies, go to a GI doctor if you have stomach/gut problems. I was so embarrassed of having blood in my stool that I ignored it for 6 months until the pain was too much to handle. I wish I had just gone when I first started getting symptoms. I also have a few awesome doctors, one in Boston and one in the DC area. The study is in Chicago and the doctor seems really good there as well. Just do your research, don't give up. Ugh, that sucks. Mine thankfully is not anywhere near bad enough to require surgery, but I have a friend who just had a few feet of his intestines removed. He was only diagnosed with Crohn's a few weeks before the surgery. Yeah I was considering surgery but wasn't quite at that point yet, but I got C. Diff when I took penicillin for strep throat and that really messed up my guts. I ended up going into septic shock and they had to take my colon out in order to save my life. But I think it would have been removed regardless, because it was definitely getting worse and worse. I tried to get a j-pouch but it failed and caused more problems, but I am hoping that this clinical trial I am going to participate in will make me able to go back to using one. Fingers crossed! Are you on TNF blockers? Cimzia was the worst, in my opinion.\n\nIsn't it overwhelming how many people had IBD? You'd think there would be more research on it with all the people affected by it.

There are way more than three types of chronic GI issues. Your digestive tract is one long chain from your mouth to your butt hole, and each segment has specific things that can go wrong. However, because your stomach only has big nerves that cause generalized pain over large areas (vs small nerves causing pain in specific areas like fingertips or feet) and because all the parts come together to do the same job, they can have very similar symptoms. \n\nSome of the problems that happen are less serious, but some can be life threatening so its really important to see a doctor if you are having frequent stomach pains (also, clay colored, black, or otherwise weird poop). If your doc rules out the scary stuff,  then change your diet around or whatever but don't assume yogurt is going to help everything. Self diagnosing is not a good idea people I agree. This sounds more like anecdotal web searched info than actually understanding how your body personally needs to be treated. The diet info is so general that I would not recommend diagnosing from that alone. Most people are pretty tolerant of foods (gluten is not bad, and is a pointless diet choice for those without legitimate gluten issues). Also, most fat in foods is naturally there (with the exception of frying) so I don't see how you can cut out foods with added fat, it either has fat or it doesn't.  I agree.

Self diagnosing is not a good idea people Self diagnosing is not a good idea, you are right.  But when the doctor walks away you have to take control of yourself.  I highly recommend that women seek medical attention for any and all unusual bodily behavior but if you are like me and you have been heavily medicated, you've been scoped out the wazoo (literally) and you've been tested for everything, including allergies and they still can't make the fire in your chest and the pukeing stop, you have to take control of your diet and try to find a way for yourself.  \n\nI think OP was just trying to be helpful in providing some at home remedies for some of the common issues.  I can attest that a change in diet and a healthy lifestyle really did help in my case.  Just because you are working hard to remove the things in your diet that are making the problem worse doesn't mean you have to stop seeing your Doctor.  If I didn't take that bloody pill she gives me twice a day every day I wouldn't be able to function.  I already have breakthrough acid all day as it is (I gotta drop this Pepsi habit), but at least I can sleep now.\n\nI guess what I am saying is, there is a middle of the road.  See your doctor, take your pills, and keep a healthy lifestyle that caters to your specific medical issues.  It doesn't have to be one or the other. If your doctor walks away, then you have a bad doctor and you need to find a new one, not follow vague dietary advice from the internet.

And if you don't, you'll take a stance of \"well you just haven't tried hard enough\" - to which I say, you don't know shit.  My experience with GI doctors is that they treated me the exact same way that they treated 10,000 other patients. There was no consideration of my individual case AT ALL. It was like, \"She has Crohn's disease. Turn to page 116 in the medical manual and follow the instructions there.\" But when I went to see a naturopath on the side, the naturopath asked me questions that no GI doctor EVER did. She wanted to know about my diet, use probiotics, how was I sleeping, was anything bothering me, etc. Medical science, according to my experience, is not interested in these things at all. It was the naturopath who diagnosed me correctly (soy intolerance, inability to digest cane sugar) and the GI doctor just wanted me to hand over all my money ($6,000 for a single treatment) for outrageously expensive drugs that would kill my immune system.

My father had very severe Crohn's disease.  I know quite well how GI issues work.  \n\nI'd like to emphasize the importance **of actually seeing a GI doctor if you have GI issues and not listening to random people on the internet**, because someone spouting off about the wonders of probiotics obviously *does not* understand how shit like Crohn's and UC work.  \n\nI'm sorry, but I don't just get to eat some overpriced yogurt and feel good.  My body has AN IMMUNE DISORDER, and no amount of hot water bottles, Pepto, and shit from Whole Foods is going to fix that.  \n\nYou know what improves my quality of life?

Another note: my mom had stomache/IBS problems for yeeaars until she went on anxiety meds. It was like a night and day difference with her. Apparently no one thought to consider a psychosomatic cause for her problems. Your mother is lucky.  That is fantastic for her.  \n\nI have been on anxiety meds and anti-depressants.  They didn't cure me.  Mostly they just gave me a huge appetite along with horrible fatigue.  It was only worth taking them when I was so depressed that worse stomach problems and horrible fatigue would be an upgrade on what I was going through already.  \n\nThat said, I do think there are some mental/emotional causes for my IBS.  Whenever I have big emotions (whether positive or negative - even happiness can make me ill, if it is strong enough), my body will most likely decide to get rid of whatever it has in it.  It is obnoxious.\n\nI love books and bookstores.  I ALWAYS get sick in bookstores, because I am just so excited to be there.  It never fails, so I prefer to shop in bookstores with nice bathrooms.

Another note: my mom had stomache/IBS problems for yeeaars until she went on anxiety meds. It was like a night and day difference with her. Apparently no one thought to consider a psychosomatic cause for her problems. Anxiety! \nAt my first place of work I had a really short-tempered boss and I was anxious of his morning phonecalls, anxious that I forgot something, anxious of everything. \nThis morning anxiety really translated to some runny shits in the morning, believe it or not. It wasn't daily, but it was often enough that I could attribute my gut wrenching to my \"gut-wrenching\" anxiety.\n\nIt never happened again after I left the place. Thank god, I was considering taking meds to relax me or something.   Another note: my mom had stomache/IBS problems for yeeaars until she went on anxiety meds.

I've had chronic GI problems for years and my doctors never \"gave up\" on me. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis (slow stomach) and a barely functioning gall bladder. Go to a doctor if you have problems. I suffered for 7-8 years before I went to a specialist. Once I went to a specialist and got my diagnosis I started getting better. I had my gall bladder removed and started on a special diet. I gained weight back and am actually now 7 months pregnant and tolerating it very well. (I've gained over 25 pounds which seems like such a freaking accomplishment to me). \n\nSome of the suggestions on this post are things that help me but its not a substitute for getting to a doctor. Plus I think you forget that there are NDs (naturopathic doctors) that will suggest a lot of what is here but do a work up for the person individually and may pick up on unnoticed symptoms.    I'm trying to figure out where it was necessary to say that \"doctors have basically given up\", I don't see any evidence for that statement. In fact your linked list of studies seems to prove otherwise.\n\nI just feel your editorializing this issue as a \"society doesn't care about you\" problem, when the body of your post seems to argue otherwise.\n\nOr are you simply trying to point out that doctors are content to prescribe something **rather** than advocate for healthy life-style changes. Which is toootally reasonable.   I've suffered from GORD (Gastro-oesophogeal reflux disease) since I was wee (like, under ten). My parents tried the elimination diet with me and all kinds of stuff but it runs in the family and the only thing that calms it is a pill I take once a day called Lanzoprazole (yay for free prescriptions!) It works wonders and is amazing, from horrific intense pain all the time to absolutely zero. Awww yeah.  Also, in women, GI problems can sometimes point to endometriosis-- worth checking out if you notice that the pain often corresponds with your cycle!   I have had 1, 2 &amp; 3 for as long as I can remember.  I guess I'm fucked, but I was already pretty sure that I was before I read this post.  Sigh.\n\nI've had all the tests - blood tests, biopsies, Upper GI, etc.  I do not have food allergies.  I don't have celiacs or anything like that.  All any doctor has been able to tell me is that I have IBS - the diagnosis you get when they can't diagnose you with anything else.  After seeing several doctors over 3 decades, IBS is the best any of them could ever come up with.    \n\nI know a lot of the foods that make me ill.  I avoid many of them when I can, but I often cannot.  In many cases, leaving out every food that makes me ill would leave me feeling very unsatisfied and I end up eating it anyway just to feel full and have some energy.  I think the main problem is that so many things make me ill that it is impossible to avoid them all.  To complicate things further, the rules are always changing.  Citrus will make me horribly ill one day and the next day it is perfectly fine, for example.  It is confusing as hell.  \n\nBasically, I just try to plan my life around when I think I'm going to get sick.  This means I stay home a lot, because I either know that I'm about to get majorly sick or I'm exhausted from being sick already.  It sucks.  It really fucking sucks.  I wish there was a cure.\n Have you considered consulting with a nutritionist to maybe help work out a meal plan that is reasonable and you can stick to even when you go out? It might be possible you have an allergy to a common food additive.  I have been tested for allergies to literally hundreds of things.  I am told that I am allergic to nothing and therefore have only food \"sensitivities.\"  \n\nThat really doesn't make sense to me, because every spring and fall I definitely get seasonal allergies and they are hell.  But, I didn't come up allergic to any pollen or even cats... and yet every time I get near a cat my nose plugs up.  I get to experience this on a daily basis, because we have cats.  \n\nI don't see the point of a nutritionist, because I know basically what would help my stomach and it simply isn't practical.  I will need to eat an extremely limited diet that is purely cooked at home.  I do what I can to eat simple things that I make myself, but it isn't possible for every meal and if I step one toe out of line I'm sick very quickly.  If I had my own personal chef or a nanny to take care of my 12-week-old, then maybe... on some days... I could get through without getting ill.  Maybe someday I will have more free time and will be able to live the dream of not getting ill at least once every damn day.  Until then, I just try to cope as best I can with the fall-out of being sensitive to almost everything and stay close to home.\n\nHonestly, unless someday I am very rich, I don't see myself ever having enough time to cook every meal at home and cook enough that I am satisfied.  I am not a great cook.  I find it awkward and difficult and most of the time I don't like what I make anyway.  I've slowly been pushing myself to cook more and more and am getting better at it, but the amount that I'm able to do at this point doesn't help all that much.  I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel any time soon.     I have been tested for allergies to literally hundreds of things.

Once she found that out and modified her diet, over half her symptoms disappeared.  Yes.  The allergist literally told me I am allergic to nothing.  I find this hard to believe, but there it is.

I definitely noticed that eating meals without grain made me feel GREAT afterwards.  I'd feel full, but more in a satisfied way, not a bloated I-can't-believe-I-ate-that-much sorta way.  After two weeks of that, I ate some pizza and immediately felt really gross, my stomach hurt right after.  \n\nI'm not saying everyone should go paleo (I don't find it's a sustainable diet, it's expensive and time-consuming), but it really got me more interested in learning what I'm putting in my body and experimenting on adding/subtracting things to make me feel better.

Ginger is also great. Grate into some tea and it will settle the tummy. \n\nOn another note, if you continue to have GI distress, and its accompanied by abdominal pain and cramping, with hot flashes, cold sweats and/or fever, or sometimes you need to sit down and let the pain pass, and you have diarrhea or constipation with or without blood and mucus, get a scope. You could have Inflammatory Bowel Disease which is way more serious than IBS, and needs treatment to prevent serious complications.       You may have just solved a mystery I've been churning at for a while. I get dizziness/nausea, acid burning in my stomach, and sinus pressure after I eat dinners at work (which are generally catered, so meat/potatos). I never thought it might actually be something relatively common. I just thought it was stress. \n\nIt never happens when I eat at home (which is usually pasta, I'm poor).\n\nMight be time to see a doc about this...after crunch -_-     Hmm...I've often considered that I might have a GI problem.  It doesn't happen EVERY day, but MOST days.  It seems to be like clockwork...about 1 hour after I've eaten a meal, I will have the sudden urge to go #2.  But it's not like, \"Hmm, I should look for a bathroom sometime within the next few minutes.\"  It's more like, \"Oh my god, I am going to shit my pants if I don't find a bathroom within the next 30 seconds!\" Hmm...I've often considered that I might have a GI problem.

I don't feel any need for it, nor do I feel any want for it. I'm quite happy going to bed and going to sleep every night. I'm not on any medication or contraceptive drugs, I have an IUD which can bother me if we use certain positions but not often.\n\nWe have sex at least twice a week, but he always initiates it, sometimes I really enjoy it other times I just go along with it because I love him and want him to be happy. We have always had different sex drives, I grew out of mine and he grew into his, but this seems so extreme and I find myself longing for the crazy teenage hormones I once had that would have me climbing the walls.\n\nWe have a bullet, (which he can often forget) and it helps, I don't like receiving oral and never have (except once a long time ago) and I often find myself thinking such mundane things during sex like such as 'damn dishes didn't get done' or 'I need to pack that tomorrow' and only every now and then finding myself enjoying the moment, I think I have a really hard time letting go and just enjoying myself.

And my home is certainly not \"broken\" because my parents put the effort into splitting their time raising me 50/50.      This Beverly woman is NUTS.

That the two people in the marriage **aren't** the best candidates for determining whether the marriage should persist?\n\nMy parents divorced after 23 years of marriage, all the while trying to make it work 'for the kids'.

Marriage counseling should most certainly be required before getting married.  We need to be PROactive about the situation, not REactive.

My kind boyfriend is taking care of as much as he can until something pops up, but that doesn't leave us any wiggle room, financially (and it leaves us plenty of wiggle room, sexually). Problem is, we are't going to be able to afford nearly enough birth control. I react badly to every hormonal birth control I've tried. It makes me absolutely insane and gives me double periods, periods every other week, or (in the case of the Depot shot), three months straight of period. Aside from being terrible on its own, I'm already anemic, so it gets me into health trouble. I'm also allergic to latex.

You can get an IUD on payment plan. It's about $30/month for 4 years, but the IUD stays in for 5 years.  \nNot sure how much you're spending on condoms, but those are on average $.50 each. So, unless you're having sex and using a condom more often than 1 time everyday, condoms are still your less expensive option.   Health departments give out free condoms and so do most local universities.  They're all latex, though. I've never seen non-latex condoms anywhere. You have to usually ask for non-latex. Because most people use latex those are not out in the open. Stopping by a university student health clinic could not hurt. Most don't ask for a student ID and at least the ones in my area area carry non latex.  You have to usually ask for non-latex. Because most people use latex those are not out in the open.

    "snippet" : "I was dating a typical skater-bro type of guy that was two years older. He worked at Zumiez, loved long boarding, had a car. Looking back, the only reason I was dating him was because he gave me attention and was \"cool\". He had a best friend who expressed that was interested in me, so without me knowing, skatebro stopped calling me to hang out so his friend could \"step in\" while I was vulnerable.\n\nI was young, naive, and heartbroken so I went with it. We almost never hung out, because neither of us could drive and we lived too far apart to walk, but his sweet texts kept me hooked. He said he loved me within a week. A month or so in, he invited me to a party at his friend's house in a sketchy part of town. I figured what the hell, it'll be nice to see this guy and get out of the house.\n\nWe get to the house, I nurse a beer the whole night, and decide I want to go home. Everyone was drunk and no one would drive me home, and god forbid I call my mother and have her pick me up while 1. sneaking out, 2. being with a boy, 3. being at a party while underage with people I don't know. I think that's where I made a huge, huge mistake. Every thing prior to this I can attribute to being young and seeking male attention, but I was too smart to not get myself out of there. I go into another room to lay down and hopefully fall asleep.\n\nD comes in, asks if I'm awake, I don't respond and pretend to be asleep. He cuddles me, which is whatever, who doesn't like cuddles. He kisses me on the cheek, then the mouth, and I begin to \"stir\". He backs off for a minute. He uses his phone to make a light and pulls my shirt down to see my breasts. He licks my nipples. I should have fucking decked him in the face right then and there, but I didn't. I was scared of what he would say to people, or beat me, or what. I just lay there and pretended to be asleep. He unbuttons my pants. I remember exactly what I was wearing, those pants had three buttons and a zipper that needed to be undone. He pulls them down and feels my vagina outside of my underwear. I was wide awake at this point, pretending to be asleep and wondering what to do. He pulls down my panties and puts his fingers into my vagina. Then he attempts oral sex. I'm still pretending. He then flips me on my back and gets on top of me and starts raping me. He was hard, and it hurt, because I was a virgin before this. He then uses his phone to take pictures. I pretended to be asleep and passed out the whole time.\n\nI eventually just fall asleep, after laying awake for what seemed like forever. I don't know if I actually fell asleep or not, of if I had just gone into some type of daze. We leave the next day.\n\nHe texts me later that night, saying \"Hey babe, did we do anything last night? I keep a condom in my wallet and it was gone today.\" I wanted to fucking scream. I might have. I don't know. I then texted back \"Well, if we did, I didn't have anything to do with it\" because he knew, he fucking knew, he didn't drink more than one or two beers. I break up with him, but say nothing about what he did.\n\nI've kept this inside and haven't actually written it out or gone through in detail what happened, but I fucking remember everything. how it felt, what I was thinking, the smell of the room, where the furniture was, what we talked about that night at the party. I just don't know why I didn't do anything about it. I told my mom a few months after, and she said it was my fault. She holds the rape over my head a lot, and likes to pull it out when she's angry at me. I still love her, but she won't change the way she feels about it.\n\nI want to write this fucker a letter, but I don't even know what to say. You ruined my life and sex for me forever. You lied about it to my face. Fuck you.\n\nedit: Formatting   Your mom sucks.\n\nThat's too big of an emotional gun for her to pull on you.  How old are you now, 19?\n\nYou need to bring it up with her sometime when she's not angry, and tell her how much it hurts your feelings when she reminds you of it.  Say, \"It's bad enough that it happened, but you keep bringing it up and hurting me all over again.\"\n\nI hate your mom a little right now. She just doesn't understand. She's never been raped, and she tells me it's because she never put herself in that situation, and was too smart. I want to tell her that it could happen to fucking anybody, and that what happened to me is no different than being pulled into a car of a random stranger while on a walk. \n\nThe thing is, she only mentions the rape when she's angry, and if I were to bring it up in a \"casual\" setting she would flip out immediately.

I want to punch your mother and your rapist, too.  I am so sorry you went through this. You need therapy, good friends, and time to heal.  &lt;3\n\nETA- sorry for my strong wording but I am so mad.  I would move heaven and earth if somebody touched my child.  To blame you is just... unspeakably WRONG.  This is really nice to hear - I have been trying to justify her reasoning since her first reaction. Well, maybe she just doesn't know how to process this, and this is her way of expressing her anger towards my rapist. Maybe she's right, if I hadn't been so stupid and put myself in that situation it wouldn't have happened. Maybe I do deserve to be shamed, because I did nothing to stop it. \n\nThere is NO reason for her to treat me this way.   That sad thing is, honey, even if you said \"Stop\" or \"No!\" and started crying your eyes out and begging and pleading ... he still may not have.  Like ryvir said, write it in a letter. Get it out. Keeping it in is poison.  I've never thought of it that way. I always thought that if I screamed when he first touched me inappropriately, all the other people at the party would come rushing in and beat the shit out of him. I could press charges because I had witnesses, and justice would be served. He would have to pay for my therapy, and I would be perfectly fine.   Write him a letter and cuss him out. Write all your anger and sadness and frustration and don't stop until there's nothing left. Then burn it. I did that and it was very therapeutic.\n\nI am very sorry it happened. It's bullshit. Absolute bullshit. Your mom should know it's bullshit but who knows what is going on in the world in her head.\n\nSomething that helped me was when I was thinking \"Well, I didn't try and stop\" or \"Well I kind of set my self up for it\" is actually saying NO outloud and thinking it. You did not bring this upon yourself. That boy was a rapist piece of shit who took advantage of a girl he thought was passed out. That is wrong, period.\n\nI don't know if you can or would be up to reporting it but I'd do it if you want/can. It's no one's business if you do or not so don't let anyone shame you for your choices.\n\nThe best thing (maybe a sick way to look at it) that came out of a similar situation with me was the ultimate realization that NO ONE will have that power over me again. NO ONE will make me feel helpless and NO ONE will get away with hurting me every again.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling. This truly was one of the first trigger posts that did trigger some fucking strong feelings for me.\n\nCongratulations on surviving. The fact you can coherently talk about this even to anonymous strangers is proof to your strength. I want to write him a message on Facebook, and let his girlfriends know as well. I want him to know the pain that he caused me, and what a true fucking monster he is, and that if he was able to do this to someone at 15, god knows what he's going to do in the future. And let the girls know as well. I want to write a message to skaterbro as well, because he helped put me in this situation as well. Maybe he knew. \n\nThe statute of limitations has run out, and even so, I'm too fucking scared to bring it into the public eye. Maybe this has to do with the reaction I got from the one person I told, but still. I do NOT want to be labeled as a girl who cried rape, by either the public or from a judge. \n\nThank you for this, also. I haven't told my boyfriend about what happened, and we've been having some sexual issues lately, and I know this is why. I might link him to this thread. Like I said, I am just too scared of being called a liar, I wouldn't be able to bear it if he thought of me as one.   You did nothing wrong. You did something that most teenagers do, with the sneaking out to a party. He had sex with you while you were trying to sleep; when he thought you were asleep. That is rape. It is not your responsibility to even have to have told him \"no.\" It was his responsibility to be a decent human being, and he failed, and you didn't.  The question of \"what if\" will haunt me for the rest of my life. I just can't stand it, I was too fucking smart to let this happen. I shouldn't have gone, or allowed myself to even be involved with this guy.  The question of \"what if\" will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I've thought about it, but I simply can't afford it right now. I like to think I'm an otherwise \"normal\" person, despite what happened. Who knows. Maybe I've suppressed it for so long that the emotional trauma has sort of...fizzled out.  There are a lot of of therapists that work on a sliding scale. Plenty of people have trouble affording counseling, but it really is important to actually deal with the traums head on instead of trying to bury it, which hardly ever works.

Does anyone else feel this way? \n\nI hope I'm articulating what I want to say... If not I'm more than happy to try to explain better. Thanks 2XC.  They shouldnt be trying to tell you how to cope with this. I work with victims of SA and DV and I hear this quite often. I just find it very wrong on many levels that largely unaffected people try to tell victims how come to terms with their experiences.\n\n They shouldnt be trying to tell you how to cope with this. I work with victims of SA and DV and I hear this quite often. I just find it very wrong on many levels that largely unaffected people try to tell victims how come to terms with their experiences.\n\n How would you recommend someone respond then? How would you recommend someone respond then? just listen.  don't give suggestions on how to cope.  everyone copes and heals differently, and what works for one won't necessarily work for another.  if someone you know is a victim and having difficulty coping (and looking for help), suggest they talk to someone who is trained to handle this. This is what I normally do when my friends go through hard times. I tell them I'm there for them, and while I may not know what to say, I sure as hell know how to listen.\n\nI wasn't sure if this was good or not though. They shouldnt be trying to tell you how to cope with this. I work with victims of SA and DV and I hear this quite often. I just find it very wrong on many levels that largely unaffected people try to tell victims how come to terms with their experiences.\n\n &gt; Fuck them for trying to tell you how to cope with this.\n\nDo you have to be so harsh?  They are just trying to help.  Not everybody is trained in how to help SA assault victims.   &gt; Fuck them for trying to tell you how to cope with this.\n\nDo you have to be so harsh?  They are just trying to help.  Not everybody is trained in how to help SA assault victims.   &gt;Do you have to be so harsh?\n\nYes. Intentions don't mean shit when they're harming people.  &gt;Do you have to be so harsh?\n\nYes. Intentions don't mean shit when they're harming people.  THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING HARMFUL.  If you snap at them like the way you suggest then they will shrink from ever helping anybody with anything.  Also, I don't really think that unhelpful advice is really that \"harmful.\"  The problem is (&amp; this happens a lot in society) by not correcting them, whether politely or not, you're saying the other person's feelings override the OP's feelings.\nLook at it this way. Some guy flirts with you at a party, offers you a drink, but you're not thirsty so politely say no. Later on, he brings you a drink, unasked for, and you apologize but explain you're just not thirsty right now. In most settings of society this makes you the bad guy now. I mean, he was just trying to help and it's just a drink so why can't you just smile and accept it?\nIt's essentially saying the other person's actions, because of their intentions, override your own no matter what. We do this as a society all the time and for victims of a crime like this, we do it the loudest. People insisting (politely or not, well intentioned or not) that they know how you should feel or act about an event in your life do NOT get to left ignorant of what they're doing. I'm not for being rude to them, but a simple \"I appreciate your concern but I need to deal with this my own way\" should suffice.\nIf the person responds with anger or \"just trying to help\" or whathaveyou, then politeness may wander away. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING HARMFUL.  If you snap at them like the way you suggest then they will shrink from ever helping anybody with anything.  Also, I don't really think that unhelpful advice is really that \"harmful.\"   Oh, I know how you feel. \"Don't dwell on the past,\" \"But family is family,\" And the WORST: \"Learn to forgive.\"\n\nYeah, fuck those comments.  Ugh. I've gotten that as well. \"He's your [family member], he loves you. I'm sure if you talk to him about it, it will make you feel better.\"\n\nUgh. Just ugh.\n\nAnd when I did get the balls to talk to him about it and tell him how badly it fucked me up, his response? \"It was x years ago. I think it's time you get over it.\" Oh, I know how you feel. \"Don't dwell on the past,\" \"But family is family,\" And the WORST: \"Learn to forgive.\"\n\nYeah, fuck those comments.  The first one is kind of true.  We are not living in the past, nor in the future, you are living now.  Actively feeling bad about the past is not really productive.  I'm not saying we should forgive or forget, just saying we should not let the past make us miserable.    For idiots like myself who would probably say this, what would you prefer? I've never been in a situation with an abuse victim but that's probably something I'd say because I don't know any better, so thanks for the warning. I'm not OP, but speaking as a survivor of childhood physical/emotional abuse and a survivor of rape about a year ago, these are the things that really help me:   \n* Just plain and simple listen. It's okay if you don't know what to say, it's okay to be shocked by this 'news'. It's also okay when you express that.  \n* Don't offer coping mechanism, rather ask about them. 'How are you dealing with all that?', even 'Are you okay?' help me not to feel helpless, it shows me I do have control.   \n* Offering a shoulder to lean on or to lend an ear when I need it: that is honestly great! I (I'm mostly speaking for myself here) find that talking things through (even for the umpteenth time) helps a lot. Having someone who's really willing to listen is reassuring, since I easily feel like I'm bothering people and should just keep my mouth shut and 'be strong' and whatnot (I know better, just not all the time).   \n* Hold me (if we are close enough for something like that and if you are comfortable with it). \n\nThings that are heartbreaking to hear:   \n* You should have walked out sooner than you did.   \n* He must have meant well.  \n* Why did you stick around for that long?   \n* And many others that I don't recall at this instance, but basically anything that puts the blame on the victim/survivor. Trust me, we blame ourselves more than you know and really don't need anything adding to that.   \n\nI'm sorry if any of this sounds harsh, I don't mean it to be. This is something that's really close to me, and I'm only trying to answer your question. Be adviced, though, that everyone is really different (but I think the not-blaming goes for all of us).   For idiots like myself who would probably say this, what would you prefer? I've never been in a situation with an abuse victim but that's probably something I'd say because I don't know any better, so thanks for the warning.  I'm sorry that you were abused as a child. It takes a lot of strength to move forward from any form of abuse. I hope that you have found your way to be healthy.\n\nThat being said, it's really hard for those of us who weren't abused to know how to respond to these situations. It's hard for us not only because we can't stand to hear that someone we love was hurt, but because it's not one of those things that is really easy to deal with. I understand that it must be hard for you to have people implicate you in your abuse. I don't know what the people who are saying this are thinking exactly, but I think they are trying to get at something different than what they may actually be saying. I think they mean that you are **strong**, and that they believe in your ability to decide how you live.\n\nAnyway, I hope that I'm getting this across right. I just mean that I think abuse makes those of us who have not been abused feel helpless, so we think that it must make you feel helpless. So we want you to remember the power you obviously have for having survived a really tough thing. I hope I'm making sense. Thank you so much for your thoughtful response! \n\n&gt;I think they mean that you are strong, and that they believe in your ability to decide how you live.\n\nI think this is exactly what they mean to say, but for me it's always come across as \"You have the ability to get over it, so why don't you?\"   Wow, people have no fucking right to tell you how to deal with your own traumas. That's the height of arrogance and insensitivity, to assume ANYTHING about your situation. \"Just let it go\" is also pretty close to erasing your OWN feelings about the situation. Fuck that noise, man. Wow, people have no fucking right to tell you how to deal with your own traumas.

Fuck that noise, man. &gt; Wow, people have no fucking right to tell you how to deal with your own traumas.\n\nWhen did \"rights\" come into play?  People are just trying to help, the best way they can.  Not everybody is a licensed therapist.  Maybe they may say the wrong thing, but they are trying to be good.   uuugh. I friggin hate this. \"you need to let go and move on\". IT's like, Excuse me, have you been through this? Do you know personally? Then shut up. There are good days and bad. Days where you don't even think about it and days when you just don't want to move because it hurts to function and everything reminds you of it. Personally, I like to be left alone. I am with you. I don't like hearing the annoying \"motivational\" bs and psychobabble. \n\nEqually annoying to me are the ones that just say \"Oh just get over it, that was YEARS ago\". Please, please to those of yo who have NOT been through something like abuse, assault etc; never ever say those words. \n\nFinally, also annoying, though slightly more forgivable is \"I understand.\" Watching lifetime movies does not make you an expert. Some people, based on statistics, DO actually understand because they've been through it themselves. But if you haven't, those words do not help. I try to avoid saying \"I understand\" to anyone dealing with anything. Because even if I've been through something similar, it does not mean I understand how it affects another individual.   Who is saying this to you? I've had so many people say this. Mostly friends and workers at a group home I lived in when I was younger. They all meant well, I just found it hurtful in a way I could never put my finger on. I've had so many people say this. Mostly friends and workers at a group home I lived in when I was younger.

I hope this doesn't come across as \"blaming the victim,\" but I think you are talking to the wrong people about it. Maybe it should be something you tell very few people.\n\nI totally agree that it's inappropriate. I suspect the people saying it have no idea how you feel. I think up until reading these responses, I didn't know why I felt it was offensive. I knew how I felt but if I couldn't put it into words how could I tell someone it's wrong? Now I feel like I have a much better understanding of why I take offense to it and therefore in the future I'll be able to articulate it. I hope this doesn't come across as \"blaming the victim,\" but I think you are talking to the wrong people about it. Maybe it should be something you tell very few people.\n\nI totally agree that it's inappropriate. I suspect the people saying it have no idea how you feel. If only... I've gotten this comment from my mother. I'm still living at home and there's a big family function coming up that I'm expected to go to and my abuser will be there too. She has repeatedly asked my therapist when we will start \"moving past this\". It's kind of odd that your therapist is talking to your mother - are you a minor?  \"I don't think that this is an appropriate thing to say to a survivor.\" Have you tried telling this to the people who have said these comments to you? Up until now I've never known why it felt inappropriate, so I never felt able to say it. I have a much greater understanding now and I'm sure next time it comes up I'll be able to articulate it. \n\nI'm really grateful to all these comments because now I know ***why*** I've felt it's inappropriate.          I will take the downvotes to say this. Some (not all, don't go there) people end up defining the rest of their lives by their victimhood. The people around them define them as a victim, they define themselves as a victim and they have little chance to truly recover. \n\nOur societal spotlight shines a light on issues labeling them life-changing or terrible, i.e. something you will never recover from (think early abortion, which is not a big deal but we have done so much handwringing over it it has become a big deal) and that becomes the approach people take, almost locking some people into a lifetime of drama and ongoing victimhood. Sometimes people on the outside do have a clear picture of what is happening and would like their loved ones to take charge instead of...not.\n\nYes, some childhood sexual abuse is more horrific than others but some people's personalities are such that it is difficult to recover even from minor abuse. I speak as both a former therapist and as a \"victim\" of several instances of relatively minor sexual abuse as a child, plus attempted rape.  What does this have to do with what she is saying? What does this have to do with what she is saying?",

    "snippet" : "I need help. I'm 25 and a mother of one. My boyfriend is a sty at home dad. Any job he gets loses us money due to childcare. I'm pregnant. 4 weeks. I'm freaking out. More so because I have always been against abortion for myself. It's all I have thought about since I found out. My mind is saying do that but it's hard to go against what I always believed for me. I don't really want advice. I want stories. Essentially, I want a small case study on those who did it and those who thought about it but didn't. Also does anyone know if there is a strong medical difference between an abortion and a miscarriage? Besides the naturalness that is.   As both a medical professional and someone who has had an abortion, please don't lie to your doctor. \n\nIn the US, you can have a medication abortion up to 7-8 weeks of pregnancy. This is what I chose to do at 6.5 weeks, not that long ago. I am 29 years old, I can't believe I made it through my teenage years and most of my twenties without this happening, but shit happens. My boyfriend and I haven't been together very long: an abortion was the right thing to do for us. \n\nYou take the first pill in the office, and they give you the second set (I think I had 4 orally disintegrating tablets) to take 24-48 hours later. The first pill makes the pregnancy detach from the uterine wall and the second set expels it. They also give you medication for pain (percocet or oxy), nausea (usually phenergan, but possibly zofran), and prophylactic antibiotics (I had doxycycline).The older the pregnancy is, the more likely you will experience cramping, nausea, and passing larger clots/bits of tissue. Most people pass the pregnancy within the first 8 hours after taking the second set of pills. For me, it was less than 2 hours, but I am notoriously sensitive to hormones. Two weeks later, I was still spotting, but all of the symptoms of pregnancy were gone. The ultrasound showed an empty uterus, and my boyfriend and I split a bottle of wine and a fancy dinner out. \n\nI had a miscarriage in my mid-twenties, and it was not as painful as the abortion, but the process itself was about the same. But don't lie to your doc: if you are afraid of being judged or embarrassed by him or her, then he or she is Doing It Wrong. \n\nTo clarify: I love children, and I would like to be a Mom someday, but not any time in the next 2-4 years. It was an emotional decision, and I was certainly a little embarrassed, but the truth is, I'm not special, and I make mistakes, just like other people. Why hold myself unforgiveable when I would tell someone else in my shoes to do exactly what I did? \n I want to thank you for your input. I'm not afraid of being judged. Again my doctor is wonderful. I don't want to be reminded of this. I want to think of it differently, change it to not my decision  [deleted] Thank you or your input. I meant the differences on the bodyong term. For clarification: this is between my boyfriend and I. If I go through it can I tell future doctors I had a miscarriage and it not mAtter?   I trust my doctor. In fact, I love him. But for me this is a humiliation. I would go to someone else for the abortion pill and would just like to fil out the form as a miscarriage.( Please don't hound me about if this is how I feel do t go through with it.)",

    "snippet" : "An old college acquaintance of mine (no longer a friend) recently spent about a year in East Africa. She went pretty much crazy over there and according to the friend of mine she was staying with for the first few months, was extremely sexually promiscuous and almost certainly entirely unsafe in that sex. We know for a fact that she slept with someone who is receiving ARV treatment for HIV, and either picked up or transmitted at least one STI. \n\nShe's back now, and six to seven months pregnant. She had an HIV test before going away, but no test for anything since as far as anyone knows and will not talk about the subject. For all we know she may have been tested, but closer friends to her have no idea either. \n\nWhat I want to know is whether there is any way to inform the health professionals in her area that she needs tests for HIV and other STIs? I don't want to shame her or scare her, but she has cut off most of her friends for trying to talk to her about her behaviour. This could harm her or her child if she insists on staying in denial, and we know for certain that she has already given someone an STI that she refuses to have checked out - she asked the guy in question to tell her what she'd given him so she could be treated! Please help if you have any experience with dealing with this sort of thing. \n\nTL:DR - pregnant acquaintance may have HIV, can we notify anyone so that she'll be tested?    As you mention this could harm her child. Quoting from WHO belowe, treatment during pregnancy and birth can lower the risk om transmission of the virus from mother to child to below 5%. Is there anyone you can get to talk to her about this? It is horrible to think that the child could risk being born HIV positive when this could be avoided...\n\n*The transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called mother-to-child transmission. In the absence of any interventions transmission rates range from 15-45%. This rate can be reduced to levels below 5% with effective interventions.* ",

    "title" : "New gyno recommends condoms as main form of birth control \"with abortion as backup.\" ",
    "snippet" : "I went to a new gyno yesterday for my yearly. I'm not currently on birth control, but have been thinking a lot about a copper IUD. I asked the doctor about non-hormonal birth control options and he asked if I had a lot of sexual partners. I said no, and he said to just stick to condoms with foam and abortion as back up, because IUDs have more side effects. I was really shocked, but am curious if IUDs are really that risky. The recommendation to use condoms with abortion as backup seemed a bit careless, but I'm not sure if that's just my own personal bias. Thoughts?\n\nUpdate: A lot of you are asking about why, specifically I would like to avoid hormones. I have an autoimmune disorder that flares up when I take hormonal birth control. When I was younger, I tried the depo shot, the patch, the nuva ring, and pills. All of which either made me have flares, made me crazy, or made me nauseated. When I asked about the copper IUD, the doctor immediately told me that he's seen a lot of complications from it and told me that I should have nothing to worry about if I just use foam and condoms with abortion as back up. I asked him about the foam, because I've heard that that kills off the flora and leads to bacterial vaginosis (I had problems with bv in the past), but he said he doesn't say how that would happen.   Seriously, find a new gyno.\n\n1.) He didn't explain the side effects in detail to you, you're asking here about them.\n\n2.) Due the risks/potential emotional trauma involved abortion shouldn't be a #1 backup method. (Similarly, due to side affects and the fact you want non-hormonal Plan-B isn't a good option for you either?)\n\n3.) He seems to have flippantly dismissed you, your concerns, and your desire for a non-hormonal birth control. This is not OK, it is his job to discuss these things in detail with you until are you comfortable. &gt; 2.)

He seems to have flippantly dismissed you, your concerns, and your desire for a non-hormonal birth control. This is not OK, it is his job to discuss these things in detail with you until are you comfortable. \"potential emotional trauma\"\n\nRed herring. \n\nMost women experience nothing but relief after an abortion; in fact the leading indicator of a woman's emotional state AFTER an abortion is her emotional state before it.  Ok, risks, trauma, cost, so many reasons; pick one. You miss the bigger point, it still shouldn't be used as a regular backup birth control. It is a potentially unnecessary and avoidable medical procedure -- it is never a good idea to be flippant with that kind of shit. No, not flippant, but realistic. It IS an available backup. \n\nThe risk is ten times less than risks associated with carrying a pregnancy to term and experiencing live birth, so again - all I am really left with is cost (again, trauma is a subjective and rare possible side effect).  The problem is that instead of considering **all** possible side effects, both physical and mental, of the procedures that OP could be faced with, he was assuming that the increased possibility of facing an abortion is not as bad for OP as the possible effects of the IUD. Emotional and mental problems are a possibility with an abortion, especially since we don't know OP's background or personal convictions and inner conflicts about abortion and children. And we aren't comparing abortion to pregnancy here; we're comparing abortion to using effective contraceptives like the Paragard.\n\nI would never suggest that emotional trauma is a common side effect of abortion, but I sincerely doubt that it is that much less common than negative side effects from a copper IUD that she should not use the birth control she wants and instead just plan on a potential abortion in the 15% chance that using condoms fails. The same goes for all the physical risks associated with abortion and with the IUD. I see your line of reasoning and to an extent agree - however, that doesn't discount the pain factor considering that a copper IUD results in heavier periods and worse cramps EVERY month, vs a one-time either minimally invasive (suction) or non-invasive (RU-486) procedure. \n\nI get your point though.  But that pain factor for IUDs will vary person to person. Someone who has always had light painless periods probably won't suffer too much, whereas someone with heavy or terrible periods should be a lot more concerned. It's just as individually varied as the mental turmoil of an abortion. There are degrees and shades of gray to each depending on where a person comes from both physically and socially. \n\nFor example, someone who believes that abortion is selfish and morally questionable may not have serious mental issues after the abortion, but they will likely have some doubts that plague them every so often. In the same vein, a woman with average periods may get an IUD and have slightly worse but still bearable periods. If they are the same woman, then which is worse for her? Who are you or I or a doctor to say? Barring any counter indications for either procedure, it should be up to the (fully informed) individual woman to decide what she's willing to risk and what she can stand.\n\nAnother woman may have very heavy painful periods and no qualms about abortion. Her choice is pretty clear. And another woman may have very light, painless periods and a history of depression, which can be worsened by abortions (or birth; it's certainly not an argument against abortion when the choices are abortion or full-term pregnancy) so the heavier, crampier periods will almost definitely be worth it for her. It's just such a spectrum of possible pain levels that each individual should be able to discuss it with their doctor and decide on the best plan for them. I see your line of reasoning and to an extent agree - however, that doesn't discount the pain factor considering that a copper IUD results in heavier periods and worse cramps EVERY month, vs a one-time either minimally invasive (suction) or non-invasive (RU-486) procedure. \n\nI get your point though.  \"potential emotional trauma\"\n\nRed herring. \n\nMost women experience nothing but relief after an abortion; in fact the leading indicator of a woman's emotional state AFTER an abortion is her emotional state before it.  She said 'potential emotional trauma' which is correct. Because there is the potential, depending on who the individual is and how they feel about it. She didn't say 'definite'. \n\nPeople shouldn't use elmtional trauma as an argument to prevent people from being able to access abortion, but it's equally bad to demand that no-one can possibly be traumatised by it. I know several people who have been.   That's ridiculous. Abortion is not a back-up; Plan B is a backup. If you want a copper IUD, find a better gynecologist that will have a proper discussion with you about your options. There's also a lot of topics on this subreddit about IUDs.

I'm not promoting casual abortion - while I'm pro-choice, I personally could never go through with an abortion. \n\nBut, OP clearly states she wants (needs?) non-hormonal birth control options.

I'd call it plan C. If the condom fails and we don't realize it then abortion is our plan.  Well, It's what I do, and for the record, I never had an abortion. I ended up using Plan B twice because the condom slipped, but that's it.\n\nLike you, I do not wish to use hormonal contraception. I've actually had the opposite problem - with a gyno  trying to convince me into taking birth control I don't want (and that would be less reliable for me personally).\n\nCopper IUD's can prolong your period, give you more menstrual cramps and heavier bleeding. It's a common side-effect and that's probably what your gyno was referencing to.\n\nSome gyno's also do not like placing IUD's in childless or young women.\n\nIn the end, it's your decision and your body. Condoms always worked for me but they ARE  less reliable than an IUD. You need to figure out if the \"abortion as backup\" is acceptable to you, even in theory.\n\nIf you do it, you also need to know you have the discipline to use the condom *every time* And to check if it hasn't slipped or torn after sex. You also need to make sure you have access to plan B if it does.\n\nHowever, if you are convinced you want the copper IUD despite the side effects, you should get a second opinion and find a doctor willing to place it. Because there is no reason for you not to have it. &gt;Condoms always worked for me but they ARE less reliable than an IUD. \n\nAnd, sex with a condom just sucks compared to the real thing.  &gt;Condoms always worked for me but they ARE less reliable than an IUD. \n\nAnd, sex with a condom just sucks compared to the real thing.

Not if you want to prevent possible STI's. I'm in a monogamous relationship, so, not a factor.  Not to be pedantic, but for the benefitit of others reading - it's only safe to give up condom use if you are in a monogamous relationship **and have both been tested for STDs.**\n\nSleeping with only one person doesn't protect you from anything if you don't know for sure that that one person doesn't have anything. And taking their word for it **isn't good enough**. No matter how much you trust someone you should remember that it is possible to contract STDs without getting symptoms so they could have caught something from someone and not know.

The most common reason for this variety to fail is that in some women without children, it can get displaced in the first four months.  (To make sure this hasn't happened, some doctors recommend a four-month follow up appointment for an ultrasound to check the positioning.)  Anecdotal data: I have never been pregnant and I have Paragard.  I love love love it.  Everything was just fine at my follow up ultrasound, and my periods/cramps were only worse than my pre-hormone periods/cramps for about four months.  After that things went back to the way they were before I went on birth control.\n\nMirena and Skyla both include hormones, which may result in your period stopping altogether and can help alleviate some common symptoms of PMS or PMDD.  I don't have a source for this (maybe someone can chime in here?), but I've read that the pill equivalent of Mirena is Seasonique.  They use the same hormones, so if you do well on one, you should do well on the other. To be honest, while I think a non-hormonal IUD could be the best option for my situation, the fact is my periods are ALREADY super-heavy and my cramps are ALREADY bad enough to cause me to miss work on the regular.  The idea of worsening either of those conditions, for any length of time, frankly makes me blanche.  (Not to get TMI, but I mean the period pain alone- I've been known to vomit and become light-headed due to the pain of my cramps.

Because if it is gonna make this crap worse on any perceptable level, I'm really ok with sticking to condoms, Plan B, and at worst abortion. Actually, I am that woman.  I went on HBC when I was 15 to ameliorate cramps, migraines, destructive mood swings, the whole lot.  I switched to Paragard to see whether my body had figured its shit out since puberty.  After a year on just Paragard, I went back on a hormonal pill because I couldn't deal with monthly migraines that made it impossible to see, much less function, and immobilizing cramps.  I kept my IUD for the no-chance-of-forgetting pregnancy prevention, but I added a pill to it (Yaz in my case) to alleviate my PMDD. Yaz made my skin amazing, but did unholy things to my psyche. I miss the good skin though.  Haha, that was Loestrin FE for me.  Unholy would be the perfect word for my personality during those three months, but my skin was awesome. Actually, I am that woman.

I kept my IUD for the no-chance-of-forgetting pregnancy prevention, but I added a pill to it (Yaz in my case) to alleviate my PMDD. Do you have migraines w/ an aura? If so, I would check with your doc to make sure it's okay to take Yaz. I have migraines w/ an aura, I can't take pills with estrogen because they increase my likelihood to have a stroke. I didn't know this for a long time, and took the pill for many years, before finding out it was dangerous! Plus the Yaz website says migraines are a common side effect.\n\nAs for an IUD, i tried to have Mirena inserted, but it was so painful I screamed and they had to stop. Good thing, though, because I found out after having the Norplant that progestin makes me bleed non-stop. Woohoo! I've been round and round and round with doctors about my migraines.  Yes, I get auras with my migraines, but being on the pill stops the migraines from happening altogether, so there's no clear way forward.  One doctor had me on a progestin-only pill for about a year and a half, but then my body must have adjusted to it because the migraines came back.  As my current doctor explained it, with no medication most women have a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting a blood clot at any given time.  Other HBCs raise that risk to about 5 in 10,000, while Yaz raises it to about 10 in 10,000.  To me, having no migraines is completely worth that increase in risk.  (I suppose I should note, after trying 3-4 different pills, Yaz was by far the best for managing my migraines--side effects treat everyone differently, thank goodness!)\n\nIt's crazy how much IUD insertion hurts!  I went into my insertion with no warning and it was literally the most painful thing I've experienced.  Augh.

What if she was an insanely devout Catholic? I do see your point, but I feel like there's a pretty big difference between saying \"Use condoms, if they fail just get an abortion\" and \"You have expressed an interest in non-hormonal BC, here are a variety of options and let's discuss the specifics of the IUD you asked about and whether condoms might be a better option for you.\"   \n\nIf someone inquires about birth control, you know that 1) they are ok with using birth control and 2) they are interested in preventing pregnancy.  You don't know anything about that person's stance on terminating an unwanted pregnancy.  Yes, abortion is always an option and women should be made aware that they have a legal right to choose it if their birth control fails.  However, recommending it as a backup so cavalierly, without discussing how to combine condoms with the withdrawal method to make them much more effective or how and when to use Plan B as a backup, seems to be crossing a line.  You may draw that line differently, but for me it would be a deal breaker.  Doctors should provide guidance based on an assessment of medical facts and information provided by the patient.  Doctors should not limit information or hinder access to various medical options because of assumptions about the patient or their own personal predispositions.\n\nEdit: Added an extraa letter. Oh of course he should have gone over the many other options in between *condoms* and *abortion*. Abortion is by default always going to be the final \"back-up\" option I suppose and doesn't necessarily need to be said, but I guess I just feel like it's ultimately a good thing that ob/gyns are bringing it up as an option, regardless of subjective moral concerns (as they are medically and practically irrelevant), in that it makes the idea of having one seem less taboo and might ease the shame/discomfort one might have in seeking it out when necessary.

Wow after seeing all these threads I consider myself lucky. I slight mentioned the iud to gyno and she promptly  grabbed brochures for Paragard and Mirena and went over them with me and their differences. I waited a year to make my decision to switch and I don't regret it.\n\nEdit: spelling Seriously! I see so many horror stories on here; I've never experienced anything like that, and I live in *Texas*. When I went to my gyno, I asked about IUDs and she asked if I'd ever been pregnant. I said no, she said, \"It might hurt a little more.\" I said that was fine, I left with some brochures, came back a month later to have Mirena put in... and that was that.  Wuss question - did it hurt?  Honestly? Yeah. It's like 3 minutes of the worst cramps I've ever had. I got a bit dizzy. The next two days were more uncomfortable than painful, but I still didn't feel much like getting off the couch. It's been two weeks, and I'll still get the occasional spasm if I've been running or when I'm about to fall asleep. \n\nI'm trusting the testimony of women who have been through all the cramping and spotting and still love their IUDs, though. I'm sure in a month or so, it will all be well worth it.  I hope so for you! \n\nNow I'm terrified lol. Might just stick with my pills :D I had about a minute of awful awful pain during the actual insertion, and then about 24 hours of bad cramps (think like a nasty period). I just took ibuprofen and naproxin regularly and used a heating pad--even managed to go back to work that day. So yeah, it's bad, but not *that* bad. And I am a HUGE wuss as well as having a medical phobia, so if I can do it, you probably can, too! A WHOLE MINUTE?? \n\nnaw for real, I'm just a wuss. I had a biopsy on the lower portion of my labia a few years ago and cried like a two-year-old seeing Santa. Survived though. \n\nGoing through two days of pain doesn't sound so bad if I don't have to take a pill every day for the next five years. Hm... Thanks for sharing your experience.  Oh believe me, I was crushing my husband's hand and close to tears the whole time. But it was worth it! I'm going on 11 months with it now, and it's amazing. No fuss, no worry. And you can ask for a drug that softens the cervix to make insertion easier--my doctor said it was super easy since I took it, though of course I couldn't tell the difference. You can also ask for anti-anxiety pills (they were offered to me, but I forgot to fill the prescription so I lost out). Dude! Don't ever forget to pick up the anti-anxiety meds, they're so multipurpose! haha... \n\nThank you for sharing, for real. I'm seriously considering.  I hope so for you! \n\nNow I'm terrified lol. Might just stick with my pills :D Aw! I didn't mean to make it too scary. It definitely hurt less than when I got my tattoo, and I'd happily go through both experiences again. \n\nThere are a lot of good discussions about IUDs on this subreddit, if you do a search. I'm sure most women (including myself) would rush to assure you that the convenience and fewer hormones are well worth the pain! Of course, if you don't have problems with the pill to begin with, that might be the best option for now.    Seriously!

Do you already have a child?  Mirena is actually advertised for women who have already had a child because of the Dalkon Shield lawsuits and the very tiny risk of infertility that comes with IUDs.  That's why some doctors are inwilling to give them to women No, I've never had a child. In my post, I mentioned that I informed my doctor that I had never been pregnant, and she was fine with it. She did suggest other options she thought I might not be aware of, but respected my final decision. \n\nInfertility related to IUDs was really only a problem in the 70s. The problem now, with childless women, is that insertion past the cervix is more difficult and painful. But as long as you don't mind an extra minute or two of serious cramping... it isn't much different.  &gt;Infertility related to IUDs was really only a problem in the 70s.\n\nIt is a far, far, far less likely outcome, not an impossible one.  Giving Mirena to a woman who has never had a child is technically off label.  I think doctors are obliged to give the facts in a non-judgmental way and offer a referral if they're not willing to give Mirena to a childless woman, but they're not obliged to do it themselves Do you already have a child?  Mirena is actually advertised for women who have already had a child because of the Dalkon Shield lawsuits and the very tiny risk of infertility that comes with IUDs.  That's why some doctors are inwilling to give them to women My doctor said the reason that nulliparous women have a harder time getting an IUD is because the insertion is more difficult if you have never had children, not because there's a risk of infertility. I go to a very large network POS for my healthcare (Kaiser, for anyone who's interested) and in my area (I live in a large city) there were only TWO people who would do an insertion on a nulliparous woman, so I had to wait two months for my appointment.\n\nNot that there isn't any risk at all, (as with any medical procedure or device), but from my personal experience, I believe it's because of the insertion difficulty, plus some lingering fear of the problematic IUDs of the past.

Just said there are a lot of complications and that condoms are a much better way to go.   You should find a new doctor... I would. To offer abortion as back up birth control shows a complete disregard for a women's emotional well being. I'm a pro-choice woman, but I would never casually say, \"oh, just have an abortion if you get pregnant, don't worry about better birth control.\" Damn. \n\nI don't have an IUD, but I know two women who do. The first friend of mine to get it had some complications with the placement of it. Apparently it moved (fell out kind of?) and she had to go to her doctor to have it corrected. It wasn't a terribly comfortable experience. My sister-in-law had one placed and she hasn't had any major complications from it, but her body took a few months to adjust to it. She had severe breast tenderness, to the point that wearing a bra hurt, but she said that having the IUD made the pain worth it because she absolutely does not want to get pregnant. She still gets her period sporadically too which she said is annoying, but manageable.\n\nI've seen threads about IUDs and I think what it comes down to is how your body handles birth control in general. If the pill causes bad side effects, something like an may be no better and could be worse. If you've never had a bad reaction to BC than an IUD may be a good option. They also have a non-hormonal IUD out there (the name escapes me). \n\nGet a second opinion from another doctor. IUDs are becoming more and more popular, so obviously they aren't horrible, they just effect women differently. You definitely need a doctor who cares though. I agree this guy was careless with his recommendations to you. There is no proven negative emotional side effect with abortion. Just to clarify. \n\nI do believe however that it's irresponsible to jump straight to that when there are other options beforehand. I fully support the OP's choice regardless, but I think it's much less expensive to spring for the Plan B if needed. Much easier to access too now, esp if you live in Mississippi, Wyoming, or ND.

Also planned parenthood is where I got mine and everyone there was super informed and made me feel good about my decision.  How long have you had it? My periods were bad for the first seven or eight months, and my doctor said that it would probably take around six months to a year to even out. They did even out, and now I am almost back to how I was before I used any BC (not as light as when I was using hormonal BC, of course, but it's definitely not bad).\n\nObviously I can only speak for my own experience, but I think saying they \"WILL BE TERRIBLE\" is a bit of an overstatement. My doctor told me that if I already have bad periods that they will only get worse. I didn't believe her, and she was totally right. It took about a year and a half for me to be able to not have to double up and wear a tampon and pad. I once had to go to the hospital because I was bleeding though ~2 super tampons and a pad per hour. My periods are now to where I can tolerate them with pain medicine, but before it was so bad that I would just want to sleep all day and not move. This is just my personal experience, of course. I was just trying to convey to OP that if she already has problems the copper IUD could exacerbate them. \n  Go ahead and mentally translate this as \"I don't know how to insert an IUD, and I'm not interested in learning.\"  Your Dr. has not kept up with current research if he thinks that IUDs are high risk. Further reading: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/us-doctors-iud-idUSBRE82Q17J20120327\n\nWhen searching for a new GYN, don't be afraid to ask if they are IUD-friendly before even making an appointment. This guy is a hack, and I wouldn't trust him to do an IUD properly, even if you could convince him.           Thats awful! I have a paragard and went through a similar thing trying to get one.  I had a gyno that didnt want to give me one because i had never had children so i went to another one.  I have had it in for almost 2 years with no problems whatsoever.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Did having it placed hurt? I typically am very sensitive when they do my pap, a lot of pain around my cervix. That's the only thing that I've been nervous about with getting one put in. Did having it placed hurt? I typically am very sensitive when they do my pap, a lot of pain around my cervix. That's the only thing that I've been nervous about with getting one put in.        My friend got a horrible infection from her IUD and was really sick for a while. I don't recommend them that's really, really rare and IMO, isn't a reason to dismiss them off the bat.      I've only used female doctors and they wouldn't ever say something like this. As crazy as it sounds, it seems his gender is getting in the way. \"just have an abortion no big deal\". I'm not sexist but I don't think you would hear that from a female doctor \n \"I'm not sexist but I don't think you would hear that from a female doctor \"\n\nWhy not?  If you really want a copper IUD, I'm sure he will oblige. \n\nI don't find anything necessarily wrong about what he said other than the fact that it sounds like he overly casually said 'and you can always just get an abortion anyway'. But it shouldn't be the OP's responsibility to cajole and pressure the doctor until he \"obliges\" by giving her the IUD.  \n\nOn the contrary, it's the doctor's responsibility to provide accurate, comprehensive information about the risks, benefits, and costs of various birth control options.  This doctor did not do that. Specifics weren't mentioned in post, but unless I am misunderstanding OP, she did say that the doctor informed her that there are risks with the IUD. I would imagine that he probably said what these were.  OP said \"I [...] am curious if IUDs are really that risky\", which led me to believe that he did not give her sufficient information for her to feel informed - such as the chances of her developing specific side effects.\n\nIt also sounds like the doctor did not go over the *benefits* of the IUD. He didn't say one way or another. Just that he's seen complications and that I'd be safer to stick with condoms + foam, and abortion if necessary. What's weird is that he asked if I had multiple sex partners before he answered me. Because I said no, that was his response. If you really want a copper IUD, I'm sure he will oblige. \n\nI don't find anything necessarily wrong about what he said other than the fact that it sounds like he overly casually said 'and you can always just get an abortion anyway'.

I was also dissuaded from the IUD by my doctor. She knows I want to have kids and is worried about the side effects of scarring with the IUD. Your gyno's advice is sound. She's not expecting you to go out and use it as an excuse to have 10 abortions. I have a sensitivity to condoms and foams. We use the rhythm method and have never looked back.  The chances if becoming infertile from a intrauterine device are really, really small especially with the smaller devices now used, compared to first-generation IUD'S.\n\nThe rhythm method really isn't safe at all, especially if your periods are not completely regular.\n\nWith that method you REALLY have to be willing to either have an abortion, or to have an unwanted child.\n\nAlso, it makes no sense as you're generally most horny during your fertile days.

She's not expecting you to go out and use it as an excuse to have 10 abortions. I have a sensitivity to condoms and foams. We use the rhythm method and have never looked back.  Do you use the calendar-based method or a symptoms-based method like Billings?  Also, do you feel like your libido is highest during the days you can't have sex, and is this an issue?  I've never met anyone using this method but I've been curious about it (not for me though, I have an IUD). Both. I mark everything down on a calendar, but I'm also aware of breast selling, discharge changes and pain signals such as ovulation.\n\nGood use of the rhythm method can put effacy at 99%. The problem with it is most people say they are using rhythm or \"pull out\" don't bother to really educate themselves on ask the details, which then lowers the effectiveness rates. What about issues with libido?   ",

    "snippet" : "Not really sure how to begin here because for all of the struggles with relationships I've had in the past...my sex life has never posed a problem. I've never made a self post asking for advice either; looks like first times are becoming a theme!\n\nI'm 27 and have been dating a 35 year old guy since August. We met while I was working as a waitress at a fancy restaurant (he was the chef). Our relationship has never been particularly romantic, more of a regular hookup situation that turned into more. After he was unfairly fired from said restaurant right after Thanksgiving, he was in a really bad place. Most of his \"friends\" from work stopped calling and he was really depressed. Also, because of a DWI (his second), he is not allowed to drive and was dependent on me for a ride pretty much anywhere. Because I cared about him, I tried to boost his self esteem and generally tried to take his mind off things. \n\nFast forward to now, and he has gotten another chef job at a new happening spot in town, which is great. Only now, it seems like now that he doesn't need me for all of his support, things are waning. We have had sex twice since the beginning of January, and one of those times he was so drunk he fell asleep while still inside me. Which, I think understandably, made me feel both insulted and disgusted.\n\nI don't think he is cheating on me, but the lack of physical and emotional intimacy is totally wearing on me. We used to fuck like rabbits, but now nothing. He has gone down on me ONCE, and refuses to do so even though I do it for him and despite the fact that I have asked numerous times, explaining to him that I, like many women, cannot get off just from intercourse, no matter how big the D. Like, I can't even get him to play with/touch/fondle me while I get myself there.\n\nAs I'm typing this I realize I sound kind of pathetic; I know I would probably advise someone with a similar story to drop him like a hot rock and move on. I am for the most part a smart, take no bullshit kind of girl. But it's complicated by the fact that I do care about him, and he and my roommates are good friends- one of them will be starting work as his sous chef soon. I have tried telling him that I need more affection, that I need to hear how he feels about me, to no avail. I've gained weight in the last few months (grad school induced stress eating) that I'm trying to take off, but I was a curvy girl before, and he himself is not a small man.\n\nI don't feel like it would be fair or make me happy to just drop him without giving \"the talk\" a good ole college try. But I have no idea how to broach the subject. I don't want to insult his manhood, but how do you tell a guy you've been sleeping with for months that he has never brought you to climax without insulting him? (For the record, I never faked it, I always told him that I needed more stimulation than sex to get me there, so it's not like I've been lying the whole time.)\n\nI'm feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to just drop him because I do have genuine affection for him, but I can't go on like this. I'm also concerned about a potential breakup because his last one sent him into a tailspin. He already drinks too much as it is, his last breakup was when he got his most recent DUI. So here I am, feeling fat, unsexy, unloved, and totally stuck.\n\nHelp!       ",

    "title" : "[BBC News] How safe do women feel on a night out? (Interesting perspectives from different countries)",
    "snippet" : "  The safest I've ever felt out alone at night was when I was living in Taiwan or Japan, but especially Taiwan. I lived in an area with lots of food vendors open all night and I was the only foreigner around, so shopkeepers tended to recognize me and keep an eye out too. Only once did a couple creepy looking older men try following me down a street, but the little old noodle vendor lady came out of her shop and started yelling at them. After they ran off she brought me inside, still fairly drunk, and gave my some noodles and fussed over me while I ate. After that I made sure to only visit her shop for food, but it was amazing how safe I felt in that community.  I had a similar experience in Korea! An old drunk guy asked me if I was \"Russian,\" which is Korean slang for a foreign prostitute, and the lady who ran the food cart a block outside my apartment started yelling at him. My Korean wasn't good enough to catch all of it, but she told him I was a respectable teacher, and what if I told Americans that this is how Koreans behave. He was so embarrassed he actually bowed really low to the cart vendor (not to me, heh) and hustled back into his bar, I think to hide.   The safest I felt out alone at night was when I got lost in the middle of old Shanghai.  I can't grasp the concept of how safe I felt in a city so heavily populated.          I have never felt afraid on a night out (living in Australia). That's just me- most women I know wouldn't take public transport or walk alone or whatever, but I don't know if it was an illusion of invulnerability or not.\n\nOn the other hand, when I was 12, I liked to wear massively concealing clothing because of the comments (\"show us your tits\" \"you wanna get into *my* truck?) which I've never gotten since being an adult. Somehow I got a lot of those same comments from 12-15, and then they tapered off also. I rarely get them now that I'm in my early 20's. Maybe it has to do projecting confidence?   I feel so unsafe that I almost never go out. I don't sit all locked up in my house, but I hate the bar scene and there is not chance I will never so much as sit at the bar of a chilis alone.  What about your area makes you feel so unsafe?  it's not my area. it's my gender. being female and young looking makes me a target. I have always felt unsafe as well.  I don't frequent bars at all (don't like the loud music and atmosphere and I don't drink much).  My advice to you is to enroll in Krav Maga or some other Reality Based Self Defense (RBSD) courses.  I don't want to be trapped in my house or afraid to travel and you never know where you might run into trouble (a friend of mine was yanked into a van at a grocery store.  She fought back and got away).  Trade fear for knowledge of how to disable an opponent long enough to get away and go for help!! Thanks. I was actually thinking of checking that out in May (i'm in school and the time/energy just isnt there for me right now..even though i agree its important to be able to defend onesself.) I have several styles under my belt and I never let it make me cocky.  I'm always aware of my surroundings and know that any male attacker is going to be stronger than me.  I started off with traditional karate but realized that wasn't going to do it.  Krav Maga is a lot of fun and based on natural movements and reactions.  It's great for women and kids!  There are other styles though, that are really good too.  I think more women should take their personal safety more seriously.  We seem to kind of hope that someone else will be the target or some guy will come to our rescue.  It's kind of like being in a big school of fish when a shark comes around.  Fuck that.  I had some shit happen when I was younger and I have been learning ever since then.  Hope you find a good school ! it's not my area. it's my gender. being female and young looking makes me a target. That seems a little dramatic to never go out just because you are a female. If your area isn't unsafe, then you shouldn't have much to worry about compared to some of these women. I am a woman and I fear for my safety *at times*, but don't let life pass you by *because* you are a woman... That just doesn't make sense to me. I never said I didn't go out..I just don't frequent bars or places with bars. i've had one too many encounters to wish to deal with that again. It's really not fun being cornered by someone who is completely drunk, 3X your age, and has at least 50 lbs on you. That makes much more sense. And I'm not trying to correct you, but your fear to go out to bars does kind of stem from your \"area\", if being cornered at bars by men is something that is a constant worry for you. Please don't blame it specifically on your gender, being a woman can be fun and liberating, too. And I'm sorry for calling you dramatic, as someone who decided I am a sexist woman pointed out, I don't know your story. I am sorry men have you made you feel scared for your safety. I have been there, and it sucks. *hugs* nothing but love. :) That seems a little dramatic to never go out just because you are a female. If your area isn't unsafe, then you shouldn't have much to worry about compared to some of these women. I am a woman and I fear for my safety *at times*, but don't let life pass you by *because* you are a woman... That just doesn't make sense to me. Please don't tell her how to feel because it \"doesn't make sense\" to you.  Your opinions have literally nothing to do with how it really is for her.  It's awfully rude, and a little sexist, of you to basically assume that she is \"being dramatic\" because she is afraid of male violence. Well, the way she explained it didn't give any type of male violence example, so how was I to know she was cornered by a large man at a bar? She simply said because she is female, she is scared to go out to bars. I think women should feel empowered to be women and proud of their gender, but I do understand that if someone has had a scary encounter, they wouldn't want to go to establishments. I shouldn't have used the term \"dramatic\", but I was saying it because she is a woman. I am woman, and I hate to be called dramatic so /r/txgirl09 I apologize for calling you dramatic.  Please don't tell her how to feel because it \"doesn't make sense\" to you.  Your opinions have literally nothing to do with how it really is for her.  It's awfully rude, and a little sexist, of you to basically assume that she is \"being dramatic\" because she is afraid of male violence. Agreed, and people wonder why I am hesitant to be around black people alone. Get called racist and other insulting shit...um it's just taking realistic precaution and I shouldn't be judged for it lol now I feel awkward since I do find that perception to be based off of hundreds of years of propaganda that implied black men were out to steal white women, and is inherently racist?  particularly since, according to stats from 1994, the majority of rapes happen within the same race (79% of white women were raped by white men, 84% of black women raped by black men), and out of all reported rapes, white men made up 50% of perpetrators while black men were ~30%, Mixed Race ~15% and other races not specified.\n\nso tbh white men are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more likely to hurt you. lol now I feel awkward since I do find that perception to be based off of hundreds of years of propaganda that implied black men were out to steal white women, and is inherently racist?  particularly since, according to stats from 1994, the majority of rapes happen within the same race (79% of white women were raped by white men, 84% of black women raped by black men), and out of all reported rapes, white men made up 50% of perpetrators while black men were ~30%, Mixed Race ~15% and other races not specified.\n\nso tbh white men are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more likely to hurt you. Um, please don't tell me how to feel because it doesn't make sense to you. It's rude, and I'm afraid of black violence.  This is why I carry a knife. When you walk anywhere alone, safe or not, regardless of gender, it's a good idea. All people can run into threats to their well being. Muggings, random acts of violence, rape, it happens. Better safe than sorry. I agree with you.  I'd suggest something to supplement the knife, like a spray or a firearm, but otherwise I agree.    ",

    "title" : "My 10 year old sister wants to shave",
    "snippet" : "This is more of a vent than anything. I just got off the phone with my mother who asked me when I started shaving. She then explained that my 10 year old sister, who hasn't hit puberty yet, and is probably a few years away from it, is ashamed and embarrassed of her leg hair as it's dark. She won't wear shorts because of it, and it makes me want to cry that she doesn't like her body at such a young age. I don't know if anyone in her class has said anything, or if this is because my mother and I shave, or if it's just what she's seen from television (she's an avid watcher of Teen Nick). I wish I could be there more often to help her out, but I'm away at my university for the majority of the time, and my mother isn't always one for being body positive (though her obsession is with dieting). I guess that's really it, though if anyone has any advice for dealing with this as a big sister, I'd really appreciate it.\n\n**edit**: I get it, we should help her do whatever feels comfortable with. And I'm all for that. My main concern is that she has expressed being uncomfortable with something that's natural for her age. She has explicitly said \nshe's embarrassed of her legs. \n\n**edit 2**: I realize I was overreacting a bit. I guess I'm just scared she'll develop self-esteem issues like I had, and I don't want her to hate her body like I always did.   I don't think it's necessarily a terrible thing or means that she hates her body.  I have always had a lot of self-confidence, but when I was 12 or 13 I heard some people at school joking about someone else with leg hair and I shaved my legs that night just so that I wouldn't be made fun of.  I also just liked the idea of being \"grown up.\"  Would it have been better to have defended my right to have my legs however I wanted, hair or not? Maybe, but for me it was not a big deal, I liked the way my smooth legs felt, and now at 22 I mostly shave my legs but I don't feel gross without doing so and I have confidence in general about my body and abilities.  I think it's always good to let your sister know she is beautiful the way she is and that there's no pressure to shave her legs, but if she wants to do so, she should be able to.   Yeah, this is pretty normal. I was 10 when I started shaving and I really didn't hit puberty until I was 12. Hell, I still have light colored leg hair. It's not bad to let her do it. Telling her she can't make such innocuous decisions about her own body seems a lot worse to me than letting her shave if she wants to.

Are you going to tell her she has to love her body as it is now and then when she's 13 throw all that out the window?\n\nEDIT to answer your edit: \n\nI think you're putting too much weight on this. I'm sure she knows that body hair is a natural thing, that doesn't mean she has to like it. When she gets pimples are you going to freak out if she want to put a little make up on? She's going to have insecurities about her body especially at her age THAT is what's normal. When she gets older she can be a rockin feminist who doesn't shave her legs if she wants but for right now she's 10, she wants to feel better about herself, so let her.   I started shaving my legs around that age.\nNothing wrong with it at all. You also say she hasn't hit puberty yet, but a lot of girls start puberty as young as 8 so perhaps guess again.         When I was in middle school I wanted to shave my legs, and my parents made me feel bad about wanting to shave them at my age like you want to do to your sister. Guess what? I never asked them anything so personal ever again. \n\nSo when my 10-year-old daughter told me that she wanted to shave her legs, I went right to the store and bought that girl her own razor and told her how to do it!\n\n               ",

    "snippet" : "Sorry if this is a stupid question or has been asked and answered already.  If it has, please link me to the post because I failed at searching for it!\n\nBirth control... it's supposed to be free now, right?  Why did mine more than triple in price since January 1, 2013?  It *is* FDA approved and it *is* the generic version.  I call my insurance company to ask about it and the woman says something about there being a list of the free ones on their website.  That's about all the information she had for me.  I'm not sure what list of free medications she was talking about.  All I found was one listing what Tier specific medications were in and I'm fairly certain Tier 1 does not = free.\n\nAnyway... maybe someone can throw me a link or some sort of further explanation on this?  Everything I've read and been able to understand has basically said that it's free except that insurance companies still reserve some ability to charge some for name brand medications if there is a generic available for it.  ... from what I understand.\n\n**EDIT** Forgot to add that it is a new insurance plan.  So I shouldn't be \"grandfathered\" into anything.  According to [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/politics-policy-issues/affordable-care-act-39966.htm), your insurance has the right to limit it to certain specific generics/methods.  Call your insurance provider to find out which types are eligible. I did call them earlier today and they were fairly unhelpful.  All they told me was that \"there is a list on our website of the medications\" covered under that.  I asked how to find it on the website and she basically just said, it's there, there's a link to it, it's easy to find.  Well, it wasn't.  My medication is a pill, and a generic of a fairly common birth control. I did call them earlier today and they were fairly unhelpful.

My medication is a pill, and a generic of a fairly common birth control.  I still pay for mine, only because I looked up information about it, and the new rules apply to new or renewed insurance plans since the free birth control and other stuff passed. So if your plan is from before the official start date then you still fall under the old rules. That's all I know, and I could potentially be wrong, I'm not an expert and I'm still under my father's insurance.    My insurance likes to make me pay huge co-pays at the start of each year until I've met a \"minimum\" and \"qualify\" for the insurance price. Might be that.\n\nOtherwise sounds like you're just on the wrong brand.\n\nAlso I didn't know that it had to be new insurance plans?! That explains EVERYTHING. Anyone know how to get an old plan to work like a new one? I'm sick of paying.

My SO has seen me lying on the bathroom floor after puking up my intestines with food poisoning, he can cope with a bit of underarm hair.

    "snippet" : "Hi TwoX,\n\n\nThis is a throwaway. I'm 26.  I've had five boyfriends, and I've only been in love once, with the second. To this day, I think he was perfect. With every boyfriend I try and fail to love, I become increasingly convinced that Boyfriend #2 was the only person I will ever love romantically. It's been five years, TwoX.\n\n\nPlease convince me you don't really get \"One True Love\". Dating just seems so pointless when I feel like I will never find anybody like him (and I have tried). And I miss him. For the record, we broke up because of distance and religion.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\"Juliet\"  You've built contestant number 2 into a god in your mind, the perfect man who no other man will ever live up to.  I've got news for you.  If number 2 was so awesome, you wouldn't have split up.  The truth is, he had his flaws, just like every other human.  He left wet towels on the bed, and sniff tested socks before wearing them for another day.  You just don't think of that when you think of him.\n\nYou are self sabotaging.  If every guy gets measured against someone they have no way of living up to, they will never live up to him.  Of course they don't know you like he did, he didn't when you first started dating.  Just date and let the relationships evolve. The only real issue we had was that he wanted me to convert to Judaism, and I couldn't, because it would have been a lie. Which, yes, is a major issue and it's worth ending the relationship over. But it was nothing really intrinsic to him, it was just unfortunate how it worked out. Even while we were dating, I thought he was perfect. I really don't know how to think of him in any other way. I mean, yeah, he's not a perfect person. But as a boyfriend, he was ideal.\n\nAnd, with other guys. I have almost loved them, which is why I dated them. I thought, you know, this guy I will love. It wasn't comparing him to my ex that was a problem, it was that there were things about them I didn't like. And it always ended up feeling like settling, so I ended things.\n\nI really appreciate your response. That's not a small flaw, that's wanting you to change (or pretend to change) you belief system for him.  That's pretty major.  A \"perfect\" boyfriend doesn't expect you to do that.\n\nJust give it time and space.  You're 26, you're a long way from being an old maid, have fun, live life, don't put so much pressure on yourself. The only real issue we had was that he wanted me to convert to Judaism, and I couldn't, because it would have been a lie. Which, yes, is a major issue and it's worth ending the relationship over.

And it always ended up feeling like settling, so I ended things.\n\nI really appreciate your response.  :( Tough sitch. Maybe you never got over boyfriend #2 because you *didn't* break up because of feelings -- it was distance and religion, two things that obviously affect a relationship but don't necessarily have to do with the actual emotions involved that keep you together. So if you still had those feelings for him and THEN had to break up with him, it makes sense those feelings will linger, even years after. \n\nAnd you definitely don't get \"ONE TRUE LOVE &lt;3\". It's just not logical! Out of the billions of people out there, somehow you are only destined for one? And if you mess up, don't meet them, meet them or break up.... that's it? You're over? No love? OF COURSE NOT. Life is never that simple. You will find someone else, and just because boyfriends 3, 4, and 5 didn't work out doesn't mean that ones in the future will not. You will fall in love again.  Hey!\n\nThank you so much for your response. I am feeling a bit sorry for myself today, and this really helped.\n\nIn terms of what you said, yes! That was exactly the problem, that nothing about him ever changed, and I never started seeing him differently. I just eventually accepted that we would not find a compromise over his religion, and that it couldn't work.\n\nYour second paragraph does make sense, and I think of myself as a logical person. But it's just kind of hard to believe after I have tried so many times, with, really, decent, lovely, intelligent, interesting guys. Who I just can't love. :( I know it's a natural instinct, but try not to be so hard on yourself! You're not required to love people, even if they are decent and lovely and wonderful. Accept that love is strange and strikes at random times. \n\nOut of curiosity, what was his religion? (I only ask because I'm from Utah originally, and there is a lot of tension surrounding Mormons dating non-Mormons.)   My second boyfriend was also \"The One\" to me. That was 7 years ago, and I'm now 26 and very happily starting to fall for \"The One\" that I'm dating now. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that there are lots of \"Ones\" out there, and then if we're going by the notion of soulmates then we have to consider whether your soulmate is a) alive right now, b) present on this planet, c) of appropriate age to you, d) located in a country you will visit before you die, e) etc etc etc etc., so statistically if soulmates exist then the chances of meeting them are so infinitely small then we could never have hope of finding them. \n\nChin up, carry on!

    "title" : "Are there any facebook-savvy 2Xer's out there who can help me? Someone I thought was a friend has shared some mortifying pictures of me on my timeline and theirs, and I don't know what I can do. [Trigger warning?]",
    "snippet" : "I'm totally distraught, and using a throwaway account. It all started last year at a bachelorette party. At this party there were male strippers, and I didn't want to be involved whatsoever. I was fairly intoxicated, and when the strippers came into the room I picked a seat off to the side so as not to be singled out for any attention from them. In hindsight, I should have left, but my thinking at the time was that I would just pick the most inaccesible seat left and I'd not have to worry about anything.\n\nIt didn't turn out that way. One of the strippers, despite my protests, sat on my lap, grabbed my arm and pulled me forward, and forced my hand onto his penis and moved it up and down so I was sort of rubbing him. It sent me right back to when I was sexually assaulted in my early teens, in a similar but more serious and prolonged way, when a friend of a friend sat on me to pin me down, and assaulted me. I screamed and the stripper got up, and went to someone else. I had absolutely no idea how I was supposed to react. My drunk-brain was telling that if I made a fuss I'd be ruining the party for everyone else, and it's the only bachelorette party this woman is going to have, so what sort of horrible person would kick up a stink and spoil things, blah blah. I laughed it off, but I was deeply uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend (or I thought she was), lent over and told me she had taken a picture, and it was just so *hilarious* that I had to see it. She showed me on her camera, and asked if she could send it to me later. I said I guessed that she could, but I wasn't too keen on other people seeing it. I meant to talk to her later in private about deleting the photo, but after the party was over she decided to go clubbing with some other women there, and we left in separate cars. I woke up with a killer hangover, and just never could find a way to bring up the picture, as I really didn't even want to talk about it.\n\nSo I'd basically forgotten that she had this picture, until I sign onto facebook the other day. She had put the picture on her timeline, tagged me in it, and put it on my timeline. I don't use facebook often, so these pictures had been sitting there for ages before I noticed them. My friends and family have now potentially seen these pictures. I untagged myself right away, but the damage is done now. She has a plethora of facebook friends, many of which are mutual friends, who are still able to see the photo on her page.\n\nI asked her to remove the photos and she flat out refused, becoming hostile quickly. She says that she has a \"policy\" that all photos she takes must go on facebook, and another \"policy\" of never removing photos unless there is a good reason. I told her that I was worried about friends and family seeing this, and as I'm unemployed and desperately looking for a job, I was worried that potential employers might find it. She said that's just not a good enough reason. She said the picture doesn't offend her, so it doesn't matter if I'm offended, and if a potential employer is offended by the picture I shouldn't want to work for them anyway. I put some political articles on my facebook sometimes, and she said that my political views might drive away an employer, so I have no right to complain about what she's done! Then she had the gall to tell me that if I didn't want the photo up, I shouldn't have been *posing* with the stripper. I didn't fucking pose with him, he forced my hand onto his genitals! Anyway I think it's up to me to decide what I'm willing to show an employer on facebook, not her.\n\nSeeing as she's completely ruled out removing the photos herself, I've reported them to facebook, but facebook says I can't have photos removed just because I find them \"unflattering\". Without context, the photo doesn't clearly show that I'm not consenting to what's happening, it just looks like I'm being sat on by a naked man. What other action can I take? Is there another option in facebook I don't know about for having photos of yourself removed when they're on someone else's page? Any sort of line I can call or complaint service I can email? This photo has now been up for ages, friends of mine, and members of my partner's family have \"liked\" it. I feel like pulling my hair out!! Any help at all would be truly appreciated.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**UPDATE**: I spoke with a lawyer today. She said that what my friend has done is defamation, as she was recklessly indifferent to the consequences sharing this picture would have for my reputation. Also, as I have screenshots showing that people who work for a company I was soon to be working for had seen and liked the picture, and this company have now failed to contact me as we'd arranged, there's evidence that her actions actually have fucked up a potential job for me. My options are to hire a private lawyer to take her to civil court and force her to remove the pictures and issue an apology, or I can call the police and try to have her prosecuted for criminal defamation, which would involve a fine, and (unlikely) jail time. Also, I go have grounds to force facebook to take the picture down, but as they are bathing in money and I can barely afford bus tickets, it's completely unrealistic. \n\nOutside of suing or calling the police, I could try to get her to attend a mediation session, but so far she's been completely resistant to any compromise.\n\nI don't want to involve the police, and I don't want to screw her over, so my intention is to speak with her tonight and to tell her that what she's done is actually illegal, and ask her again to remove the photos, or come to some sort of mediation session with me. If that fails I'll write it all in a strongly worded letter and see where I go from there. I'll keep reporting the picture to facebook, and keep leaving explanations in the feedback section when they reject my reports.\n\nI'd like to really thank everyone for being so kind to me here. It's really helped to have somewhere to vent, and to get some good ideas about how to contact facebook and what to say. I'm really glad to have you all *hugs*  It also might be handy to change your settings so you can preview any photos, tags, comments etc. before they are published on your wall. Whoever uploaded it will still have it on their wall, but your friends won't see it on your wall unless you share mutual friends. It great when people write/have photos that you don't want family to see because it's not sitting up there for days if you don't log in.\n\n As for this one, I'm not sure if there is much more you could do about the current photo. I guess it might be possible to message facebook again and explain that this photo was taking without your permission, the other person will not remove it and that you classify that as harassment. It's worth a try at any rate.\n\nHopefully things work out for you &lt;3 Thanks for the support. I'm going to have a friend help me change my settings tomorrow morning so that this doesn't happen again.\n\nFacebook have responded a few minutes ago, saying that the photos aren't harassment, so they're staying up :-(\n Maybe tell facebook about the assault? They're not going to tell anyone.\n\nAlso, if the man is naked, I'm pretty sure that's against their policies. I can't believe they wont take it down, it's disgusting. =/ Fortunately/unfortunately the picture stops above his waist. It's pretty clear that he's not wearing anything, but you also can't see any part of his body that facebook considers porn. It also means that you can't see that he's actually got my hand in a vice-grip, it just looks as if I'm reaching around to grab his penis.\n\nHow would I go about telling facebook this? When I reported the photo there was no option to include any comments. Is there a place I can go on the site to write something to them? Could you tell FB that you are being sexually assaulted in the photo? Because that's what it is, you were being forced into sexual contact against your will... I would keep pestering Facebook about it. This isn't just an \"unflattering\" photo. I have. They're yet to responde to that. They responded within a few hours to tell me that they weren't removing my photo, but it's been about 12 hours since I sent feedback telling them what was going on. No response whatsoever. I'm feeling really fed up with them. After a day with no reply, message them again. Fortunately/unfortunately the picture stops above his waist.

If people choose that option, it is very easy to just send an automated response saying \"we don't remove pictures, just because you don't think it flatters you\", most problems solved.\n\nAlso, think how messy that would be if they did remove every picture someone reported. Spiteful people could go through reporting hundreds of pictures on those grounds and have them removed.\n\nIf they created a system, how would it work? Somebody there judging if the picture was unflattering enough to be removed? Would they make people crop out that part of the picture? Imagine the volume of pictures reported everyday is, that is probably a good number of people who would need to be hired for such a silly job.\n\nThe easiest way for facebook to handle it is just to let people untag themselves in pictures they don't want linked to their profile. Beyond that, if you want a friend to take something down, take it up with them yourself. Facebook doesn't want to be forcing people to remove their content they want to share, just because someone else doesn't want it shared because they don't like how it makes them look.

Be calm and rational. \n\"Hi - I think it is really inappropriate that you have posted this image when I asked you politely not to do so. As you can see i am super uncomfortable in this photo and actually I screamed in disgust which (thankfully) forced the stripper to move on. It is in no way representative of my nature and I think it is extremely distasteful that you have shared this on facebook knowing full well my friends and family would be exposed to this image. Kindly remove it please. \"\n\nIf she comes back with any of her \"My policy\" bullshit - then ask her. \"Why are your policies more important than my feelings. I think that is very selfish of you\"\n\nIf you stay calm and rational - she will be exposed as being an insenstive twat. \n\n\n\nThen delete her from your facebook BUT ALSO YOUR LIFE. She is a terribly selfish and destructive force. Do not let her influence back into your sphere. Good luck!\n\n\nEdit: If she pulls the \"what - it's a cute photo LOL\" card then make sure you screenshot the private conversations of her saying \"it doesn't matter if you are offended because I am not offended\" and then post that image on her timeline. Exposing her for the rotten insensitive troll she is.  I'd *love* to have a screenshot of our conversation, but it happened over the phone. \n\nI'm worried that commenting on the photo would draw more attention to it, but I think if she doesn't remove it this evening I might have to take your advice and write something. Staying calm and rational will be the hard part I guess.  Engage her again on FB private chat. Reiterate your comments. Her behaviour is severely out of line and you must protect yourself.\n\nCommenting on the photo? Well I think it is important that you publicly express your disapproval.After all, the biatch publicly *shamed and humiliated* you. You need to be brave and pro active about this.\n\n I don't feel very brave or proactive, I just feel like shit right now :-(\n\nI'm trying to plan out what to say in a comment, but it's hard. I don't want to start a shit-fight, I just want her to take the damn photo down... Oh I totally understand. I'm so sorry.\n\nI do think born_redditor's advice is the best though. If facebook won't take it down for you, you have to rely on this girl taking it down herself. If she won't do it out of basic fucking human decency, of which she apparently has none, then maybe she'll do it out of embarrassment. You're gonna have to shame her.\n\nIf you're uneasy about starting drama, which I totally understand, then two things: 1) constantly repeat to yourself that you are *not* starting drama; *SHE* started this drama, and 2) maybe let us do the talking for you? Why not just copy/paste exactly what born_redditor wrote above? And I would advise that you don't even respond to anything that she may write back. \n\nPost this comment (born_redditor's words):  \"Hi - I think it is really inappropriate that you have posted this image when I asked you politely not to do so. As you can see i am super uncomfortable in this photo and actually I screamed in disgust which (thankfully) forced the stripper to move on. It is in no way representative of my nature and I think it is extremely distasteful that you have shared this on facebook knowing full well my friends and family would be exposed to this image. Kindly remove it please.\"\n\nThen only four things can possibly happen; here's how you respond to all of them:\n\n1) She writes back something snarky. YOUR RESPONSE: none. You've said your piece, anyone who sees the photo will know you didn't consent to it, it isn't representative of you, and she's a bitch for not taking it down after you asked.\n\n2) She deletes your comment. YOUR RESPONSE: repost the exact comment. If she deletes it again, repost your comment again. Keep doing this until she gets so tired of it that she either takes down the photo, or at least lets your comment remain.\n\n3) Other people start commenting either in support or opposition of you. YOUR RESPONSE: None. Same as #1, you've said your piece. \n\n4) She deletes the photo. YOUR RESPONSE: sigh of relief!\n\n\nGood luck. Oh I totally understand. I'm so sorry.\n\nI do think born_redditor's advice is the best though. If facebook won't take it down for you, you have to rely on this girl taking it down herself. If she won't do it out of basic fucking human decency, of which she apparently has none, then maybe she'll do it out of embarrassment. You're gonna have to shame her.\n\nIf you're uneasy about starting drama, which I totally understand, then two things: 1) constantly repeat to yourself that you are *not* starting drama; *SHE* started this drama, and 2) maybe let us do the talking for you? Why not just copy/paste exactly what born_redditor wrote above? And I would advise that you don't even respond to anything that she may write back. \n\nPost this comment (born_redditor's words):  \"Hi - I think it is really inappropriate that you have posted this image when I asked you politely not to do so. As you can see i am super uncomfortable in this photo and actually I screamed in disgust which (thankfully) forced the stripper to move on. It is in no way representative of my nature and I think it is extremely distasteful that you have shared this on facebook knowing full well my friends and family would be exposed to this image. Kindly remove it please.\"\n\nThen only four things can possibly happen; here's how you respond to all of them:\n\n1) She writes back something snarky. YOUR RESPONSE: none. You've said your piece, anyone who sees the photo will know you didn't consent to it, it isn't representative of you, and she's a bitch for not taking it down after you asked.\n\n2) She deletes your comment. YOUR RESPONSE: repost the exact comment. If she deletes it again, repost your comment again. Keep doing this until she gets so tired of it that she either takes down the photo, or at least lets your comment remain.\n\n3) Other people start commenting either in support or opposition of you. YOUR RESPONSE: None. Same as #1, you've said your piece. \n\n4) She deletes the photo. YOUR RESPONSE: sigh of relief!\n\n\nGood luck. I'd *love* to have a screenshot of our conversation, but it happened over the phone. \n\nI'm worried that commenting on the photo would draw more attention to it, but I think if she doesn't remove it this evening I might have to take your advice and write something. Staying calm and rational will be the hard part I guess. If it's an old photo and you comment on it it will be brought up in people's newsfeeds again as saying \"so and so commented on this photo.\"  I would refrain from commenting on it actually as it will just bring more attention.  If it's been up for a long time most people will have forgotten about it.  If you're untagged in it people who search you will not be able to see it, they will only see it through her photos.\n\nIt's completely wrong of her to keep it up and I'm not condoning her at all, just letting you know what will happen.  I would continue to contact facebook and report the photo directly.  They're usually pretty good about taking things down.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you and I hope it gets resolved quickly! If it is still on her page, write a comment under it telling her that is inappropriate for her to post this photo without your ~~approval~~ consent. Be calm and rational. \n\"Hi - I think it is really inappropriate that you have posted this image when I asked you politely not to do so. As you can see i am super uncomfortable in this photo and actually I screamed in disgust which (thankfully) forced the stripper to move on. It is in no way representative of my nature and I think it is extremely distasteful that you have shared this on facebook knowing full well my friends and family would be exposed to this image. Kindly remove it please. \"\n\nIf she comes back with any of her \"My policy\" bullshit - then ask her. \"Why are your policies more important than my feelings. I think that is very selfish of you\"\n\nIf you stay calm and rational - she will be exposed as being an insenstive twat. \n\n\n\nThen delete her from your facebook BUT ALSO YOUR LIFE. She is a terribly selfish and destructive force. Do not let her influence back into your sphere. Good luck!\n\n\nEdit: If she pulls the \"what - it's a cute photo LOL\" card then make sure you screenshot the private conversations of her saying \"it doesn't matter if you are offended because I am not offended\" and then post that image on her timeline. Exposing her for the rotten insensitive troll she is.   I don't think you have to tell her about your past to say \"I did not consent to touching the stripper, he forced my hand down his pants. That is a picture of me being sexually violated and extremely distressed and you have put it on the Internet for my friends and family to see.\"   Since you untagged yourself from the photo, I'm assuming it's no longer on your timeline- but if it is, go to the x button next to the picture and click \"hide.\" As far as getting the picture off your friend's timeline, you can't-- the only thing I can suggest is deleting her (which she might deserve anyway). However, if your family/friends haven't seen it yet and you've now deleted it/untagged yourself, they won't be able to see it on her page (unless they are friends with her?)... and I'm guessing employers haven't seen it, which is good. :) It's not on my timeline anymore - thank god! We do have lots of mutual friends though, including some of my family. She's also facebook friends with at least three people working at a company I've just been offered a week of contract work at, which has the potential to turn into something more if people there find me good to work with. One of them (her cousin) already liked the picture, so I know at least one employer has potentially seen it.\n\nI'm thinking I'll have to delete her, but I really want to see if I can have facebook remove the images first. I can't stand the thought of not being able to see her wall, and knowing that this picture is there with people liking it and commenting on it.  I know you've already contacted Facebook to have them removed, but do so again. In your explanation, state that the picture is of an act you did not consent to, that the picture is of you being sexually assaulted.  I can't give an explanation, facebook doesn't allow it. When they rejected my report, they did have an option for feedback, and I've left some there telling them the context. Ah, apologies for not knowing how the reporting system worked. I'm sorry this is happening to you.  Depending on local law, you  can possibly find a lawyer (maybe even a free one) who can take actions.\n\nThe basis on which you'd be suing would be her infringing on your [personality rights] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights). \n\nThough this, obviously, will mean cutting her out of your life forever (which, given the circumstances, is not a bad thing though). Unfortunately she's a relative of my partner. If I tool legal action none of his family would ever speak to me again, and probably wouldn't speak to him again either. \n\nFinding a lawyer for advice is probably a good idea though. I'd like to find out if there's a law against what she's done, though I'm not hopeful. If she's a relative of your partner, why hasn't your partner kicked her ass yet? He called her to ask for the pictures to be taken down, which resulted in a 20 minute rant about how it doesn't matter how I feel, it only matters how she feels, why am I so upset, it's not her fault I'm so sensitive, I shouldn't care what my family think about the picture, etc. He then got rewarded with a barrage of angry text messages for the duration of the night, none of which he replied to. She then called his parents, who came down hard on him for \"making *(name)* stressed\". \n\nSo if there's going to be any arse-kicking, it's going to be me doing it. I don't want to put my S/O in an awkward position with his family. It's a lot easier if they end up hating me vs hating him and me. I'm sorry, but this woman definitely needs a reality check by getting sued. Even if she's not actually paying any damages, it might scare some sense into her.\n\nThat being said, awkward or not, this is the point where your SO needs to choose you over his family.\n\nIf you ever see her again, tell her flat out you do not allow her to take ANY picture of you anymore. But I'd just advise cutting contact altogether. I just think suing will make it worse, to be honest. She's a real right-fighter, if she's challenged it's percieved as a personal attack, and if I sued her she would go to the grave insisting that she behaved the right way. I'm not interested in damages from her or stressing her out too much because we're both shit poor, and I know I sure as heck couldn't cope with someone suing me while I'm in this position. I just couldn't do it to her. The friendship is absolutely over, and I will go out of my way to never see her or speak to her again in my life, but I don't want to hurt her.\n\nMy S/O has been wonderful through this, really. He's stuck up for me to her and to his parents. I'm trying not to make things worse for him but he's more concerned about helping me fix this than keeping the peace with his family. He's a keeper, for sure :) I'm not a lawyer, but I wasn't really intending you ask damages, more like a preliminary injunction to force her to take down the pic. Unfortunately she's a relative of my partner. If I tool legal action none of his family would ever speak to me again, and probably wouldn't speak to him again either. \n\nFinding a lawyer for advice is probably a good idea though. I'd like to find out if there's a law against what she's done, though I'm not hopeful. I'm not sure if the personality rights would apply. Mainly because the picture isn't being used for commercial purposes (and posting on facebook is most likely not consider commercial). Although a lot of that would depend on your countries laws so getting some advice from a lawyer is a good idea. :) I'm going into the business district of my city tomorrow for something unrelated. I know there's a free legal help clinic in there somewhere, and I plan to find it. I'm not planning on actually taking any legal action, but I really want to know where I stand and what my rights are in this situation. Out of curiosity, would you mind updating us (or at least me) on what they tell you your rights are in the situation? I completely understand if you don't want to go into which local/state laws are directly violated to ensure you remain anonymous, but just a general overview I would really appreciate. I just have a lot of interest in the legal system, and situations like this one. I'm willing to do that, yes. I hope no one here is ever in the situation I'm in, but if they are they should have some general knowledge about what they can do. When I get advice I'll figure out how to edit my post and share it. Thank you very much! I really appreciate it! Hopefully you find some way to get her to take it down, it's pretty ridiculous how she is handling the whole situation! I've updated my post to include the advice I got from a lawyer.  Interesting, thanks for the update. I'm kind of surprised that is the response you got, but again best of luck to you in your attempts to get her to remove it.  I am really, really sorry. The reasons you gave should be more than good enough for her to have some understanding and take down the photo. What an immature little brat. Have you explained to her that during the time the picture was taken, you were having flashbacks to being sexually assaulted? And that seeing that photo makes you extremely uncomfortable? Perhaps if you explain it to her in this way, she will understand more.\n\nEither way, I think you should lose this friend after the photo business is figured out. She doesn't sound like a person who respects others. I thought so too. She gave an example of what a good reason would be in her eyes. Apparently if there was a photo taken of someone and their S/O kissing, and then this person had a breakup and got a new partner, she would remove the photo so as to prevent awkwardness. I'm absolutely stunned that she thinks this is a good reason, but not wanting friends and family to see a picture of a naked man sitting on you is a bad reason.\n\nI don't really want to tell her about the assault. I've kept it close to my chest since it happened, only my partner knows about it and I don't want to share it with her - especially not now! I have absolutely zero trust in her now.\n\nI definitely will lose her as a friend after all of this. It's a shame, because she can be really lovely, but she's crossed a line here. Thanks for the support :) I thought that might be the case, and you definitely have *no* obligation to tell her about it. Like I said, those reasons you already gave her should be more than good enough. Good luck! : )  You can also try to have FB remove the picture. Go to the pic and click \"options\", then \"report/remove tag\". You should then get a menu which let's you choose \"It's harassing me or someone I know\".\n I've done that, and I got a response a few minutes ago saying that the photos aren't harassment, so they're staying up. I've reported them again as pornography, which is a long shot, but I'm hoping it might work. You can't actually see the stripper's genitals, but it's clear that he's not wearing clothes, and there's a penis-shaped drinking straw in the background of the photograph. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that maybe facebook will think this is too risque.\n\nI'm completely at a loss. They'll remove photos of someone breastfeeding, but not photos of something like this. Yes, sadly they seem to act fast on female nudity, and not so much on male nudity.\n\nBut keep trying, even if they refuse. I have reported posts (hate speech) before, and received the automated \"we don't think it goes against our policy\" answer. There's an option to reply to those messages, which I use to question the automated answer, and that seems to result in a actual person reviewing the report (and sometimes the removal of the post). \n\nGood luck! I didn't know about the feedback option! Thank you thank you thank you!!\n\nI'll leave feedback on it now and explain the context. Maybe that will result in them removing the picture.\n\nThank you so much! You're welcome, I hope it works.\n\nSomething else you could try is getting your mutual friends on board. The more people reporting the pic, the more serious FB will take the complaint.\n If you can tell them, inform them that your 'friend' is breaking the terms and conditions of facebook. \nFrom their terms and agreements.\n3.6 - You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user. (You find this harassment, therefore they should do something about it)\n3.7 - You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence. (I'm guessing it contains nudity to a certain extent.)\n\nSecondly underneath the facebook community standards, it says: -Facebook does not tolerate bullying or harassment. We allow users to speak freely on matters and people of public interest, but take action on all reports of abusive behavior directed at private individuals. (They have not taken action)\n\nNot sure if any of that would be helpful, but I thought I'd post.\n\n If you can tell them, inform them that your 'friend' is breaking the terms and conditions of facebook. \nFrom their terms and agreements.\n3.6 - You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.

The more people reporting the pic, the more serious FB will take the complaint.\n    Please keep us updated  I read through the other replies, maybe I missed something but I didn't see anyone ask if you reported the photo? I know for a fact - at least on my Facebook, and I don't see why I'd be the only person able to do this - when I untag myself from a photo I can also report the photo to possibly have it deleted. I've never had to do this so I'm not sure what would actually happened, but I took some screen shots.\n\n[This](http://imgur.com/k3qKglL) is what happened when I clicked \"Remove/report tag\" on a photo I was actually tagged in, however I have my privacy settings set so that no one but me can see my tagged photos, however anyone can see photos of me if we have mutual friends who put them up. Duh, but sometimes embarrassing.\n\n[This](http://imgur.com/X5Os4fC) is what happened when I clicked \"Remove/report tag\" on a photo I was not tagged in, I just went to one of my boyfriend's older profile photos to see if I could report it. If your \"friend\" still has the photo up, and you still have access to it, maybe try reporting it? You could report her whole profile if you wanted to, for harassment or something of that sort.\n\nHonestly, I'm appalled at her behavior, I truly am. I really hope everything works out for you. TwoX has your back :) *hugs*  She is not your friend if she's shaming you, making you \"deal with\" the photos, and just being a bitch. Talk to her and if she doesn't come around, cut ties.  Oh we are *absolutely* not friends anymore. I want to keep in contact until I can be 100% sure the photos are gone, then we're through. Good for you. I'm not friends with her either. [**We** are done with her.](http://media.tumblr.com/cdf7f4c7d2273ecbe02985f39e57f754/tumblr_inline_mgoitlCZkU1rxis0k.gif) SOLIDARITY, homegurl.   That's given me the biggest smile I've had all day! You're awesome.  Face might delete them for being nude pictures but they will not delete them for being unflattering sadly.  That's the difficulty I've run into. The photo stops at his waist, so you cal tell he's naked, but can't actually see his genitals. Facebook says this isn't nudity.  Are you able to report the photo for depiction of nudity?\n\n&gt;You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\n\nThis is from the [Terms of Use](http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) (under \"Safety\", #7) which specifies that a photo of the type you described would not be appropriate for the site, so I find it odd that you received a response that they can't be removed. Did you provide an adequate description that there was a naked man in the photo when you were initially denied by Facebook?\n\nYour \"friend\" is a jerk for not respecting your privacy especially since it may affect your job search. How old is she in the first place and has she considered that what she shares on social networking sites could potentially affect *her* as well?    I would comment on that picture. \n\"Please take this down. My personal space was violated that night and now you are violating my privacy by taking a picture of, and posting an event in my life where I felt violated and extremely uncomfortable.\" I'm thinking about it. Mainly I'm worried that commenting on it will bring more attention to the picture, but if facebook won't remove it I'm not sure I have another option but to comment.  If you had Facebook Timeline before she uploaded the picture, it was never on your wall, and you were never tagged in it.\n\nTimeline has a \"profile review\" option where you have to approve all pictures you're tagged in before they go on your profile. (I might have had to turn it on, though?)\n\n:( I'm really sorry this happened to you. There's a pretty good chance none of your friends or family have seen the picture, unless they're *also* friends with her, though. Thanks for the support :-)\n\nI think that might be something you have to activate yourself. I have friends sharing pictures and articles on my wall all the time, and I never have to approve anything, so I guess that's something I'll need to change.\n\nUnfortunately we have lots of mutual friends, including my partner's family, some of my family, and some people who work in a company I'm gunning for a job at.  I have lots of Internet hugs if you want them! &lt;3\n\nI've been super intense about screening my FaceBook picture tags and stuff ever since Halloween a few years ago when a girl I knew took a bunch of pictures at a Rocky Horror show. Pictures that involved me in a bra licking chocolate and whipped cream off other people . . . I got called a slut at the family Christmas &gt;_&gt; That's horrible! I'm sorry that happened to you.  That's horrible! I'm sorry that happened to you.   **I put some political articles on my facebook sometimes, and she said that my political views might drive away an employer, so I have no right to complain about what she's done!**\n\nHow can she say that?\nTechnically, having politcal articles on your facebook makes you look smarter, kinda more developed. Putting those type of pics that your friend did will most likely signal your potential employer that you might not seem like an individual they want to entrust you with their business after seeing those images.\n\nYou've shown already that you have superior understanding of how the real world works. Having her brush it off as something not as dramatic as you make it seem like makes it look like she doesn't care about your feelings. If you are not comfortable with that online , she has absolutely no right to put them up there. A lot of people doing stupid shit like that get sued, if she can't even consider what the consequences of her actions might lead her to, then I don't think she has reached that level of understanding of how her actions can get her in trouble.   From what I've seen you say about the photo, it doesn't sound like it meets any of the requirements for facebook to remove it. They are unlikely to get into the business of removing pictures that people are unhappy with having posted, it is just too messy and too subjective.\n\nA number of people have mentioned harassment, I'm not sure posting a picture really constitutes harassing someone, I think it would take something more than just having it posted (say repeatedly tagging you in it).\n\nYou have every right to control what is on your profile, which you did by untagging yourself. You don't have the right to control what other people post though, unless it goes against the rules of facebook. Obviously, the decent thing for her to do is just take it down at your request, but she doesn't legally have to just because you don't like it.\n\nThe chances of employers going through your friends pictures is unlikely, especially considering the person searching may not have ever seen you to identify you in a few pictures out of a few thousand. That said, in some fields you can in trouble or even fired just for having pictures like this come out (think politics is the easiest example), in those situations you really just have to avoid getting into situations where there is the chance of compromising pictures being taken though, once they are taken you can't get them back.\n\nYour best bet at this point is to try and find someway to get her to take it down on her own accord. Commenting on the picture, like many other people have mentioned, is probably the best bet as it moves the burden onto her to either act, respond, or publicly look like the crappy person she is acting like.  Ok, I understand this is a trigger for you, but I also think you are being a bit to sensitive about the photo.\n\nI would however start a private thread to this woman and giving her the real reason why it makes you uncomfortable. Yes it's not flattering, but I'm guessing the real reason you're so upset is because it triggers your previous attack and brings up bad memories. Give the woman some insight into your attack, and she may be more sensitive. Not telling her the whole story has made her unsympathetic to what you're really feeling.\n\nIf she doesn't then remove it, at least you will have written evidence of her being a careless douche... Then send that interaction to facebook and tell them that you will be hiring a lawyer if they don't get her to remove it. Either way, untag yourself and unfriend this woman.  It's difficult to explain without sharing the photo, but because the picture is cut off at the man's waist, it's not obvious that he's grabbing my hand. It just looks as if I'm groping him. It looks *very* sexual. She knew at the time that I wasn't thrilled about what happened, though she didn't know that I was really upset. I made it clear to her when I discovered the picture on facebook that it really upset me. She doesn't know what's behind it, but she knows exactly how upset I am. She's very aware that I've been a complete wreck for the past few days because of this, but she's completely indifferent anyway. I strongly believe that if she knew about the assault she would still keep the photo up, and in any case, I don't think I should have to share this with her. I absolutely do not trust her now, and I've not told anyone what happened with the exception of my partner. There's no way I can tell her, and even if I did she wouldn't remove the picture. She's already said that what happened with the stripper was my fault.\n\nI'm going to stay facebook friends with her until I can confirm that the pictures are removed. Then I intend to defriend her and never speak with her again. I get that it bothers you, really I do, but I still stand behind my previous statement, it only matters to you. An outsider would just look at it and think \"meh, just a girl having fun\". Letting it get under your skin is not healthy for you. Really, this picture means nothing to anybody else. There are pics like this of me on facebook, I don't care, my partner doesn't care. Facebook is nothing... It's not the real world. This picture isn't worth your upset. \n\nLetting her know how upset you are is only going to make her dig her heals in more. Right now she thinks you're a busy body, uptight freak. Which in her brain is only going to increase her sick sense of \"this girl needs to relax and I'm right\". Her ego is feeding this whole thing. Let her know the back ground story and I'm sure she will reconsider... \n\nSitting here whinging about how bad it is and dwelling on it are not healthy for your mind. It's time to move on. That's why I suggest unfriending her... Let go of the things you cannot control. Worrying is serving you no purpose, except draining you of your ability to live. I support what you're saying. Most people would probably just laugh and think, \"girl looks like she had fun!\", but I also understand that it is traumatic for OP. \n\nAs a tactful human being, I never would have posted pics of that nature without consulting OP first or hiding it so far back in a folder as to never see the light of day, and absolutely not tagging OP in it. If requested to remove, I would have. \n\nWith that said, OP, people are assholes and although she's related to your SO, unfriend her immediately and stop all contact. I don't think you should have to entertain her childish and selfish ways. Quality, not quantity, &lt; when it comes to friends. Sometimes you have to let people go in your life that don't have your best interest at heart. \n\nThis incident may seem small to some redditors, but it's an indication of the picture poster's flawed character. She may be nice, fun, whatever, but she's not empathetic or tactful. Two biggies in my book. \n\n*off soapbox*  I agree completely with what you're saying. It is traumatic, but she doesn't want to explain why to the person who posted the pic and she doesn't want to delete the idiot. \n\nI don't post risque pictures of anyone for this exact reason. I will email them to the person and tell them they can do what they want with them. The one person who posted a pic of me with a stripper in my lap (from when I was 19) isn't my friend anymore. Is the pic still up? I assume so. Do I care? Not one bit. Has it ever between brought back up? Not once.  Ok, I understand this is a trigger for you, but I also think you are being a bit to sensitive about the photo.\n\nI would however start a private thread to this woman and giving her the real reason why it makes you uncomfortable. Yes it's not flattering, but I'm guessing the real reason you're so upset is because it triggers your previous attack and brings up bad memories.

Not telling her the whole story has made her unsympathetic to what you're really feeling.\n\nIf she doesn't then remove it, at least you will have written evidence of her being a careless douche... Then send that interaction to facebook and tell them that you will be hiring a lawyer if they don't get her to remove it. Either way, untag yourself and unfriend this woman.  I don't think she is being over sensitive. I also don't think we have a right to post pictures of our “friends” that they don't want seen. I have posted pics before that friends have seen as unflattering, and when they ask me to take them down I do. I usually apologize as well for the misunderstanding. While I agree with you about not posting pics, unfortunately those are facebook's rule of engagement. Don't like it? Don't use it. I'm just trying to get the OP to realize how useless this worrying is. Nobody died, nobody lost a limb. Worrying about these photos is only draining her. No one else.  Her not using facebook won't change that other people do. Other people that she does not want to see the photos. You're missing the point though. No one can control what another person does. This isn't worth worrying over cause she can't change it. Yes, she doesn't want people to see it, but it's obviously not risque enough to force facebook to remove it. There are bigger issues to fry, this is a bit of a first world problem. If you read through the comments of people who have gotten facebook pictures taken down, they tend to not have very strict terms (or just don't care) with a first complaint. If she is diligent she *can* change it. I don't see how having pictures of oneself being forced into any sort of sexual contact against one's will posted online is a “first world problem”. It is degrading, and I honestly find out bothersome that people can just brush something like that off. I don't think she is being over sensitive. I also don't think we have a right to post pictures of our “friends” that they don't want seen. I have posted pics before that friends have seen as unflattering, and when they ask me to take them down I do. I usually apologize as well for the misunderstanding. I apologize for how nitpicky this may seem, but I think people do generally have the right to share pictures of people they do not want shared. There are obviously limits to that (child pornography comes to mind).\n\nThink about things like pictures of Michael Phelps smoking pot, I seriously doubt he wanted those to be posted on the internet, but people had the right to post them.\n\nWith something like this, I think the person does have the right to do it, but it is a very crappy thing to do to exercise that right, and certainly not a right that a \"friend\" would take advantage of.\n\nI would equate it to trash talking your friend behind their back. You have the right to do it, but that doesn't mean you aren't an awful friend if you do.  Except in this case she was not a willing participant. I doubt Phelps was being coerced into smoking the pot. I am sorry, but that is a poor analogy. Now of she was wasted at a party and flagged a camera, I could see your argument holding ground. Not the same thing.\n\n*edit: I see this as closer to when that girl was raped at the party and people took pictures and shared. * Except in this case she was not a willing participant. I doubt Phelps was being coerced into smoking the pot. I am sorry, but that is a poor analogy. Now of she was wasted at a party and flagged a camera, I could see your argument holding ground. Not the same thing.\n\n*edit: I see this as closer to when that girl was raped at the party and people took pictures and shared. * I apologize for how nitpicky this may seem, but I think people do generally have the right to share pictures of people they do not want shared. There are obviously limits to that (child pornography comes to mind).\n\nThink about things like pictures of Michael Phelps smoking pot, I seriously doubt he wanted those to be posted on the internet, but people had the right to post them.\n\nWith something like this, I think the person does have the right to do it, but it is a very crappy thing to do to exercise that right, and certainly not a right that a \"friend\" would take advantage of.\n\nI would equate it to trash talking your friend behind their back. You have the right to do it, but that doesn't mean you aren't an awful friend if you do.  Ok, I understand this is a trigger for you, but I also think you are being a bit to sensitive about the photo.\n\nI would however start a private thread to this woman and giving her the real reason why it makes you uncomfortable. Yes it's not flattering, but I'm guessing the real reason you're so upset is because it triggers your previous attack and brings up bad memories. Give the woman some insight into your attack, and she may be more sensitive. Not telling her the whole story has made her unsympathetic to what you're really feeling.\n\nIf she doesn't then remove it, at least you will have written evidence of her being a careless douche... Then send that interaction to facebook and tell them that you will be hiring a lawyer if they don't get her to remove it. Either way, untag yourself and unfriend this woman.  I don't think she is being too sensitive. It's a potentially career killing, humiliating picture from an event that she wasn't even consenting to. Drama much? Career killing in a photo that is no longer tagged as her? Please be realistic. I don't mind the discussion, but this is not a life or death experience. The OP wasting time over someone who doesn't really care about her, lamenting over a photo that she can't control is not helping. You obviously don't have a job working with the public. \n\nA photo like that could get me fired if *anyone* involved with my job saw it, even if I went back and untagged it. The same goes with the organizations I volunteer with. It presents a poor image of the employee (and by proxy the company or organization) to the public. You are the one who is being unrealistic.  If this is your situation, then you shouldn't be on facebook. Everyone is talking like facebook is some inalienable right, and god forbid someone messes with your facebook. If you have a problem with facebook, leave facebook. facebook is complained about so fucking much, yet everyones still got one. I don't really put myself in such compromising situations to begin with. I don't generally drink in public, I definitely don't use strippers. I am not too concerned personally. And that extends beyond facebook and into my life in general. I am very private. \n\nI am also against people abusing the trust of their friends, which is what happened to OP. This situation isn't the fault of facebook, it is the fault of her \"friend\" behaving like a terrible human being and publicly humiliating her. There are a variety of venues she could have chosen to do it through, but she just so happened to use facebook. Ok, but you can't control other people, only yourself, so what's the point of complaining about other's behavior, when changing your own could solve the problem? You can't predict the betrayal of people you trust. If you could, then they wouldn't be people you trust.  Exactly. You can't control or predict other people, only yourself. Concentrate on the things you can control would be my advice. I wouldn't be shocked if someone did something disparaging about me on facebook, so I don't use facebook. That's my response, instead of complaining. You obviously don't have a job working with the public. \n\nA photo like that could get me fired if *anyone* involved with my job saw it, even if I went back and untagged it. The same goes with the organizations I volunteer with. It presents a poor image of the employee (and by proxy the company or organization) to the public. You are the one who is being unrealistic.  Actually, I work with the public everyday and I have a very public profile. If something like this were to happen to me, I still wouldn't stress about it. Nor would I worry about being fired. Changing your outlook can change everything, including how people treat you. What kind of work do you actually do?\n\nI am a supervisor at a home health agency and I am a volunteer firefighter. It is explicitly stated in the employee agreements for both of these organizations that I *must* present a positive public image and failure to do so will lead to termination. The same goes for my sister, the elementary school teacher, and my brother, the mid level government bureaucrat. \n\nMy \"outlook\" has nothing to do with it. My employee contract does. I would be *fired*. No discussion. They wouldn't give a single fuck *how* I felt about it, I would have broken the terms of my employment. So yes, I would be very worried about getting fired under those circumstances. And being fired for something that qualified as \"improper conduct\" would be a huge black mark on my employment record forever. It is a big deal.  I'm a RMT, I own my own business and I'm a board member for several volunteer organizations. I have a very public social profile. If your positions are so sensitive that you would get fired for a photo that you have no control over and your bosses/board/volunteer member's have no context over, then you shouldn't be participating in facebook. I'm not saying that in a mean way, I'm saying it in a \"wow, facebook is not worth the risk for you\".\n\nNow if you or the OP had posted these photos yourself, then yes you risk being fired and rightfully so. I take my profile seriously, I never post anything that a patient or potential sponsor could see, but I certainly wouldn't worry about a photo that has no connection to me. And they're ok of you posting pictures of yourself, giving handjobs to strippers on your facebook page? \n\n&gt;If your positions are so sensitive that you would get fired for a photo that you have no control over and your bosses/board/volunteer member's have no context over, then you shouldn't be participating in facebook. \n\nI am not exceptionally worried about it, personally, because I don't socialize outside of professional settings very often. That being said, the OP has every right to be upset over this individual who she believed to be her friend betraying her. We can't go through life distrusting everyone and hiding from the world. It is reasonable to expect friends to respect your wishes and not post images that could be hazardous to your employment or personal life. \n\nIt is a very common practice for companies to have a strong interest in protecting their public image. The best way to control this is to not go into compromising situations. But the OP didn't consent to having her hand placed on the stripper's genitals, nor did she consent to having that event photographed. \n\nI also want to point out that you can still be recognized on facebook by employers even if you don't have a facebook account. That is, if you socialize with any coworkers outside of work. Wow. Are you sure you're not a troll? Neither myself nor the OP are posting pics with us giving people handjobs. Further more, the OP even states that the picture doesn't show anything explicit. \n\nYes, you can still be recognized, but who has that much time? You need to remember what the original complaint was in this thread. My response was don't get worked up about something you can't control... This isn't worth losing sleep over. Ok, I understand this is a trigger for you, but I also think you are being a bit to sensitive about the photo.\n\nI would however start a private thread to this woman and giving her the real reason why it makes you uncomfortable.

Then send that interaction to facebook and tell them that you will be hiring a lawyer if they don't get her to remove it. Either way, untag yourself and unfriend this woman.  \"Too sensitive\"? Is it possible to be \"too sensitive\" about being sexually assaulted (which is exactly what that stripper did to her), and having that experience documented and shown publicly? OP has every right and reason to be angry about this, and what her \"friend\" is doing is inexcusable. It doesn't matter if that girl doesn't know the history behind it--she does know that OP was forced into a sex act, and she decided to take a picture of it and share it on Facebook anyways. What kind of terrible person does that, and then thinks that their own \"photo rule\" is more important than the incredible mental distress of someone else?\n\nNow, there is a photo online of OP in a position where it apparently looks like she's giving some guy a handjob. You're very lucky if you feel that that situation wouldn't have the potential to ruin your life. I can guarantee that, if this happened to me and anyone I work with saw it, I would be out of a job instantly. This is a big deal.\n\nNext time you want to give advice to someone who's been through something traumatic, try not to belittle their emotions. It's incredibly rude.",

Half of your audience is female! You're not just addressing men, and frankly, men shouldn't need to be reminded that women = your wives, mothers, daughters, as in 'oh yeah, I should care about them, shouldn't I?' \n\nIt just makes it sound like we're not important in and of ourselves, just in relation to the men in our lives, and I'm just really sick of male, even liberal politicians who I respect, using rhetoric like this. \n\nAny thoughts? I guess I just felt like ranting. \n\nEdit: I know that they're trying to make it seem personable, otherwise why bother with the extra syllables? It's just that since half the audience *is* female, and men *should* sort of already know that they care about the women in their lives, we shouldn't have to make a sales pitch to qualify talking about women's rights. \n\nAlso what about unmarried, childless women?

    "snippet" : "  I'm not agreeing with her speech but it does bring up the reverse pressure to be highly casual about sex, have lots of partners without getting emotionally attached,and not be so \"old fashioned\". While it's important woman not be shamed for their sexuality, we shouldn't disregard the counter booing at those who are adverse to hookup culture. I never want a woman to feel like she isn't a liberated enough feminist because she prefers a long term committed relationship and extreme trust to express her sexuality. Because I've seen women do that-beat themselves up because they can't muster up the drive to be promiscuous and 'fun', and no strings attached. They are bombarded by pressure to accept Friends with Benefits and feel like frigid, emotionally stunted, bitches for having other needs. That said, her detour into \"35yr average lifespan\"and Science Will Make You Want Babies, was cringe worthy.   uh yeah, and...I just skimmed it so I could have gotten it wrong, but isn't she saying \"get married young and have babies\"...?     Women don't like casual sex.\n\nDoes that make me a man now? That's going to be an awkward conversation. \"Hey honey, turns out you're gay?\"   Holy... SHIT the comments on that article.\n\nDon't do it unless you feel like losing some more faith in humanity today. Oh god. I did it. I read comments. It was horrible. Holy... SHIT the comments on that article.\n\nDon't do it unless you feel like losing some more faith in humanity today. I think this one is my favorite:\n\n\"Ladies, your ONE bargaining chip; sex, like the ring decreases in value every time it's used, every time it's given away to some guy at a Halloween party or some guy after a third date.\"\n\nIf sex is the one and only thing you have going for you, you should probably find a hobby or a personality or something. Also, in a relationship, sex shouldn't be a bargaining chip. It's not, \"If you do the dishes then I'll have sex with you\". It's something you do because you love the person and want to share that pleasure with them (again, speaking it the context of a relationship/marriage. Love is not required for sex).\n\nThe same person also said this:\n\n\"it's not a special activity conveying commitment -it's nothing more than a fun Friday night activity.\"\n\nYes, you're right, it's an epic Friday night activity. And a Wednesday night activity, if you want. Hmm...maybe I can pry my boyfriend away from his games for a moment...      Wow, I did not think anyone could write such a piece of awful presumptuousness. It was just fraught with bad logic, disguised as facts and arguments and an \"everything-was-better-before\"-tone.

    "snippet" : "So I'm a very clean person.  Showers every day.  Good ones at that.  I spend about ~20 minutes in the shower making sure that each party of my body is scrubbed and clean and sparkling when I get out.\n\nAbout five entire minutes is spent cleaning my vagina.  I'm 25, a grad student, and extremely intelligent.  But despite this, for some reason, I can almost never get it to smell clean.\n\nThis is highly embarrassing and I'm afraid makes me sound naive, but I'm not quite sure where else to go about it and I thought you wonderful ladies might know.\n\nIt doesn't smell *bad* per se, when I'm done.

And by the time the day is finished, it's just . . . awful.\n\nI'm sure it's not a yeast infection or anything like that.\n\n5 minutes washing a single body part is quite a bit.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Any help would be appreciated for this horrifying question!

Thanks for making me laugh so loud I startled the dog awake.\n\nOP, I heard that using a capful of apple cider vinegar in your bath once or twice a week for 5-15 minutes does something positive for your lady bits. I've heard it a few times over the years but have not tried it myself. \n\nCan anyone verify/ bust that theory?

Wow. So just water like some people suggested?  I get the vagina is self-cleaning, but what about urine or whatever else that might get on the labia?  I don't wash my hands with just water if I accidentally get urine on them.  Urine is, technically speaking, sterile. We should really be washing our hands *before* urinating, in addition to after.\n\nNo soap. EVER. Even if you're using it around the outside, the stream of water can carry it into any crevices and can cause just as much havoc. Just let the vag do its thing. You're changing the delicate balance within the vagina when you use soap.

Certain cleansers that are perfectly acceptable to use on other parts of your body really shouldn't be used on your ladybits. \n\nAlso, it shouldn't take five minutes to clean down thurr. Contrary to what I said above, could you be over-cleaning it? Bar soap.  I use body wash on a loofah for the rest of my body but bar soap for my ladybits.\n\nOvercleaning?  Is that an issue?

If it's a strong smell, you should see a gynecologist, but you're more than likely normal. Depending on the time of the month, mine has a stronger smell. Strong enough where, frankly, if I take my underwear off I can smell it.  It just smells like sweat. &gt;Strong enough where, frankly, if I take my underwear off I can smell it.\n\nI've always heard that it's normal to be able to smell your vaginal smell when you're changing/taking off your underwear and that it's only abnormal if you're smelling it when your underwear is on.  Seriously, this kinda cured my fears.  As long as that's normal, fantastic. [deleted] Do NOT do this. Panty liners block airflow and trap bacteria (OK for brief uses for menstruation, but daily use = bad idea) and the cotton pulp from the pad can act as an abrasive agent against your ladybits (ie: cause irritation). Mum did this for years until her gyno found out about it and jokingly threatened to smack her.  Strong enough where, frankly, if I take my underwear off I can smell it.  It just smells like sweat. Have you tried maybe dusting your groin area (but NOT inside the vulva) with baby powder to absorb daily sweating? I have to do this when I wear skirts in summer or I get a rash from the moisture :-/ [No baby powder!](http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2011/04/08/study-links-baby-powder-use-to-ovarian-cancer/) That's Talc. Most BP now is cornstarch.  Have you tried maybe dusting your groin area (but NOT inside the vulva) with baby powder to absorb daily sweating?

I considered that, but I'm worried of the \"baby powder\" smell.  Does that exist? I considered that, but I'm worried of the \"baby powder\" smell.  Does that exist?  Omg, stop scrubbing your vagina, that is seriously not good for your foo.\n\nYour intellect has no bearing on the way your vagina smells. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your vagina smells like a vagina and that is how it is supposed to smell. Vaginas should smell like vaginas, not flowers, and using perfumed soaps down there can alter the pH of your punani- which rarely ends well and can actually cause infections which generate a bad smell. \n\nIf you are really that worried discuss it with your doctor. \n\nOtherwise, love your vagina.     The smell will never completely go away, and that's fine. You'll never make your vagina *not* smell like one. I find using soap etc though, for me, it just makes things *stink.* \n\nStop using soap. Clean yourself with water, and let your self cleaning vagina do the rest. It's truly an amazing ecosystem. Give your body a few weeks to adjust, and you'll probably find odour is greatly diminished. And remember, there are certain times of the month where it'll be a little stronger, that's unavoidable. \n\nOh, and wear cotton undies during the day, and go commando at night.\n\n\n     Do you wear tight pants a lot? I've noticed that the smell becomes a lot milder the more I wear pajama pants and shorts when I'm not at school. I do. Skin right jeans mostly. I also noticed that when I'm just lounging around my house, the smell doesn't get any stronger. Perhaps looser pants.            Do you remove hair from your pussy lips?  Because when I don't, it's funk town a few hours into a clean pair of underwear. Are you talking about the inside of the lips?  Or on he outside? I trim pretty closely but don't shave the area completely. I either Nair or shave it, so there's a bit of hair left on the inside of the lips, but it doesn't contribute to smell like a full-on pusstache. I would REALLY recommend *never* putting a chemical like Nair near your vagina. Really?  It's worked ok for me.  I use the sensitive version, and I'm vigilant about not leaving it on for more than 3-4 minutes.  I only use it on the outside. I either Nair or shave it, so there's a bit of hair left on the inside of the lips, but it doesn't contribute to smell like a full-on pusstache. ",

I was pretty bored, so I decided to play along. He got pictures of my slippers initially, and then my (male) SO's butt in a lacy thong (SO agreed to pose for this), which he seemed to like.  Finally I sent him a pic of my SO in the thong from the front.\n\nHe took it all in stride, said he'd had fun.

    "snippet" : "I am completely unsure of how to deal with this situation. I trust my fiance with all my heart and we have had the talk about the whole thing. He met this girl because she's the girlfriend of a closer friend and they've been texting pretty frequently. He hid it from me at first because he was unsure of how id react (Which was hell and not good because of the hiding) Now its all out in the open and we have discussed it. He explained to me that it is hard to have conversations with his guy friends about certain topics, and shes easy to talk to and its not about cheating or flirting or anything like that. Shes just straight up a good friend to him. She's extremely happy with her boyfriend  of 3 years and Hes happy with me.\n\nYET...\n\nIt makes me so damn uncomfortable, but I CANNOT be the girlfriend who controls her man on who he talks to. I think its utterly ridiculous when girls force their men to stop talking to people of the opposite sex. We have an pretty open relationship, and I have lots of guy friends that he knows I talk to and he's ok with it. Its just in the 4 years we've been together, hes never had another girl in his life besides his mom and sister so its all new territory for me.\n\n My question to you guys is how to get over this nauseating jealous feeling I have about her. I know she doesn't want him or anything thing like that yet it bothers me so. Its hard to talk to him about it because he feels like its a trust issue or a insecure issues, but to me its not. Now every time his phone goes off, I feel like I just hit the top of the beginning of a roller coaster and I'm heading straight down. I don't know why. I understand how sometimes you can't have the same type of conversations with you SO as you can with close friends. I talk to my guy friends on a daily basis. I just don't know how to stop feeling this way..\n\ntl;dr I need advice/suggestions on dealing with my jealousy over my fiances new girl pal.    Do you all hang out? Not yet, I was friends with her in high school. Shes a sweet girl. I just found out last week that he was talking to her. I know EXACTLY how you feel. I have gut reactions when a new female presence emerges into my bf's life and I know it has everything to do with me and not him. That doesn't stop the sick feeling I get that I can't seem to control. What does help is meeting the girl. It's easy to see in person if the relationship is purely platonic or if there are underlying emotional desires they are both trying to hide. I have ended up liking every single girl that originally made my stomach fall out when I'd hear about her. (except one...different story)\n\nLet your bf know you should all hang out. Make it a couples thing. You may be even gaining a new friend out of this!  I really think I'm going to I think its a great idea!\n\nI want to wait for a bit before I ask because I don't want him to think I'm still dragging out the issue.

It would make me pretty uncomfortable, too, mainly because he hid it from you.  I feel that if he felt he couldn't be open with you about it up front, then he had some kind of guilty feeling about it.\n I know he was just scared of telling me because of the stereotype. He knows he screwed up and he has apologized for it.\nI truly don't feel that he is doing anything wrong by being friends with her but that doesn't stop how uncomfortable it is.  &gt; I know he was just scared of telling me because of the stereotype\n\nI find this very odd, given you've been together for 4 years. After so long together, I would think he should know you well enough as an individual to base his thinking about how you'd react on the kind of person *he knows you to be* rather than on some stereotypical caricature of 'how girls are'. I'd be pissed if my boyfriend was still treating me a stereotype instead of a person after four years.   \n\nDid he have any reason to think you'd have hit the fan if he'd just been straight with you? Do you have any history of reacting poorly to such things? I mean, it doesn't sound like it, given you said \"I think its utterly ridiculous when girls force their men to stop talking to people of the opposite sex\" (doesn't he know by now that this is your attitude? didn't he know it when he chose to hide this from you?). In other words, was his fear at all grounded in reality or was it just pulled out of his ass and based on some stupid stereotype of 'jealous women'?\n\nHave you asked him how he'd feel if you made a new guy friend you were texting with and kept it from *him*, and how that would make *him* feel? If so, what did he say? If not, maybe you should.  I actually did say that exact thing, and he tells me that he doesn't care who I talk to. \nHe knows how I feel about things, Ive called certain girlfriends of my guy friends crazy for that reason so its very confusing to me why he didn't have faith to tell me.  &gt; why he didn't have faith [in me] to tell me.\n\nThat's what I find most upsetting about this. Have you asked him *that*? Yeah, I actually said that exactly. He just seems upset when we talk about it. Like he knows he fucked up and feels really bad about it. Hes never had a girl \"friend\" since we started dating. Ive always had guy friends, he usually meets them and I tell him all about them. Do you think he \"hid\" it from you (and let's be fair, he was texting right next to you, he didn't put a lock on his phone and leave the room to answer sketchy phone calls) because he was scared you would react like...well like this? With jealousy and sadness at him making a new female friend?

I feel that if he felt he couldn't be open with you about it up front, then he had some kind of guilty feeling about it.\n He probably did feel guilty, but that doesn't mean he did anything wrong. People feel guilty all the time for weird reasons. I think the stereotype is that a lot of women don't want their boyfriends hanging out or talking with other women. The fact that he hid it from her *is* wrong, though. If you're in a loving, trusting relationship with someone, and you're willing to go behind your partner's back just because you think she'll disapprove of a behavior that you want to continue, that's bad news. He probably did feel guilty, but that doesn't mean he did anything wrong. People feel guilty all the time for weird reasons. I think the stereotype is that a lot of women don't want their boyfriends hanging out or talking with other women. People usually don't go through the trouble of hiding conversations if they're about innocent things. Or anything else for that matter.  People do go through the trouble of hiding conversation if they worry that their fiancee is going to have \"nauseating jealous\" feelings if they find out. That's enough to make someone feel guilty about it, even if there's nothing inherently wrong with the discussion. People usually don't go through the trouble of hiding conversations if they're about innocent things. Or anything else for that matter.  You've never heard of people feeling guilty for things they shouldn't feel guilty for? It would make me pretty uncomfortable, too, mainly because he hid it from you.  I feel that if he felt he couldn't be open with you about it up front, then he had some kind of guilty feeling about it.\n I really don't see the problem. He hid it from her because he was figuring out how to tell her. He wasn't lying, he wasn't cheating. He was simply trying to find the best way to tell her this news without freaking her out. Obviously it still has, but that's beside the point (okay, I know that is the whole reason for this post, but its not fair to bring the guy down like this).               \n\nWhat if he hadn't specifically said he hid it from her? I don't know about everyone else, but I don't go running home to my boyfriend to tell him I made a new friend, and he's a guy! This isn't because I don't want him to know or because that friend happens to be a guy. I just don't see the big deal. I don't care if my boyfriend has friends who are girls. Hell, he had more girl friends throughout high school than guy friends. If anything it has taught him to treat me better as a female because of how close he was to them throughout his life. My high school situation was exactly the same (more guy friends than girls), so of course I'm drawn to male friends rather than gals.      \n\nI'm rambling now, but my point is that it is okay. I understand that it makes you uncomfortable, but he **told you.** You both seem extremely happy with your relationship, and from what you said so are the other two. Please do not let something small like this cause any hard feelings toward him or the other girl. Possibly offer for all of you to hang out sometime if you are truly worried about a *slight* possibility of anything funky going on. Body language can tell A LOT. &gt;What if he hadn't specifically said he hid it from her? I don't know about everyone else, but I don't go running home to my boyfriend to tell him I made a new friend, and he's a guy!\n\nBut he did say he hid it from her. He didn't just forget about the texts because they were \"no big deal\", he hid them. He just didn't tell me. He had been tilting his phone from me, and I saw her name pop up. He was sitting right next to me. I got pissed off because when I asked him who he was talking to, he said \"people.\" He just didn't tell me. He had been tilting his phone from me, and I saw her name pop up. He was sitting right next to me. I got pissed off because when I asked him who he was talking to, he said \"people.\" &gt;What if he hadn't specifically said he hid it from her? I don't know about everyone else, but I don't go running home to my boyfriend to tell him I made a new friend, and he's a guy!\n\nBut he did say he hid it from her. He didn't just forget about the texts because they were \"no big deal\", he hid them. Then cue the first part of my response. Why do we have to jump on this guy and assume he wanted to hurt her by hiding the texts?  No one said anything about him wanting to hurt her. If he were open about them, there wouldn't be anything to suspect because he was already being honest. The problem isn't the texting, it's the dishonesty. He still told her, he just didn't know how at first. Hiding something isn't really being dishonest if she didn't ask who he was talking to. I'm not blaming her, I'm not blaming him. I just don't think its a big deal. &gt;What if he hadn't specifically said he hid it from her? I don't know about everyone else, but I don't go running home to my boyfriend to tell him I made a new friend, and he's a guy!\n\nBut he did say he hid it from her. He didn't just forget about the texts because they were \"no big deal\", he hid them. Maybe he was afraid she'd get incredibly jealous... Maybe he was afraid she'd get incredibly jealous... So he gets to blame his hiding things on her, because of her hypothetical reaction to something she didn't even know about. Making this about assigning blame is step 1 to a succesful break-up. He made this about blame when he said he hid it because of how she would react.   How frequently does he text with her? More or less frequently than he texts with his other friends? I feel like if they text every five minutes, that might be a red flag for me. But if they text a couple of times a day or maybe a few times a week, then that sounds completely normal. So, if there's no \"logical\" reason for you to feel this way, you really just need to remind yourself that you're awesome, your relationship is secure (I assume, after 4 years), and that your boyfriend would be such a fucking fool if this were to lead to anything more. Trust your self - I think you will know when/if you have a real reason to worry and if you're just worrying out of insecurity. He texts her more than his other friends and its frequent enough to be weird, but they just started texting about a week and a half ago. I'm kinda hoping they'll run out of stuff to talk to and he'll get bored like he does talking to his other friends.\nHe doesn't warm up to people often so underneath all the jealousy, it makes me happy that hes found a friend and someone to talk to that he has genuinely good conversations with. \nI can't be everything to him at all times, and I know that. We were in a 3 year LDR and so everything is still new to us being around each other all the time.\n\nWe are getting married in two months and our relationship is strong so I'm confident there. If it's \"frequent enough to be weird\" and he hid it from you at first, I'd probably call that a red flag. You should really bring up your concern with him and ask him if there is anything he has to tell you.\n\nThat would make me very nervous, especially since you're getting married soon. It could be a manifestation of one last \"hoorah\" before he's no longer single. Well she knows the girl from hs and she's in a relationship and her boyfriend feels badly about not telling her. They've already talked about it, do you really think asking him if he plans on cheating on her with his new friend is really a good idea to make her seem more secure and less jealous? Apologies aren't a fix-all, nor are they always true. \n\nAlso, this isn't about \"making her seem more secure and less jealous.\" It's about her expressing her concern and having open dialogue about it.\n\nNinja edit: knowing someone from high school means almost nothing, too. People change. Well she said she wants advice on how to get over it and how to not be controlling and jealous, not advice on how to accuse her fiance of plotting to cheat   You aren't his girlfriend - you are his fiancee! You are going to be making the life long commitment of marriage which means you guys need to be able to talk about everything. I think the biggest problem here is that he isn't talking with you about things that bother him, he is talking with another girl about those things.\n\nAlso, hiding it from you seems off somehow. He should be able to trust you fully. There are things called 'emotional affairs' - nothing physical happens between the people involved but they will talk with each other and use it as a way to find an emotional connection with someone new. \n\nHaving friends of the opposite sex is just fine, keeping secrets from your SO about your relationship with those friends is not.      Sorry, but I don't like it. The fact that your fiance hid it from you is a red flag and is completely unacceptable. \n\nI dealt with this same issue a year ago with my ex. It sucks, big time. This was my thinking. My husband's best friend is his ex from high school. I don't mind because he is very open about it. He never hides when he talks to her. In fact, he usually wants to share the conversation. Add to it that she had made an effort to get to know me and he had always made the effort to get to know whoever she is with (and he adores the man she is going to wed this saturday). The openness is what gives me comfort. If he was hiding it, I would worry. Hiding any friendship, regardless of the other person's gender, is worrisome.\n\nSit him down and discuss how it makes you feel and why. Don't be accusatory, but be honest. Let him know that of he had been open from the beginning it would not be an issue. And that his friendship with her is not the issue, but that he felt the need to hide it. That is a breach of trust, which makes things harder than they need to be. Kudos to your husband for being open about it. My ex hid everything from me - the start of his \"friendship\" with a girl was coincidentally the same time that he put a passcode lock on his phone. Questioning him (and the girl) about it resulted in me being told I was paranoid/insecure/etc. My gut was telling me that there was something \"more\" going on, and guess what? I was right.\n\n2Xers, always trust your gut. You know what?  My gut *sucks* at telling me how relationships are going.  Last person I was dating I was daydreaming of kids and got dumped hard.  This one I'm putting my focus really strongly on not being a needy girlfriend because my partner has an important career change coming up. Kudos to your husband for being open about it.

Your ex hid everything, her's hid one thing he thought she'd react poorly to and she (self admittedly) has. Kudos to your husband for being open about it.

The fact that your fiance hid it from you is a red flag and is completely unacceptable. \n\nI dealt with this same issue a year ago with my ex. It sucks, big time.  Been there. The solution, in my case, was just to talk about it. Ultimately, he simply distanced himself *just a little bit* from the female friend. As a result, he still has this fun gal pal, but their friendship stayed at a level of closeness I was more comfortable with. That sounds like the perfect solution for us. I don't want him to lose a friend or think that I'm controlling his interactions. I never want to be the type of girl who tells him what to do.    Red flag. People don't hide things they don't feel bad about. My roommate's boyfriend secretly texts this one girl who is \"just a friend\" about how he loves and misses her. There is no reason he needs to be finding new female friends to talk about things he can't talk to his guy friends about. He has YOU. Maybe it seems controlling, but I would find it strange and EXTREMELY uncomfortable if my boyfriend started texting a new female friend on the regular. Note that this does not include friends he's had for years. So you're saying that a person in a relationship can't make new friends of the opposite sex.\n \n&gt;Maybe it seems controlling.\n \nMaybe? Where did I say a person in a relationship can't make new friends of the opposite sex? Don't put words in my mouth. And yes, there is something strange about her fiance texting a new female friend on a constant basis and trying to hide it from her.  &gt;There is no reason he needs to be finding new female friends to talk about things he can't talk to his guy friends about. He has YOU.\n \nSo he could make a new male friend but not a female friend to talk about his problems.  I'm in an open relationship with my man so he is free to do whatever he pleases. However if he hid something from me he knows how much trouble he would be in.\n\nIn this situation I would sit him down and say its cool to have close female friends. However in this instance you felt the need to conceal this from me which makes me feel that I cannot trust this. I'm calling veto, I don't want you to have anything to do with this woman unless I'm present. You are however welcome to befriend other women and I'll support that. And if I ever find that you've hidden something from me again, our relationship will be over.\n\nIf he cannot be honest with you how does he expect to build a life with you? In my world of open relationships this is our cheating.\n\n I'm in an open relationship with my man so he is free to do whatever he pleases.

And if I ever find that you've hidden something from me again, our relationship will be over.\n\nIf he cannot be honest with you how does he expect to build a life with you? In my world of open relationships this is our cheating.\n\n In your relationship, does he just come out and say \" Im texting a girl, just letting you know\" or \"ive made a new friend that's a girl\" because the only reason I found how was that I saw her name on his phone. He wasnt exactly hiding it from in the normal sense but he didnt jump out and say it. He said he doesn't think he had to tell me everytime he texts someone. I wasn't sure how to respond to that sort of statement.  My man says \"hey babe something's happened. I met a girl her babe is this. This has happened\" \n\nIn our relationship it's full disclosure which means we both tell each other what's happening. Especially whilst establishing new friendships.\n\nWhat your man should have done was say: \nBabe I really think I could be friends with X\nOr\nYou know what happened today X and I started texting.\n\nNo he doesn't need to tell you about every text but he does need to tell you about every new friendship. But if they're just friends why would he need to mention it? I feel like your guy would tell you if he met a lady because your relationship is open to him having other relationships with ladies. Would you really need to know if he JUST made a new friend if it was totally platonic? Absolutely he would tell me because our relationship is based on honest disclosure. I think your situation might be a tad different than hers, though. For you, if he makes a new friend that's a female, it's cool. Even if the thought enters your head that \"hey, this might not be platonic, she's an attractive female\" it wouldn't actually be a big deal because you guys are in an open relationship, as long as he was honest (right?). \n\nNow I'm not saying that him hiding it from her was right, but do you think the fact that she's not okay with him having a female friend is any indication of how she would react were he to be honest with her from the get go? \"Oh, I made a new friend today, it's so-and-so (attractive female).\" His first female friend. Only other girls he speaks to are his girlfriend and his mom and his sister. You don't think she would react poorly to this information?\n\n\"why are you talking to her, why are you texting, why do you need to talk to her...\" when he's just talking to a friend? I'm not trying to justify him hiding it, but it sounds like a slightly different situation than the one that you're in.\n\nHe has NO female friends. He felt uneasy telling his fiance about a new female friend because let's face it, she would probably get jealous. Which she is. Not trying to say it's a good idea to hide it because he should have been up front about it from the get to and addressed any feelings of jealousy (\"this is totally platonic, we are just friends, don't get mad at me\")\n\nbut maybe he was trying to avoid that messy conversation for as long as possible? I hate that I feel like I need to put a disclaimer on this post 3 times but this sub is really sensitive to someone pointing out the other side. NOT SAYING HIDING IT IS THE WAY TO GO but I'm just trying to see it from his perspective I agree with you to an extent.\n\nIt's not ok that he hid this from her and there is no reasonable explanation for this type of deceptive behaviour.\n\nIt's not ok for her to limit his friends. She needs to work on her insecurities that are making her jealous so that she can maintain a healthy relationship. \n\nThey both have work to do, however in this instance I would get rid of the female friend as they have to work on their communication first.\n\nDoes that make my point clear? How do you just \"get rid\" of 'the female friend'? How does she just say \"no, you're not allowed to talk to this girl because it makes me feel jealous sorry no friend for you\" It's called veto. In your relationship, does he just come out and say \" Im texting a girl, just letting you know\" or \"ive made a new friend that's a girl\" because the only reason I found how was that I saw her name on his phone. He wasnt exactly hiding it from in the normal sense but he didnt jump out and say it. He said he doesn't think he had to tell me everytime he texts someone. I wasn't sure how to respond to that sort of statement.   I don't mind my SO being friends with other girls but texting them is another story. I wouldn't like that at all. He wouldn't like it if I was texting guys every day. Being friends is fine, but texting crosses the line for me. I'd ask him to stop texting her.  I'm genuinely curious as to why this is. Do you think that texting tends to be more indicative of hiding something, or is it the frequency/thinking to text someone of the opposite sex throughout the day that you find bothersome? Or am I completely off the mark? The thought of him thinking \"wonder what so and so is doing right now\" instead of maybe texting me or hanging out with me bothers me. Not the my SO ever would though. So you're saying instead of talking to a friend he needs to spend all of his time talking to you? Doesn't that seem a bit unhealthy? It's like you're not giving him the choice to talk to whoever he wants. It's almost as if you're controlling who he gets to talk to.  He can talk to who ever he wants, but if he knows it makes me uncomfortable he probably wouldn't do it.  So basically you're telling him what to do without telling him what to do. Making him feel guilty for paying attention to someone other than you is rather unhealthy.  What do you mean by 'he hid it'?\n\nDo you mean he just didn't mention it until you brought it up, or do you mean he denied talking to her at first? He was texting out of the ordinary sitting next to me on the couch. He was tilting his phone from me, and when I asked who he was talking to he said \"people\" and so i was like ok whatever and that's when I saw her name popup in a message.    Shit, I'd feel the same way.\n\nI feel exactly the same as you in this regard:\n\n&gt;but I CANNOT be the girlfriend who controls her man on who he talks to. I think its utterly ridiculous when girls force their men to stop talking to people of the opposite sex\n\nExactly. Exactly.\n\nYet at the same time, omg this would make me soooo uncomfortable!!! Especially because she isn't a friend that he's always had; she's a new friend that he just made. \n\nYeah, honestly, Idk. I would feel just so so so damn uncomfortable with it. But why? I too trust my BF completely. Yeah, no advice, just sympathy. Idk. The way I look at it is, if I tell him he can't be friends with her than I am being controlling and I would hate for the tables to be turned on me.  I would hate for him to tell me I cannot have guy friends.  I figure, as long as they don't hang out one on one and don't text to frequently than life is good.  You can trust him but still not like it, nothing wrong with it.  As my mom says, 'don't sweat the small stuff' and 'be like a duck, let it roll off you like water', so don't worry when there is nothing to worry about.  ",

    "snippet" : "Just got back from Walmart after primarily going to pick up a prescription refill. I browsed around for a bit while I was waiting for it to fill, like I always do, and I kept seeing some guy in a black jacket darting around and crouching behind displays while staring at me. This happened in several different areas of the store. Sure, it was probably just Loss Prevention making sure I wasn't shoplifting (and absolutely failing at being discreet), but it still put me really ill-at-ease. \n\nLong story short, I realized I don't really know what to do when I suspect someone's following me. I know you're supposed to  stick to very open areas with lots of people, ~~get someone on the phone, and you can prepare to use your keys as weapons~~ EDIT: sarrio made a good point about the phone being distracting and the keys requiring you to get close to them.\n\nAny other tips?  If you're being followed, walk into a public building/place of any kind. Change your route.  Let them know you know they are following you (as in, look at them). Walk confidently. Walk faster if you'd like. \n\nDefinitely do not:\n1) get on your phone - this makes you appear distracted and you are. \n2) use your keys as a weapon - you have to get really really close to someone to hurt them even  a tiny bit with keys. \n\nIn most states it's easy to get pepper spray, which isn't a bad idea. \n\n You can get pepper spray on AMAZON. It's pretty easy to obtain. I keep mine on my keys - hold the pepper spray in hand with the thumb on the trigger, and then keep my car keys between my knuckles just in case. \n\nAlso: Getting my CCW. Just saying. \n\nEdit: Always look a suspicious creep in the eye. Nobody likes a victim that is aware - I can honestly say I've fended of several close encounters this way after getting a close look at someone's face. Don't show fear. &gt;Getting my CCW. Just saying.\n\nMe too! Can I ask what weapon you are going to be carrying? I am still shopping around for one that is small(For easy concealment) but packs a punch. I shot a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Shield 9mm at the range about 2 weeks ago, and I fell in love with it. It's slim and designed for concealed carry. There wasn't too much kick, and it felt very comfortable in my hand and easy to aim.\n\nI know a lot of people LOVE .380 - but I would personally rather go for a 9mm for a carry (slightly larger bullet). Oh, and a 12 gauge shotgun for home defense. As soon as any intruder hears that, there's no way they'll want to come any closer ;)\n\nUnrelated: Dear gun vendors, thank you for acknowledging the fact that women use firearms, but if one more person tries to sell me a pink gun I will probably scream. \n\nThat turned into sort of a rant. Apologies.  [deleted] You can get pepper spray on AMAZON. It's pretty easy to obtain.

I've never been followed in a store, but what I would have done would probably have walked up to him and looked him in the eye, and asked him where the cereal is. He could respond in various ways, like \"I don't work here\", or get skittish that you had the balls to even talk to him. Then I would have talked to a store employee and asked for a security guard to keep an eye on him and walk me to my car.  ",

She considered crossing the street but thought it would provoke them. As they were passing one another, one guy says hi to her and she met his gaze and returned the greeting. Right after they passed, one said to the other, \"lets get her\" and be responded, \"no, she's cool- she said hello!\" And that was it. \n\nI've dealt with many sketchy sorts myself having lived in many shitty places and I believe everyone's just looking for some respect.

As soon as anyone on 2X speaks up about disliking *Girls*, for example, they have to defend themselves :P This contradicts with 17 though--a lot of people hate Girls because they think Hannah is a negative role model, but why does television have to portray positive role models?

As soon as anyone on 2X speaks up about disliking *Girls*, for example, they have to defend themselves :P My problem with number 7 is that a lot of women don't seem to understand the difference between just not liking something and completely tearing it apart. Like, it's one thing to not like Lena Dunham's show, that's whatever. But the nasty comments from women about how she looks and other ridiculous nitpicking need to stop. That's why men don't take us seriously, because we can be so catty sometimes it's hard to tell if we genuinely don't like something or if we're tearing it down because we're being jealous or spiteful (a la Mean Girls). It's *so* easy for someone to just say, \"Hey, I don't particularly care for *Girls*, \" but no it's always, \"Blah blah blah that show sucks, Lena is a *terrible* writer and none of the women are attractive...\" Wow. Cut it out. I wonder if this might be at least partly generational. I've been spending a lot of time with my mom and her sisters lately and can't believe how catty they are. Like, we'd be invited to have dinner at someone's house and they would be pleasant and polite right up until the drive home. Suddenly, the food was blah, did you see what she was wearing, etc etc.\n\nI can't say I've ever experienced that with my friends. In fact, I used to think it was one of those improbable \"women are like this men are like this\" sitcom things, like how we supposedly go nuclear if a man lifts the toilet seat. 15.

With all the recent Chris Brown posts here lately, there have also been the inevitable \"Rhianna is a stupid bitch for staying with him\" posts. It's just been *so* lovely reading all of them.  With all the recent Chris Brown posts here lately, there have also been the inevitable \"Rhianna is a stupid bitch for staying with him\" posts. It's just been *so* lovely reading all of them.  It is very angering to see things like that. So few people understand what happens mentally to a person who is abused, or has a history of being abused. They don't understand that the relationship doesn't start off abusive (for the most part), it starts off like every relationship, with happiness, joy, and maybe eventually love, then it gets abusive. And even fewer people don't understand that when you love or care about somebody, just because they hurt you, there isn't a switch to turn those feelings of love or care off. They still remain there, and even if they hurt you, you still love them. And sometimes it takes being hit and/or hurt to finally see that you don't love them anymore, and if they really loved you then they wouldn't hurt you like that. It is a sad sad terrible thing to happen to a person and it is something that takes a long time to get over and luckily recover from. \n\nPeople that ridicule and shame people who have been abused have absolutely no sympathy and have lived a charmed life. It is disheartening that so many people are like that.  Thank you!\nI'll add one more point, sometimes you love the abuser so much you tell yourself that they only hurt you because odd something you did or said.  They would never have hurt you if you hadn't instigated it.\nPeople who have never been in that situation can't begin to understand the dynamic if the relationship between the abuser &amp; abusee. With all the recent Chris Brown posts here lately, there have also been the inevitable \"Rhianna is a stupid bitch for staying with him\" posts. It's just been *so* lovely reading all of them.  Yeah, and not just \"stupid bitch,\" but \"stupid bitch for whom I have no sympathy and deserves to be mocked and also beaten.\"\n\nI mean there were TONS of 100+ upvoted comments *literally* saying these things. That she DESERVES to be beaten. This is in the recent front page thread with the photo of Chris Brown with Rihanna at the Grammys, where anyone who spoke up against that attitude was downvoted to hell. With all the recent Chris Brown posts here lately, there have also been the inevitable \"Rhianna is a stupid bitch for staying with him\" posts. It's just been *so* lovely reading all of them.  Thank you. We as a public need to scale back mentioning Brown's attack of Rihanna. Although what he did is reprehensible and (I think) unforgivable, whenever you see anything about him it is always \"Chris Brown, who assaulted girlfriend Rihanna in 2009(?)...\" and it's straying into victim shaming which is also horrible. Also, being a violent belligerent is starting to be all he's known for outside his fanbase...and while I for one wouldn't mind him being forced to sew a scarlet \"A\" for abusive asshole on all his clothes, I am profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of someone having celebrity for being a woman-beater. Sorry for the rant. The free paper in my area has a celeb page and they mention Chris Brown all the time.    \nEDIT: I don't know how to spell Rhianna. \nEDIT EDIT: I also don't know how to spell Rihanna, dammit.  I think more people would be willing to forgive and forget if Chris Brown would at least admit he did something wrong.  Like when he won his Grammy or whatever it was.  He wasn't saying, \"I'm really glad people have been able to look beyond my past and give me this second chance and this honor.\"  He said, \"F*** you, haters,\" like a huge douchebag.

He wasn't saying, \"I'm really glad people have been able to look beyond my past and give me this second chance and this honor.\"  He said, \"F*** you, haters,\" like a huge douchebag. Yeah, that guy is still a massive douche and I see no reason to forgive him. Not yet, anyway. I'm just kind of sick of all the shit Rihanna gets. People seem to understand how awful it is to be stuck in an abusive relationship....until it's a celebrity. Then she's dumb cunt who needs to think about all the girls who look up to her. \n\nwat Because the vast majority of women who are \"stuck\" in an abusive relationship are stuck because they have no money, no support group or recourse and/or are afraid the guy will kill them if they leave.  And/or they have kids that are threatened as well.  Rihanna is not stuck, she has chosen to go back to an abusive schmuck.\n\nWhen you have a family (although her father is a douche so maybe that's her excuse/reason) and money and have no need to rely on the abuser, there are no kids to consider and (I think) no fear that the guy is going to kill her....then why would you stay?  \n\nEspecially when there are thousands of young girls who look up to you and revere you and you know, you truly know, that some of those girls are in abusive relationships and will look at your example and think, hey, she's giving a total douche another chance, so I should, too.  Because it's easier that way and they can feel good about staying for a while longer and take the beatings a little longer because, hey if Chris Brown has some redeeming qualities and it's okay to be beaten up, then I should do that.  Because they don't have millions of dollars, or fans or friends or talent or a career to fall back on.  They just have the douche bag and it's scary to stay and scary to leave.\n\nNot every woman has to be a role model to every other woman or girl.  But when you choose to be a celebrity and you know the effect you can have on the lives of so many impressionable girls, then you should take that into account when you make certain choices. \".....then why would you stay?\" \n\nBecause she truly believes that he loves her and that the abuse is her fault, just like every other non-celebrity abuse victim. She has no obligation to be a role model, she's just a person.  \".....then why would you stay?\" \n\nBecause she truly believes that he loves her and that the abuse is her fault, just like every other non-celebrity abuse victim.

But I think that goes for men and women, not just women exclusively.  I don't think celebrities need to go against what they believe or act a certain way for the public, but I do think they need to be wary of how their choices affect those who look to them as an example.  It's like being a parent.  Suddenly all of your irresponsible choices have consequences that affect more people than just you. But why should a woman in the public eye have to represent all women?  Does she also represent everyone of her age, race, height, hair color, weight, marital status, parental status, education, etc.?  That's an awful lot of pressure to put on a person. I think no. 2 has some ground if you've put yourself in the public light.  But I think that goes for men and women, not just women exclusively.

It's like being a parent.  Suddenly all of your irresponsible choices have consequences that affect more people than just you. Yes, but then even as parents, we don't always make the \"right\" choice or the \"best\" choice. We get up and do our best each day, and some days it's better than others.\n\nCelebrities are people trying to live their lives in the way that seems best to them, and sometimes their choices might not be \"right.\"  That's true, which is why there does need to be some room for celebrities to be human (short of excusing them from the law), but that doesn't change the fact that kids and young adults look to them as role models. Yes, and that's why it's up to parents to talk to their kids about these things. In a perfect world, celebrities can all be heroes, but in the real world we can use their flaws and mistakes to open a dialogue about choices and consequences.\n\nMy husband and I had a great conversation with our six-year-old about Lance Armstrong and performance-enhancing drugs and cheating last night. And how, when you cheat, people don't respect you or like you anymore, and how it makes the game not fun.\n\nI really wish the conversation could have been about what a hero Lance Armstrong is, how he overcame cancer to become the world champion of a grueling sport, but, alas, 'twas not to be.

I've noticed that some people feel more comfortable with a guy being bi than being \"totally gay\", like as long as he's \"somewhat heterosexual\" then it's okay. It's like a graduated coming out process. Unfortunately that means that people in the gay community often don't accept people who are bisexual. To ALSO be fair, this is very often the case. That gay men originally come out as bisexual before coming out as completely gay. So while it's not fair to dismiss people who identify as bisexual, I can see why so many people in the gay community are kind of like, \"Give it a rest, just admit you like men already.\" &gt; 4 (bisexual men are considered \"secretly gay\" rather than going through a phase.)\n\nSo bisexual men are secretly gay, and bisexual women are secretly straight.

The core problems of the herd mentality, moralizing, stereotyping, and judgmental shallowness hurt everybody.\n\nThe following apply to men equally:\n\n#3 (virgin-shaming), #21 (sex-work is dirty, sex-workers are evil), #22 (only a certain kind of dating is moral)\n\nThese apply to men, but to a lesser degree than to women:\n\n# 2 (slut-shaming), #5 (superficial judgement based on clothing), #8 (personal worth is relationship status), #18 (everyone should want to marry/procreate), #23 (your sexuality is other people's business)\n\nA couple others have obvious male counterparts:\n\n#4 (bisexual men are considered \"secretly gay\" rather than going through a phase.), #12 (male value in dating is wealth rather than looks), #15 (as far as most of society is concerned men can't be abused), #20 (stay-at-home dads are not considered \"real men\")\n\nWelp, that was depressing. I'm really happy that I can have a personal social network made up of people who are not superficial jerks and I wish I could psychically impose my life experience on every jerk I meet. It really is depressing.  It seems like there are many different \"acceptable\" forms of femininity; a female can be a girly-girl, a tom-boy, a nerdette, etc. - but god help you if don't fit into the \"man's man\" mold of masculinity.  I see so much guy-shaming-guy on reddit alone - if you don't think a certain way, you're dismissed as a pussy.  And I suspect that often the ones doing the shaming don't really believe it themselves - they just don't dare to break the mold for fear of being on the other end of the shaming.  This crap is bad for *everyone*.  Most reddit users are quite young and their attitudes and values are still developing.  Reinforcing a fucked up view of themselves - as well as their attitudes towards women - is bound to cause a lot of problems in the long run. Honestly a couople of these are applicable to men too.

I hate this and the whole idea of \"the friend-zone.\"  I'm sorry, but just because a guy treats me like a decent human being, it doesn't mean he's now entitled to fuck me.

You use it as a term that puts the friendzonee in a bad light, but that person probably uses the same term to put the friendzoner in a bad light. There's also nothing wrong with \"Friendzoning\" someone. It's not like its an insult or negative gesture. If you choose to not want a friendship, that's fine. But there are too many undertones of negativity toward woman who friendzone on reddit. There's also nothing wrong with \"Friendzoning\" someone. It's not like its an insult or negative gesture.

Because I have too many internet points, allow me to suggest that some guys think that women knowingly *take advantage* of \"friendzoned\" guys. Here's the logic:\n\nThe \"friendzone\" is not a normal friendship. A \"friendzoned\" guy almost slavishly worships the woman and will go to extraordinary lengths to meet even her slightest whim. The only reason a guy would subject himself to this is because he is desperate to get with her. This fact is obvious to guys, and it is assumed women must understand this as well. Therefore, when a woman has a guy in the \"friendzone\" she is *reaping the benefits* of his desperation and false hope. In fact, she has less of an incentive to be honest with him that they will never get together. For if he truly gives up hope he will stop doing everything he can to please her and she will lose the benefits of the \"friendship.\"\n\nConversely stated, some guys think that because the woman benefited from the arrangement while knowing that no guy would act so slavishly unless he desperately hoped to get with her, she somehow \"owes\" him sex in exchange. If she didn't want to \"owe\" him anything, she should have sacrificed the benefits of having a \"friendzoned\" guy and told him up front that he had absolutely no chance. \n\nIn other words, the theory goes, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

And that is that.\n\nNeeded to see this :)   #18 I don't want to have it all, *I* want to be a stay at home mum and raise *my* kids.  I have no interest in furthering my career,  just want to be the one who takes care of my kids.  I feel like other woman think this is kind of a \"letting the side down\" thing, or something.  Anyway, I can't, we can't afford it.  It should be all about choice.  Some women think that their choice is best and try to justify why everyone would be happier if they only made the same choices.  Instead, we should respect and support each others' choices and expect the same in return.  Being a mom is fulfilling and rewarding for you and you shouldn't have to justify that to anyone  It might be because I live in a pretty liberal area, but I hear a lot more shaming for women who do have kids or get married younger, then any sort of backlash for choosing to pursue a career or just not wanting kids. \n\nIt seems a lot of people I know consider getting married or having kids to be \"settling\", or just subscribing to traditional gender roles instead of getting what they want out of life. The assumption is that they must be stupid or lazy or being subjugated, completely ignoring the idea that for some wormen, family life and motherhood *is* what they want in life, and there's nothing sad or ignoble about it. \n\nI hardly ever hear the other way around, that a women who doesn't plan on having kids or whatever is somehow deficient. \n\nMy personal experiences may just be different on this one, I suppose, because I do read a lot about those attitudes here on twoX. Hopefully in the future, women will just be able to choose their own path and no one will try to shame or judge them either way.   &gt;18. There are certain things that women should inherently want out of life, such as marriage and having children, and if you do not want those things there is something defective about you.\n\nTHIS. A million times. I don't want to get married or make babies. I want a career and I want to fucking rock at my career. It is so hard to get people to understand this!!  I am glad someone finally mentioned the one about sex work. I am sick and freaking tired of all the bagging on people in the sex industry.

I met interesting people, I had good times and bad times, I made a lot of damned money and I also got a lot shit from people over it.

As someone who was naturally extremely thin for most of her life, I understand the negativity that thin women often receive. But I haven't taken the phrase \"real women have curves\" to mean that I was not a real woman - only that the photoshopped images of women in magazines are not indicative of real women and perhaps that the women who actually fit that ideal image are not representative of most of the population.

There are certain choices we can make in life which are inherently more feminist than others, such as choosing to delay family life in order to have a high-powered career.\n\nThis one bugs me a lot, and it's not easily solved as everyone reinforces it.\n\nIf I don't want a crazy career, then I'm both unintelligent and not a great enlightened woman.  If I, on top of that, chose to be a homemaker, then I'm just a slave to the old system! Still stuck in the mires of the patriarchy! \n\nI love the opportunities of going to school and being the next female president or anything I want.  I am just upset that we made the opportunity to be a homemaker a lot harder, and that we stigmatized it so heavily. Let me be free, damn it.   How is 22. a lie?  Surely there are better and worse ways to go about dating, having sex and meeting people? (Well maybe not the last one).  For instance, cheating on people vs not cheating on people.  Maybe I'm just misunderstanding this?  &gt;5. There is a direct correlation between the kind of clothes you wear and the amount of respect you deserve.\n\nThis is told to males and females alike.

The way I dress gives me the power to frame the way people are likely to deal with me before they even meet me.\n\nAs everyone knows, I wont get the VP job if I wear shorts and a tank to the interview.  If I'm dressed and kept like a hobo, I'll probably be given the respect that people give a hobo.\n\n I think they're more talking about 'slut shaming' women who show skin.  You shouldn't judge a woman based on how much skin she's showing, whether she's in daisy dukes or a burqa.  There is a time and a place for all clothes.  Business casual for an interview, dress at a fancy party, hats when you go into certain religious institutions, etc.  But your casual clothes should never be judged. I agree, I think the implication here is how people will judge you based on your clothing in terms of your *own* self respect and your sexuality. \n\nIt's not like I don't think that people should dress \"appropriately\" for a certain social situation. I just think that like many things, it's an easy mental shortcut to take to pass judgment, often it's the first thing that triggers such judgment. \n\nFor instance, there is an extremely arbitrary line between what people will call \"sexy\" and \"slutty.\" Additionally, contexts are what define \"appropriateness\", yet this is what makes them arbitrary. A woman in a bikini at the beach is not automatically slut per se - now there's a new set of rules to judge her. On the street, it's \"is her cleavage showing?\" \"why is she wearing leggings as pants?\" \"those shorts are too short.\"  I think they're more talking about 'slut shaming' women who show skin.

    "title" : "Ladies, I need some questions answered about ear piercing!",
    "snippet" : "So here's a little background: I'm 22 years old, and I've had my ears pierced about 4 times in my life, always at least 5 years in between each time. Every single time, they seem to get infected and close up, no matter what I do, no matter what type of metal I put in my ears. I've always had it done at Claire's, or some such places in the mall. \n\nSo here's my question: Should I just give up and deal with the fact that my ears are so sensitive that they just won't accept earrings of any kind, or is there something I'm totally missing? \n\nI've heard some of my friends say that I need to go to someone who specializes in piercings, maybe a tattoo/pierce shop? I would just really like to try one more time, but if it's totally inadvisable, then I can deal with that. I just need some advice I can count on by someone who knows what they're talking about.   [reasons not to use a gun](http://jewelry.about.com/od/bodyjewelry/a/piercing_guns.htm)  [reasons not to use a gun](http://jewelry.about.com/od/bodyjewelry/a/piercing_guns.htm)   Never get anything pierced with a gun! You should not take out a piercing just because it is infected- you lock in the infection. If you try again, go to a real piercer with sterile needles and jewelry.    Are they getting infected with the jewelry still in? Or are you taking the earring out? You shouldn't for several weeks. I think for earlobe piercings you're only supposed to twirl the earring and clean with a q tip.\n\nIf you want to try again, I would definitely go to a piercing shop. Get a surgical stainless steel earring. For aftercare soak the piercing in warm water mixed with sea salt.  I would suggest discussing it with a reputable body piercer. Ask around for a good local person. \n\nTotally agree withe everyone that you should not use a gun. While mine were done with a gun many years ago, I would not do that now that I know better. \n\nYou mentioned that you react to the piercing often within a couple of hours. That seems really quick to me. I would guess that either your body doesn't deal well with foreign objects, or (more likely IMHO) you are reacting to the metal used. If I wear crappy earrings in my very established holes, they will itch and get infected in about 2 hours. If I use silver, surgical steel or gold then I'm fine. I understand though that other people will still react to some of these metals. Again, talk to a piercer who knows their stuff and can give you a good evaluation if it's worth getting another piercing and the proper treatment of the wound to avoid infection.  Yes, I'll try a few local places that do more professional piercings, seeings as how it seems that most metals don't do well with me. Crossing my fingers that this will work! Thanks :)    No gun, huh? Alright, so if I do get an infection, I just wait it out and treat it, but don't take the jewelry out?  Right! What made you think it was infected?  My whole ear (almost) would turn red and it seemed like around the piercing, there would be buildup, even a few hours later. Is this normal? I mean, the last time I pierced, I was 16 or 17 and from what I remember, the pain seemed tremendous, and I'm not usually very intolerant to pain. That happened to me twice, once with a regular cartilage piercing (gun) and once with my industrial (needle). Clean your piercing well and contact your piercer if it gets infected and you start noticing a fever, etc. You might have to go to the doctor for some antibiotics. Besides that, ride it out and DON'T TAKE THE PIERCING OUT. My industrial took about a year to heal completely in total. Wow, really? So then that's my problem right there, I didn't wait very long before I would just take the earring out and give up.  When you take out the earring while the infection is there, you're locking it in instead of letting it heal. I took out the cartilage one and my ear now has a permanent bump (almost 10 years later). Makes sense. My ears still have little bumps in them that I can feel.  They won't go away but it's no big deal. Check out /r/piercing, it's a pretty cool community with lots of knowledgeable people. My whole ear (almost) would turn red and it seemed like around the piercing, there would be buildup, even a few hours later. Is this normal? I mean, the last time I pierced, I was 16 or 17 and from what I remember, the pain seemed tremendous, and I'm not usually very intolerant to pain. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help with the redness &amp; pain. It shouldn't be painful, unless you catch your hair on it or hit it. What kind of aftercare routine did you have? I would use the alcohol (or whatever cleaner it was) that they gave me and rub around the earring, front and back, with a q-tip once a day, usually in the morning.   Alcohol is terrible for piercings, it [kills live tissue](http://www.inksplosive.com/index.php/aftercare/piercing-aftercare). Sea salt is the best thing you can use. Ok, so basically, I've done everything wrong each time. Haha ;)\nThanks so much for the advice. I'm definitely going to try again with a professional.  Good luck! Every time I've gotten a piercing (MANY different shops) they've always supplied aftercare instructions and a small amount of sea salt. You can always buy sea salt at the grocery store, but be sure to [dilute it](http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Salt_Soaks).

Alright, so if I do get an infection, I just wait it out and treat it, but don't take the jewelry out?  ",

I just wanted a nice 21st birthday and my body couldn't let that happen. I just want to be happy. That's all I want in life and it's harder than anything due to my stupid internal chemistry. As if the crippling pain I'm going to likely get tomorrow or the next day isn't enough, my body has to go and make me miserable on top of it. I'm so sick and tired of pushing through the physical and emotional pain every single month. It's just a normal bodily function. Why doesn't it work like the circulatory system or breathing or some other system that doesn't make me wish I were dead on a monthly basis? I'm otherwise perfectly healthy and in good shape. I take vitamins every day and get plenty of sunlight. Arghhhh &lt;\\end rant&gt;.\n\nI guess I should be thankful that the medication I'm on prevents me from feeling terrible all the time.  \n\nAnyone got any tips for dealing with this?   ",

    "snippet" : "I hate using pads, but dealing with some issues, I can't put anything up inside my vag, so I have to use pads again. IME they always slip, wedge up somewhere, feel like a diaper, etc. Pretty heavy flow so I don't have the option of just wearing a liner. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on pads to use? And how to figure out which way is supposed to go front and back? \n\nThanks :)  I prefer cloth pads. I think they stay put better. But it does not totally eliminate the wedging or diaper feel though. I think it's the unfortunate natural effect of having to add a high absorbent barrier layer, such as a pad. I do notice you get used to it over time.\n\nThere is every kind of pad imaginable on etsy. But I prefer something with wings and in various sizes, like [in this listing](http://www.etsy.com/listing/69031619/) or [these](http://www.etsy.com/shop/LillyaPads?ref=seller_info) or [these](http://www.etsy.com/shop/HomesteadEmporium?ref=seller_info). You can find ones that appeal to you and try them out. What do you do when you need to change the pad in the middle of the day? Like at school?  I like the Always ones for heavy flow. They don't really have any plastic parts on them so they don't make noise are are more comfortable plus they have the wings so I've never had an issue with them moving about. And now that you've mentioned it I've never thought about which way is front or back. I think most are universal.  Those are the ones I use right now. They feel a bit too wide. Like I have a platypus tail slapping my bum.  Try Always Infinity. They're thinner than regular Always, absorb more, and you never feel it until it's time to change. I swear by those pads.

I respect your right to squat, but making such a mess in a public place is unacceptable. \n\nLong story short, can't we all just be grown-ups, sit on toilet seats, and wash our hands afterwards?   I was in China for two years and had to live with the squattie.  Here are my problems with it:\n\nThe smell.  There's going to be some splash.  You're dropping a liquid from a height with no barrier to hold the splash at bay, so your ankles always have a little pee on them.  Gross.  Also, it gets on the tile, the bathrooms might only be cleaned once or twice a day and it **just stinks**.  \n\nEasy to fall in.  Seriously, if you're not used to them or you're wearing heels, it's easy to slip and now you're sitting in your own mess.\n\nWearing tights or a skirt makes things difficult because you have to always be holding them out of the way while balancing.\n\nAnd what if you need to take a moment to sit down or if you want to drop a deuce?  Sometimes things take a little bit of.. um... concentration, which can be difficult on a squattie.  Oh god, I can't believe they are actually suggesting these. I have used a squat toilet exactly one time before, completely sober, I... just can't. I refuse to do this again. It's extremely uncomfortable and awkward to have to squat like that, even being in good physical shape. \n\nTo someone who is a fan of these... could you explain to me the positive attributes of a squat toilet? I'm just not seeing any.\n\nI have an awesome idea for the \"dirty toilet seat\" problem, boss of Bardo... CLEAN THEM MORE OFTEN. &gt; To someone who is a fan of these... could you explain to me the positive attributes of a squat toilet? I'm just not seeing any.\n\nI'm not specifically a fan but there's the fact that squatting is physiologically the best position to get urine out of your bladder.\n\nSuppose you could count it against squat toilets that we're not culturally used to them, but that doesn't make it objectively worse. If you compare the two with other things being equal, say, a Japanese person with her squat toilet and you with our western toilet, you're both perfectly comfortable using the toilet you have, the difference then being that the Japanese person comes out of the toilet with an emptier bladder than you. Oh god, I can't believe they are actually suggesting these. I have used a squat toilet exactly one time before, completely sober, I... just can't. I refuse to do this again.

Sure there might be a bit of a learning curve for some folks, but squat toilets aren't nearly that daunting.  Using one in heels and tights isn't that different from how you'd use it wearing pants. If you can stand and walk in heels, surely you can squat?  \n\nAs for the smell, in my experience, I've seen squat toilet bathrooms cover the spectrum from foul to immaculate, which is exactly the same thing you could say for public bathrooms with Western-style toilets anywhere else.  \n\nI don't know, they can be intimidating the first few times you encounter them, but using one really isn't that big of a deal. \n   Por que no los dos? http://www.pinz.com.sg/wc/home.html   ",

    "snippet" : "Hello TwoX, it's starting to get a bit warmer here for the time being, and I can't wait until the spring and summer. I need some advice concerning my legs. I use a Venis Embrace razor and shaving cream, but my hair grows back really fast like, within a day. Stubble is noticeable but since switching to the Embrace I don't get TOO many red bumps anymore. My legs are also extremely pale and no matter how much time I spend outside, the rest of my body is SIGNIFICANTLY tanner while my legs are still white as a ghost! I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong but I've always had problems with my legs. I'm a 19-year-old girl for reference. I love walking around my university campus wearing skirts or capris but I can't help but be self conscious about my legs.   Regarding stubble:  have you looked into using an [epilator](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=234944011)? So much cheaper than waxing, with comparable results. Looks...terrifying. I guess I'll have to do some research on that  I have severe eczema covering my legs from high thigh to mid calf as well as very sensitive skin.  I used to be really self conscious but I honestly got over it.  If the worst if your skin problems is pale legs and some red bumps I would say you are doing great!  I also have very pale skin but I embrace it (and I think you should too).  Sun is healthy for you but in moderation too much and well...I'm sure you know the whole skin cancer/sun poisoning thing.  Work on shaving with a men's razor they are better and shaves can last longer.  Also don't use things like scented soap/shaving gel or lotion.  Lotions that have perfumes in it can irritate your skin more and make rashes, red bumps and other blemishes more pronounced.   Have you ever tried Nair or Veet? I have really course, dark leg hair and my legs only stay smooth for a day or so, then within a few days I have dark stubble again. When I know I need my legs to stay smooth and won't have time to shave every other day, I use Nair or Veet and they've both worked really well for me. My skin is mildly sensitive, but neither product has bothered my legs.  I tried Nair a few times and it didn't do anything...I suppose I can try again!      For red bumps, do you apply lotion after shaving? I started liberally applying lotion to my legs right after getting out of the shower (while they're still damp with water), and haven't had an issue with red bumps since then.     This might be an unpopular opinion, but as someone with extremely pale skin who used to have very black, coarse, fast growing hair (and very visible follicles no matter what), I say get it lasered off. It was the only thing that worked for me. PM me if you want more info.",

    "title" : "Something I realized about my own self worth, relating to my career",
    "snippet" : "Hello lovely ladies (and gents). I wanted to share with you a big realization I had recently that sort of ties in with that \"24 lies women are told\" post, which I thought was really excellent.\n\nSince I was in high school, I have put a tremendous amount of pressure on myself as far as my career. I've always been good at science and math and because of this I believed that I was obligated to work in a technical field. I got a degree in engineering and hated every minute of it. I was deeply depressed because I didn't enjoy what I was doing but I felt like there was no way out. I thought I had to have a big, fancy, technical job and make a lot of money or else I would be a failure. I ignored the fact that the only job I've ever truly enjoyed was teaching high schoolers music. I get so much joy out of playing, writing, and teaching music but I thought I couldn't possibly make a career out of this because I wouldn't have a lot of money and I wouldn't have an \"impressive\" job title. To me, I was personally obligated to demonstrate that women can be successful engineers, no matter the cost to my happiness.\n\nWell, a friend of mine heard me say all of this and asked me why the hell I place all of my self worth in my career choice. I realized that no one was putting pressure on me but myself, and that no one really cared about my job as an indicator of how good or impressive I am. While I was wasting time stressing about how I was going to get this high-profile career going, I forgot about the things that ACTUALLY define me - the way I treat people, my talents, my relationships, my passions. He also wanted to know why I looked down on non-STEM jobs so much. I realized that I was not only putting myself down for wanting a job in a creative area, but I was being extremely judgmental towards all women who choose non-STEM paths or even staying at home. This whole thing made me see that my actions did not define all women, and I remembered that the whole basis of feminism is choice, not a specific path that you must take to be a \"true\" feminist.\n\nI'm writing this post in hopes that anyone else who is putting unreasonable pressure on themselves will see what I've seen: that what really matters is choosing to do what makes you happy. I've realized that I was not only destroying my own self-worth, but I was being pretty freaking shallow towards myself and others. I'm so thankful to my friend for helping me see this and I really feel like I have a new outlook on life.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear your experiences with figuring out what you want to do with your life and how that aligns with your ideals as a woman. Have you felt pressure to have a certain type of career, or experienced opposition at your choices? Was it brought on by yourself or others?   I would say I have had the opposite experience. Personally, I have absolutely 0 inclination to have any sort of stressful job, don't want long hours, don't want to ever feel like I have to bring work home with me... but I have had a lot of pressure put on me by my family to have a successful (meaning I get paid a lot) career. For example in high school I wanted to go to nursing school, and all I ever heard was \"Why don't you go to medical school???\" \"But don't you want to be a doctor?!\" \"Nurses don't make a lot of money, you should be a doctor\". Thanks for being so supportive mom and dad...\n\nMoving onto college, I had my major as biology while still hoping to go to nursing school. Honestly, I hated pretty much all the science courses (chem, bio 1) except for Bio 2 which was more focused on the human body, which I found interesting. The classes I was loving were things like sociology, psychology, and growth and development (another psych related class). But all I ever heard was sociology/psychology majors were for stupid people, usually those on the sports scholarships who needed an easy major to do while going pro for sports. \n\nFinally this last year I decided to stop lying to myself about being good at science (although I still find medicine fascinating) and stop letting others pressure me into doing more than I want to do. I know I can be happy without making a lot of money, I've been doing it since I was 18 and I can do it now. Big houses take too long to clean anyways! What I really like to do is talking with other people and helping them, so now I am focused on going back to school for counseling. \n\nBasically TL;DR learn to not give a fuck what other people think you should do. &gt;For example in high school I wanted to go to nursing school, and all I ever heard was \"Why don't you go to medical school???\" \"But don't you want to be a doctor?!\" \"Nurses don't make a lot of money, you should be a doctor\". Thanks for being so supportive mom and dad...\n\nThis is the exact thing I have heard from my family my entire life (if you replace nursing with EMS/firefighting). \"You should be a doctor, they make better money and you're too smart to be a paramedic.\" \n\nBut I am *happy* being an EMT and firefighter. I think I could spend my whole life working in emergency services and be content.\n\nI am not cut out for medical school. It isn't for my personality. I am a smart, driven person but I don't want to spend the remainder of my youth buried in textbooks.   Thanks for sharing. It's frightening how easy it is to forget those things that truly define us...\n&gt;the things that ACTUALLY define me - the way I treat people, my talents, my relationships, my passions\n\nEvery time I remember my values and try and see if I'm living according to them it's like a breath of fresh air and some of the pressure lifts.\n\n\nAre you in the US? I feel that there is a culture here of job=success rather living a good life =success but I don't know anything about other countries.     I'm at a similar crossroad in my life. I'm about to graduate with an MBA I don't want on top of a bachelor's in business administration that I didn't want, because that was the only path that was acceptable to my verbally abusive dad once he realized that my math and science skills would never be good enough for a STEM career. I still feel a lot of shame that I couldn't make myself more interested in those subjects and that my talents fell toward \"useless\" \"feminine\" subjects like art and English. My parents really wanted me to be a career woman in a male-dominated field, and for the longest time I felt like I had failed everyone, especially myself, for not doing that. \n\nPoint being, I've come to a lot of realizations lately. My dad was always very critical of my art and writing, and tore my work down every chance he could. It destroyed my confidence in my abilities and career prospects so that I felt like I had no choice but to accept the path he wanted for me. And now that I've realized these things, I worry that it's too late to live there life I want. I don't get support from my family, and I don't have a SO to lean on emotionally or financially while I figure my life out. I'm going to be stuck, alone, in a bourgeois business world full of meaningless buzzwords and pantyhose, and all because I couldn't grow the ovaries to stand up for myself and my dreams. \n\nI'm sorry that this is only tangential to your original post, but I have a lot of feelings and I recently had to stop therapy because I couldn't afford it anymore, so you all get to hear about my daddy issues. I guess I'm just glad that I'm not alone with these kinds of feelings?  The good thing is, you can do a ton with a business degree! You gain so much knowledge about how companies work, what motivates people, how to understand financial reports, etc. That enables you to be soooo flexible in your career - you can practically work at any company and learn the hard skills when you get the job. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, just because you have business degrees that doesn't mean you have to be a manager or business owner. Go help run a nonprofit. A coffee shop. Work as a consultant. Do tech writing. Etc. I have an MBA and i work as a sr consultant at a software company, helping customers improve their business processes and go paperless. I get to travel all over the place, meet a ton of people, and generally afford my hobbies. There is so much creativity in this job, I love it. I've met some wonderful people, even one of my best friends. \n\nAnyway... Point is, you have gained a broad and extremely useful set of skills - be creative in using them! :-)  How did you decide to get an MBA, and how did you end up being a consultant?  I was working as a Sales Engineer for a software company (after working in tech support for 1.5 years) and found that I didn't really understand how businesses worked. I didn't understand finance either (in my undergrad, I had studied math &amp; comp sci, then switched to international relations). I wanted to change that, and knew I needed to gain that knowledge if I wanted to continue my career upward.\n\nI looked into a 2nd undergrad in biz, but my adviser recommended an MBA. It was perfect, everything I needed and wanted.\n\nI quit the other company, worked as a team lead for an insurance company 1.5 years and hated it. I then took a consulting job with a different software company. Did that for 3 years before getting promoted to Solution Architect - basically a senior senior consultant who focuses on both the sales side of our professional services (writing scope documents, talking to customers about requirements, etc) and the best-practices/mentoring side of our consulting shop. I actually just got promoted to lead SA in our dept about 8 months ago. I'm 37f, FWIW.\n\nYou could look into consulting firms - E&amp;Y, Deloitte, Accenture, KPMG, etc... or, you could look at companies in your area who hire consultants or business analysts (most larger companies will have teams that work on internal projects). I've found that getting into generalized consulting has presented me with a LOT of career options. I've just needed to add a solid work ethic, a lot of drive/motivation, and a friendly personality. :)\n\nAMA! ;) Thank you for the detailed response! I'm getting close to graduating with a double major in Environmental Science and Spanish and I'm thinking about getting an MBA as opposed to getting a grad degree in a science field, since they seem to have a much broader application in the \"real world\" (outside academia, since I'm not interested in researching or becoming a professor) I'm at a similar crossroad in my life. I'm about to graduate with an MBA I don't want on top of a bachelor's in business administration that I didn't want, because that was the only path that was acceptable to my verbally abusive dad once he realized that my math and science skills would never be good enough for a STEM career.

    "snippet" : "Our story feels a million miles long. I'm half baked and writing this through tears. We dated for 3.5 years before he broke up with me in the beginning of October saying he felt a difference in our relationship and he wanted out. We met up a few times from then until the end of December talking things out, and I admitted to him in one of these conversations that I had just started to accept and get really excited for the idea of having kids with him (I had never been able to give him a straight answer in the past which led to basically the only strain on our relationship... Or I guess the only one I thought we had?) Well he is floored by this and says it had been the initial catalyst in him wanting to break up with me in the first place. We got back together, knowing that our relationship had been weakened but that he’d made a mistake and we should work to talk through problems/feelings and fix things in the future. \n\nSince October we have been living several hours apart from one another. Initially he was staying with his parents, but he decide to enroll in a Masters program on the southern end of my state and has been there since the beginning of January. I work a 9-5 so we saw each other on weekends. Neither of us are big phone-talkers so we would sparsely text throughout the day for most of our conversations. Weekends together had been blissful. He studied a bit but our sex life was better than it had been for a long time. I feel like adding that he has Aspergers/ASD is relevant to a lot of his behaviors personally and in our relationship. Or it is how I learned to understand his differences.\n\nFast forward to tonight. I texted him around 6 asking for a call, since we hadn’t talked much in the last few days. He calls around 7, opens with “You will eventually hear this from someone else so you might as well hear it from me.” Struggles to get a point out for a minute, then eventually says. “You’re going to hate me. I’m breaking up with you and I’m going to start dating someone else.”\n\nI am floored. Dumbfounded. I called his mom because we are so close and mine didn’t answer. My high really starting kicking in about ten minutes ago and I’m really fucking sad. Sad at how disrespected I feel, and how much I’ll miss his family. And sad that he did this because I know I will never give him another chance for treating me like this.  You're going to be Ok. This guy hasn't been treating you well for a long time now. \n\nBreaking up a long-term relationship is like taking off a band-aid. Rip it off quickly. It'll hurt like hell, but if it was peeled off more slowly it would have been torture.\n\nYou now have the opportunity to heal and move on to find someone who will treat you like you want to be treated. :) Thank you for your words. I just feel so disrespected right now. He put me through this once before so I know how to live and thrive without him. But at the same time I have low self-esteem already and him being with someone else so quick makes me feel pretty shitty and inadequate.  If it's any consolation, the fact that he's \"moved on\" so quickly kind of makes it clear that he wasn't the nicest chap on the face of the planet. It's a jerk move to dump someone and start dating someone else right away. Especially considering the timing. \n\nI kind of feel sorry for this new person, whoever they are. I doubt that they know that he was seeing someone when he started expressing an interest in them. Relationships that start off where the last one ended on a wrong to another person, usually aren't going to turn out so peachy. \n\nYou have been terribly disrespected. It'll hurt, and your heart is going to ache. But please remember that you weren't disrespected because something is wrong with you - there's something obviously wrong with him to treat you so badly. \n\nTake some time to do some good things for yourself. You've been set free. {{ hugs }}  You can do it! You're going to be okay. It's going to hurt, but you're going to make it!\n Thank you! Happy cake day! I wish I could accelerate the hurt part. After doing this once before I don't want to waste my sadness on someone who obviously did not have my best interests at heart.",

    "snippet" : "I don't know what to do. I'm 20 years old at an expensive college that I commute to on a daily basis. When I got out of high school a mixture of being anxious about leaving the area and my parents insisting they can't afford to send me off to school made me decide to commute. Mind you, this makes it SO much harder to try to make friends. I'm in my third year of a five year program, so I have 2 more years before I am done and can just get a job. In the meantime, I am literally going insane with my parents, particularly my mother. They complain I'm never home, but I'm delicately balancing school, work, the little bit of a social life I've clung to, and a boyfriend who loves me dearly. It doesn't help that even in the mornings now my mom decides to speak to me as little as physically possible. \n\nI'm borderline depressed at this point. They always tell me how extremely selfish I am to want to go out with my friends or how I don't care about them because I want to see my boyfriend. Every time my mom DOES talk to me and it isn't her angry at me for something, all she does is talk about herself and all of her accomplishments. Mind you, she takes putting ice on someones knee and turns it into she's superwoman who knows more than any doctor but CHOSE not be one. \n\nEither way, I try to explain to her the stress of college, and she'll insist she knows because she went to college, too. She did one year of art school. That's NOT the same as 3 years in an intense science program, I'm sorry. I get good grades, and that takes SO MUCH WORK. She's unemployed so they don't pay for really anything to help me, either. She crashed our family's credit a few years ago and now they can't even co-sign my loans. The ONE loan they took for my freshman year is CONSTANTLY held over my head. \n\nAfter my mom was caught flirting with another guy on facebook, my dad has gone on a quest to save his marriage. Basically, this means he supports EVERY complaint she has and tries to pacify her to be a \"good husband.\" I can't do this anymore. I can't deal with being told I'm selfish because I spend my time trying to keep up with my life, I'm tired of being told I'm inconsiderate because I at 20 years old don't text her when I arrive at every destination (mind you, I'll have told her where I'm going, she's just paranoid I got in a car accident on the way), I'm tired of all of my accomplishments like making my college's deans list being demoted to \"you should've been getting those grades already\", and I'm tired of living in my house. I have to get out of here, but with a 40,000/year tuition I just can't. I understand my mom has mental illnesses (bipolar and depression), but I can't keep using that as an excuse. Please, anyone, is there something I can do?\n\nTL;DR: My parents (particularly my mother) constantly put me down and make me feel awful. I have 2 more years of college, and I can't afford to leave. Living here is KILLING me, what do I do?              ",

    "snippet" : "Every Wednesday, I participate in a water aerobics class. Every week, in hopes of losing the many pounds I need to, I push myself as hard as I can. Every week, as I feel good about myself, I look at the large woman in the front of the class and think nasty thoughts. Why did she let herself get so big? Why doesn't she come every week? Can't she work any harder? At least I'm not that fat. \nAs a heavy woman, I know how it hurts for other people to see me that way. I know that I have made choices to get where I am. Yet, somehow, I felt no remorse thinking that way about someone else. \nUntil today. \nToday, after class, we got to talking about our plans for the rest of the day. \"C\" mentioned how she had to go shopping. We talked about Lane Bryant and Catherine's, both plus size stores. \"C\" told me that last year, she was a size 18, the same size I am  now. After being diagnosed with cancer, she began an aggressive treatment, including chemo and steroids. \"C\" gained 150 pounds in the last year. She is also winning the battle against cancer. \n\"C\" did make choices to get where she is. \"C\" chose to fight cancer as hard as she can. She chose to stop caring what others thought of her body. She chose to love life and love herself regardless of the negatives. \nI feel like a jerk, having judged \"C\" based on how she looks. I had no idea what she is going through and how hard she is working. I might be fighting hard to lose weight, but \"C\" is fight a lot harder, for her life.    ",

I won't know the diagnosis, but the doctor took one look and said \"I'm going to go ahead and start you on herpes medication.\" \n\n\nI guess now I have to inform the guy I got it from- who told me he was clean. Honestly, he might not have known, or he might have thought that HSV-1 (oral herpes) wasn't transferable through oral sex. \n\n\nI'm oscillating on a spectrum of feeling throroughy worthless/unclean and being rational about it. It's still very surreal. I'm going to have to caveat emptor my sex life from here on out. I'm going to have to get used to more frequent and emotionally scarring rejections. \n\nI just need to vent. I need stories of how you rose above the stigma of having herpes, especially since the stigma is particularly prevelant in the United States.\n\nGive me your survival/thrival tips: how do you go about informing new partners/old partners? How do you deal with outbreaks? How do you deal?\n\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do.   ",
