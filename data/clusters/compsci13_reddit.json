    "snippet" : "I'm not sure how to conduct a benchmark of software or algorithms that are implemented in an application properly. Is there a particular methodology I can follow or does anyone know of a paper that's a great example of benchmarking or that can explain how to do it properly?  It depends on your particular algorithm.  Speed (often in operations per second) is the most general benchmark, but depending on the type of algorithm you're implementing, you might also want to test output correctness and precision (for algorithms that may not always provide the same output given a certain input, like Monte Carlo algorithms).\n\nAlways do everything on the same hardware, but that goes without saying.  Provide your testing code for the world to see too.  I'm always iffy whenever I see people compare different algorithms and not provide the actual code to back it up.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nteawreckshero and ReshenKusaga are correct, you should always do Big-O and other theoretical analysis of your algorithm first.  Benchmarks for speed are mostly for software development in different environments, such as different browsers. Cool thanks for the answer! How useful is it to replicate other people's benchmarks (even if they're flawed)? Cool thanks for the answer! How useful is it to replicate other people's benchmarks (even if they're flawed)? Unit testing is for making sure it's correct. Big O analysis is for measuring efficiency and scalability.\n\nclarle mentions operations per second....I'm not sure how this is relevant as it will vary on different hardware. Ops/sec would be useful for actually testing the hardware (like an actual cpu or something), but it's arbitrary when it comes to running code. No one is going to want your results presented in the form, \"my algorithm had ___ operations in one second on ___ hardware\". Doesn't do them any good when translating to other hardware. Big O, however, gives a much better idea of the limits of your algorithm. Unit testing is for making sure it's correct.

Big O, however, gives a much better idea of the limits of your algorithm. I don't know, maybe some of those specific results would be useful for at least giving an estimate?  Also, actual tested data is likely taking place in an OS that has full control over thread switching which cannot be predicted or accounted for. If you're trying to time something, odds are you will also be including other threads that have nothing to do with your program as well. There are too many variables.\n\nExample:\n\nstartTimer() -&gt;\nbeginAlgorithm() -&gt; Context Switches interleaved into process total 2 sec -&gt; algorithm Returns with 100 completed in 10 sec \"operations\"\n\nResult: 100 ops/10 sec. Actual time is 100 ops/8 sec, but you have no way of measuring that 2 sec and it will never be consistent.

Actual time is 100 ops/8 sec, but you have no way of measuring that 2 sec and it will never be consistent. I don't quite agree. Firstly it's possible to set the priority/affinity of a process to avoid context switches. Secondly, your testing environment should always be fresh and controlled, such that it's possible to replicate. You want to prove that your analysis is correct and applies to the real world, otherwise they're purely theoretical and never used outside academia. Even for purely theoretical datastructures, such as van Emde Boas trees, you want to do a test on real hardware. As long as it's a pre-emptive OS you will not be getting accurate results. For instance, redrawing the screen and getting input from the keyboard/mouse always take priority no matter how high you set the affinity. And these are just the most obvious threads.\n\nTo you second point, you are right. I kind of steered to the side of the main question which was in reference to benchmarking software, not just the algorithms behind it. So yes, obviously you must show how it performs empirically, not just theoretically. But keeping my original point in mind, this would always test the implementation more than the algorithms.   CS:APP had a good section on how to properly benchmark, though I don't remember the details of it. CS:APP is what?    ",

    "snippet" : "I doubt this is the right place to ask, but I have always wanted to know just how hard it would be for a company (assuming they had access to the designs) to just manufacture classic videogame consoles, like the N64 or Gameboy, so instead of emulating the games, they actually run it on real hardware, exactly the same as the originals).\n\nIs this even possible, or are these old processors lost to history, becoming forever unfeasible to produce again? Or would it actually not be too much of a problem, like if a firm in China knew they could sell at least 10,000 units, would it not be too much trouble to recreate old gaming hardware that runs *exactly* the same as we all experienced it in our childhoods?\n\nAny interesting insight anyone has to anything relating to these questions, I would love to hear it.   The closest you'll get is by using an FPGA.\n\nThe factories that fab'd those chips *don't exist anymore*. Also, specific to the N64, fucken RAMBUS.

It's the only way they can be as cheap as they are. The actual making of the chip is relatively cheap.

If they retool them more than a couple of times, the entire plant will generate a loss, and everyone involved goes bankrupt.\n\nWhile that last paragraph is a guess, I think it's not too far from the mark, as the margins on computer hardware are sooooo tiny. I can tell you with absolute certainty that the entire lifetime of the plant is budgeted for, from before they lay a single foundation right to the demolition of the plant and the safe disposal of the remains. To the special training the local fire departments need, to the cost of council approval, to the inflation of the wages of the employees.\n\nIf you think I'm bending the truth there, one of the \"cleaning agents\" used in chip fab is the almighty Chlorine Triflouride, a chemical so good at oxidising it puts oxygen to shame.

Thanks for this info. This is the kind of insight that I lack that I was referring to :3\n\nThe plants are only set up with the presumption that they will need to keep on making millions of the exact same chip (say, over four years?). If sales aren't the required number of millions by year two, then the entire operation will be a loss. And with no one paying licenses to use the hardware per sales unit, you can't take a loss of millions of dollars.\n\nWould it be one day conceivable to do a run of chips that contain like individual thousands of individual cores in nano scale of every processor design from 1971-2003 for example? I can imagine that one company wouldn't mind being the sole distributor of such a chip.\n\nI really don't know anything about it though.

Could such a FPGA fully \"emulate\" exactly what the SNES chips did, or old corporate super computers? Doh, ninja edit fail :-)\n\nNot so much emulate, as *actually become* that chip. To my limited knowledge, the only limits are the amount of information you can get about the original chips, and the gate count of the FPGA you're using.\n\nFPGA's are a bit past my knowledge of computers. All I really know is that...\n\n* They're magic.\n* They're \"programmed\" with evil programming languages with names like \"Verilog\".\n* FPGA's are commonly used to make custom, single shot chips that are extremely specialised, and often perform their specialised calculations faster than normal, generic chips.\n* Just because it's one FPGA, does not mean you have to use it to simulate *one* chip. It's quite possible to have \"multi-core\" chips created inside a single FPGA. The only limit is the gate count. Thanks for this info.

It would be 9999909238x cheaper to just emulate the console on a small modern computer, put it in a console case and just map all the IO connections to USB.  This is so cheap/easy that individuals actually do this in the spare time.  Projects like rasberry pi make this cheaper than ever (25$ for a computer that can easily emulate a ~~PS2~~ N64, with higher quality video).\n\nWhy build a plant to make old hardware? Not that you are entirely wrong, but emulating a PS2 is VERY hard. This piece of hardware is an incredibly complex and unusual design. To emulate it on a PC, you need a top of the line, highly overclocked machine. In comparison, Wii emulators run on an average gaming PC.\n\nA Raspberry Pi is barely fast enough for N64 emulators. Fair enough, thanks for the correction.  I just remember running a PS1 emulator on a P4 several years ago, I guess I over corrected. Not that you are entirely wrong, but emulating a PS2 is VERY hard.

Because emulation isn't the same and chip level emulation requires incredible power (as well as not ever being possible for the chips in the N64, according to the maker of the bsnes emulator).\n\nI kind of suspected that it would be infeasible to ever make old processors again, exactly to spec anyway. It just seems sad that when these old devices die out, that it's possible that no one will ever be able to use them again exactly the same way that millions of people used them when they first came out (or exactly the same way that the directors of the software being ran on them expected they would run). It's a good thing the N64 is built like a tank. I have one that's been running well for the past 15 years now. It takes abuse like a champ. If someone keeps good care of the system, I don't see any reason it couldn't last through 50+ years of moderate use.   the n64 is a classic console?? suddenly i am an antique owner! seriously though, they are easy to pick up for next to nothing, which might give you some idea of the profitability of a clone. It's 16 years old. 16. the n64 is a classic console?? suddenly i am an antique owner! seriously though, they are easy to pick up for next to nothing, which might give you some idea of the profitability of a clone. I guess a flash card for old N64s would be more profitable than a clone at the moment.  NES on a chip? I wonder what sort of space would be requited to do a SoC of the NES at with a 22nm process? Maybe a few mm^2? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Famicom_clone_PCB.jpg\n\nNo idea what the process was, but you get the idea.      The target is not retro silicon. What you do is you target the latest ARM quad cores with co-processor arrays. \n\nThe licensing costs for these things are tiny. The trick is, it's all SMT. But that doesn't mean you can't do it. \n\nYou start off with a solder pot see. And then you make like a hundred and try and get someone to copy you. \n\nCheck out Adapteva and Tilera. Also look for many-core as opposed to multi-core. Usually emmulator systems would want to use both a multi-core such as a quad-core at high clockspeed. But the real emmulation work should be totally offsourced to a big array of 2Hz ARM cores like 64 or so. \n\nAnother issue is the memory. They often call the memory on these things network-on-a-chip or mesh but the gist of it is they are more like a network available for offloading a lot of work. \n\nAs for a languages, you're wanting to learn as much as you can about CUDA. That's where it's at and that's why Torvalds is yelling about NVidia. They are like a cancer. It's a huge crime they've committed all these years. They sell that crap to schools and they don't allow you to use an open driver. What kind of shit is that.  I started thinking your post was bullshit. After some more time I've realized it isn't, just slightly incoherent. An upvote for you.\n\nSome explanations: SMT = surface mounted technology (your microchips sit on top rather than have pins going through your PCB or circuit board). Solder pot = dip your things into molten solder and then stick them together. Mentioned as using typical hand soldering on SMT is either impossible or a black art and as a way to build a prototype for a possible emulation system. \n\n2 HZ? A clock speed of twice a second will do fuck all. Maybe if you meant 2 Mhz, but even then, what you have is nothing like the original hardware, and if you are going to emulate it just grab a modern x64/x86 processor. Ok Tilera and Adapteva are super cool after looking it up; but it seems that the main selling point for using a shit-ton of parallel chips is power consumption... which matters for servers and data centres but not really for emulators. Also they use frequencies closer to 500 Mhz.\n\nAnd CUDA? Fuck that, OpenCL ftw, it's a standard and better. My impression is that it's going to win (but I work at AMD so that just might be the propaganda they feed me talking). They are both API's for doing non graphics calculations on GPUs (or potentially even FPGAs) The target is not retro silicon.

    "snippet" : "I am a recent high school graduate, who has been programming in C++ since I was 11. I know x86 Assembler, C/C++ and Java. I won't be learning anything new in CS for the first 2-3 semesters in college. The introduction class, algorithms and data structure classes are prerequisites for the rest of the CS curriculum. I have already taken Data Structures and Algorithms this past year, which was the practical, implementation approach. I am currently watching the algorithms class on MIT OCW to get a grasp of the more theoretical aspects. And I can say that I am understanding it; it's just a bit dry. This summer, I will be watching the multivariable calculus, intro to algorithms and Physics III lectures through MIT OCW. I have had experience in robotics through FIRST; I personally wrote an implemented my interpretations of the PID controller and Kalman Filter, but that's about it. I have followed the first week or two of the Udacity Robot Car class, but never really followed through. What fun thing can I do during summer? Euler's Project is on the list, writing an Android app is on the list. Perhaps, I can really dive into parallel processing through the use of my PS3. But those are all \"practical\" things. \n\nWhat can I be doing to learn the more theoretical aspects of CS? To be honest, I really don't know much of what happens on the theoretical side of CS.  Regardless of what you study, don't forget to go outside and have some fun. Regardless of what you study, don't forget to go outside and have some fun.  Write a regular expression parser. Start with strictly regular languages, then expand on it. This is a great way to learn the hierarchy of formal languages, as well as understand the degree to which \"regular expressions\" in modern languages go far beyond that.\n\nWhen you're happy with your parser, optimize it. In the process, you can learn a lot about computer architecture, the value of a good testsuite when writing a complex piece of software, and some of the traps and pitfalls of optimizing code for performance.  Well first of all automata and language theory is the basis of everything... a bit of lambda calculus and combinators can't hurt. After you understand the models of computation, check out computability and complexity. That is the basis any CS graduate should understand.\n\nSemantics and verification is another big field, especially concerning static analysis and parallel programming, so you can look a bit into that. Operational/Denotational/Axiomatic semantics, Hoare logic, temporal and modal logics, CCS, bisimulation...\n\nReally, there's so much stuff. What would interest you? Either way, AUTOMATA theory is a total and complete basis from which EVERYTHING is built, so definitely check that out.\n\nIf you don't know much math, watch some set theory, discrete math fundamentals, relations, functions, graphs, groups, little bit of universal algebra can't hurt, rewriting...\n\nOh and also, **learn HASKELL!!!** He has 1 summer, not 200 summers. So? One uni course is usually 12*2 hours, that's 24 hours of material. You can learn that in a week. I don't go to lectures all year, learn the shit, ace the test. It's not hard if you work a little bit :/ If your uni only asks you to work 2 hours a week per course, chances are your degree isn't worth the paper its printed on. So?

Do this online course: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/\n\n  You will learn all the theory you need in school. Most of the stuff you mentioned, you know, doing online courses and the like, is pretty impractical.\n\nSeriously, if you want to be valuable to employers when you start applying for internships, you need to show practical experience.\n\nWhat you need to do is to code an app, web or mobile it doesn't matter. Get a bunch of APIs together and create a cool mashup. \n\nYou need to get involved with the community as well. Go to www.meetup.com and look for hackathons or tech events around your area and attend.\n\nYou will learn all the theory you need at school, and not enough practical stuff.   after all your theory studying make sure to read up on how to write good code. knowing about lambda calculus and finite automata is fine and dandy but if you write shit code you aren't any better off   Solve/implement an algorithmic problem that you think is interesting e.g. path finding, parallel sorting, etc. Try and make a solution that someone else hasn't come up with yet. My first project on the PS3 will be porting my multithreaded mergesort I wrote in java last year. I will have to be mindful of the fact that the PS3 has SIMD Processors; I'll have to optimize to take advantage of that. Cool, I wrote a parallel merge-sort recently - it was lock free. Was your implementation lock free? Yes, since each thread never worked on the same piece of data. Unless if I am not mistaken, it is lock free. What about merge? How would you check for locks? I haven't really thought about it until you brought it up. I just assumed that the RAM can be written by more than one instruction concurrently. You can look at it; it's not the most efficient since it's not an inplace algorithm. http://pastebin.com/QbBtm9jM Thanks - interesting implementation - it isn't completely parallel since the last merge will only run on one CPU. You are correct regarding locks, and in this sense you divide the work across n threads which isn't very efficient. At the very least, check if the amount of data to be sorted is &gt; K (for K ~= 8, 16, 32) and only use threads if the amount of data is bigger. ",

If so, which locations are best?\n\n**EDIT: * **Are online classes a good option?**  For obvious reasons, it seems like a computer science degree would be doable online.  Is this possible/a good idea? Are there any reputable online programs?  Silicon Valley (by San Francisco) is the most famous for computer science. It houses the world headquarters of Google, Apple, and Facebook, *a large Microsoft complex*, and many more large and small companies.\n\nSomeone from my high school got his CS degree in Nebraska and immediately moved to SF because he knew he could find a job there. If you have a good GPA and get involved in research and such, once you get to SF companies will actually mail you and ask you to come into interviews. At least, they did for him.\n Just to be pedantic, the \"world headquarters\" of Microsoft is in Redmond, WA. There are a number of other large companies in the Seattle area as well, so it would not be a bad place to consider living. Yeah, I know there are a lot here but I don't know how many I could rattle off.  Amazon, obviously, and Google has an office in Kirkland.  And somewhere around here there are a couple Nintendo offices, although I don't know if they do dev work here.  And lots of startups. And Valve is in Bellevue, and Pop Cap is somewhere nearby. I know I've seen IBM and Oracle offices around as well, although I don't know how much dev work they do. Also Nokia!

From a practical standpoint, usually the third and fourth years are where you've completed all of your basic classes and you really start to get taking the fun/interesting/specialized electives. This serves a couple purposes. You get to see if there's something in particular that you really love or really hate working on.  You get a basic background in it, which opens up job opportunities even if it's not specifically what you're interested in.

Having any degree helps.  \n\nKnowing your way around a few common programming languages is good, knowing something about software design is also good.\n\nKnowing about networks of all types and various bits of hardware is awesome.  \n\n        You don't need a CS degree to work as a programmer. Actually, in many cases it wouldn't teach you how to code properly. Get yourself a software engineering course it would be much more beneficial to your career. And after it you would be able to make an educated guess do you really need a CS degree or not. It may not be mandatory if you're already super talented, but let's not kid ourselves here. Nearly all HR people will toss applications for developer jobs from people who have no CS degree. The few developers I've talked to who had no degree were either in school or planning to go back to school because their situation sucked. I'm saying that CS course and Software Engineering course are different things. If you are planning to do programming and not academic work you better go with SE.  \nI don't care how good you at coloring graphs if you can't write clean, concise, well-documented, and testable code.

Then moving onto a senior University to complete your CS education.\n\n\n&gt; Does the school I go to matter? Any recommendations for good schools?\n\nThat depends on what you are going to use the degree for.  If you just want the paper so you can get a good job and make good money it likely doesn't matter, you will have a hard time no matter where you go.  \n\nIf you actually want a high quality education then yes the school you go to matters.  The material you learn will likely not be different but the requirements and expectations you meet at just at another level at top schools.  Many schools these days are cutting out the math in CS curriculum making them weaker and easier to attain for those less capable.  \n\nLook for a school that you can afford that is the highest possible rank.  Take a look at their requirements. One way to spot a good school is if they have required classes like Theory of Computation or classes that require non imperative languages.  \n\n&gt; Does the location matter? I live in Minnesota, but I am in a position right now where I can easily pick up and move to another state. Is location a big factor in computer science careers? If so, which locations are best?\n\nIt doesn't matter.  You may have to move upon graduation. &gt;If you are going to school to make more money you are doing it wrong.\n\nThis is kind of a bullshit response. Doing what you love is a noble goal, but living in poverty fucking sucks. Getting an education to try and enter a lucrative field is perfectly valid. CS is not a subject you need to go to school for to do well.  Plenty of self taught first times out there making 80K/yr with nothing more then a few fun projects and a thirst for wikipedia articles. CS is not a subject you need to go to school for to do well.  Plenty of self taught first times out there making 80K/yr with nothing more then a few fun projects and a thirst for wikipedia articles. The thing is that the only way you can learn something is to teach yourself; no matter how you do it, listening to university lectures or reading books and wikipedia articles.  \nThe point of going to university is structured courses, course projects and more importantly a professional networking. Sure, this will not make you a decent programmer, but I believe it make your odds better. Some companies actively don't hire CS grads over self taught due to just how horrible most CS grads are.

Maybe not 90% but certainly over 50% http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html That article has no statistics about the percentage of CS graduates who cannot program a solution to a \"FizzBuzz\" type problem. It has some hyperbole about applicants that cannot do it, but those applicants would include all applicants, regardless of background, so that doesn't seem to back up your statement. It actually does it says it in bold\n\n&gt; The majority of comp sci graduates can't. I've also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution. CS is not a subject you need to go to school for to do well.  Plenty of self taught first times out there making 80K/yr with nothing more then a few fun projects and a thirst for wikipedia articles. I call bullshit. If you have an easy business idea or are a fucking rockstar self-taught programmer you might be able to do that, but there is no substitute for a solid CS education for 99% of developers. Maybe you can get some lucrative web-design jobs without a four-year degee but serious paid development is done almost exclusively by trained professionals. You have a serious disconnect with that is really going on at many companies mainly startups these days. Formal education has essentially been shown to be irrelevant.\n\nIt hurts me to say it because I do have a CS degree and worked hard for it but I am just being realistic. I know too many people who never went to college making 80K+/yr writing software to write this off as just a few outliers.  Some of them are even in director positions at major software consulting businesses and they make a lot more than 80K/yr.  \n Those must be the \"rock star programmers\" I mentioned. If you have a great track record and/or start your own business, you probably can get paid to develop with few credentials. Web development in particular is lucrative and needs little in the way of theory. But if you want to work for a software company, they typically won't even call you unless you have the credentials or tons of experience in lieu of credentials.",

It's a heavy text with difficult and complicate concepts in the areas of data mining, interference, and prediction. The problem is that I have a full time job that takes up more than 45 hours of my time each week. What kind of habits / tricks can I use to get this beast read from front to end?\n\nEDIT: I do understand that motivation (or interest?) comes naturally for some; however, I genuinely believe that there is a long term benefit from doing things that are may be uncomfortable or difficult to complete.  Pick a problem from the problem sets and then go back and learn what you  need to solve it.  I started doing this with computer science publications (implementing what the paper describes) and it can be a lot of fun and I feel more productive than just the reading.  Eventually you will have covered the good stuff in the book, though maybe not end to end. My approach is similar, even though it is not intended for the purpose of reading a book: (1) Pick a real-world problem you want to solve. (2) Go read enough material in books to make some progress. (3) Make some progress. (4) Finished? If not, go to step (2). (5) Finished! Go to step (1).\n\nI've ended up reading a good part of Elements of Statistical Learning (it's a good book) that way, and even more scientific papers. \n\nEDIT: On the topic of Machine Learning, especially for learning purposes (no pun intended), I suggest learning to use [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) (see [here](http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/) for a tutorial on implementing some basic ML stuff in it). It makes the nitty-gritty implementation of a lot of stuff much nicer than it would otherwise be. You can just compose your model and it does the annoying stuff of computing gradients and compiling the thing to C or CUDA for you. It still has some sharp edges off the beaten track (e.g. for some operations, it can't compute derivatives of derivatives), but the basics work, it's extensible and works well with the numpy/scipy/matplotlib toolset (which itself is essentially \"Matlab for Python\", pretty good for this kind of stuff even without Theano).

    "snippet" : "To further elaborate, imagine the vm had to implement a CPU and attached video and keyboard that would be roughly equivalent to something like an Apple II capable machine.\n\nWhat would the be minimal stuff that you would have to put in the CPU for example?\n\nBeing that this is the compsci reddit, feel free to point me to relevant papers or theory I should look at. I have been a hobbyist programmer for twenty years, but very light on theory and roughly about a first or second year level of CS.  Asking about the minimal necessary isn't really an interesting question.  You can construct a universal Turing machine in as few as 6 instructions.  Such a machine would be hellish to program or use, but it can provably compute anything that any other computer can.\n\nThe 6502 that the Apple ][ used had 56 instruction mnemonics.

ISA design is as much about making a system that humans can actually get their brains around, or at least it was in those days.\n\nThe Python VM has I believe 119 opcodes, the JVM has 205, the .Net CLR has 218.  Those are of course operating at a much higher level, but it gives you an idea of the size of things.\n\nBy the way, things like video and keyboard are pretty much irrelevant from the standpoint of the instruction set.  Hardware is memory mapped, so that for example writing to or reading from registers of the video controller is just like reading/writing any normal memory address from the standpoint of the CPU -- everything goes over the same bus.  Some architectures have IO ports as well as memory mapping, but that just means you have a couple of extra instructions that take a port number and read or write a value into a register.  It's still hardware independent. Actually, you can do it in one.\n\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer I was gonna say. You can solve bsat (any problem) using NAND I believe. damn you! I came here to say nor or nand is the only instruction you need. &gt;nor or nand\n\nDon't you mean nor xor nand? I was gonna say. You can solve bsat (any problem) using NAND I believe. This blew my mind.  And I learned it in a philosophy course. Asking about the minimal necessary isn't really an interesting question.

Or you could implement a Turing Machine, extremely simple and easy to implement, Turing complete, but a pain to write programs for.\n\nIf you want more of a \"real world\" example then a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) would be ideal.  See the PowerPC instruction set here: http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/vakken/in1200/labcourse/instruction-set/\n\nWriting an emulator for a simple CPU is often included in a first year Computer Science course so it's a good exercise. My university must suck, it was in the second year :( No, my university sucks - I'm almost done with my third year, and there were no emulators in sight. No, my university sucks - I've been graduated ten years and never did it! My university must suck, it was in the second year :( My university must suck, it was in the second year :( My university must suck, it was in the second year :( Try writing one yourself for something simple, like a 6502 or z80.  It's a steep learning curve in the beginning, so try to follow (but not copy!) existing emulator source code that is easy to read (i.e. something most likely made to  teach. If you're looking for 6502 stuff, look up Dan Boris). Writing even a simple emulator is a great way to learn the basics of instruction sets, addressing modes, binary encoding, etc.\n\nI tried writing a 6502 emulator my sophomore year and learned a ton from it (then learned more later after reviewing my code and writing more emulators). In second year I've written a MIPS pipeline simulator in SystemC, it was fun. what software can we use to run systemc code?  You only need a single instruction: CMOV  (conditional move).  The advantage of having a single instruction is that you don't need to encode it!  So your program consists only of triples of addresses (test src dst).\n\nYou can have \"registers\" and an ALU, both memory mapped.\nHave a look at an example here:\nhttp://paste.lisp.org/display/130083     Looking past the concerns raised by other commenters, I would include the following instructions in a \"minimal-but-useful\" instruction set:\n\n* LOAD (mem-&gt;reg)\n* STORE (reg-&gt;mem)\n* MOV (reg-&gt;reg)\n* ADD (a += b, set carry flag)\n* SUB (a -= b)\n* MUL (a *= b)\n* AND (a &amp;= b)\n* OR (a |= b)\n* XOR (a \\^= b)\n* NEG (a = ~a)\n* SHL (a &lt;&lt;= b)\n* SHR (a &gt;&gt;= b)\n* CMPZ (a == 0?)\n* BZ (branch if zero)\n* BC (branch if carry)\n* B (unconditional branch)\n\nIncidentally, this is pretty much a limited version of the [MIPS instruction set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture). :)\n\nNote that this architecture would be prohibitively slow with floating-point numbers due to the lack of hardware support for IEEE754. Also note that an integer divide instruction is missing: This is for the same reason that ARM excludes it (divide-by-constant can be transformed to a multiply-by-constant, and divide-by-value can be implemented in terms of subtract and add). I've always wondered and now seems like a good time to ask:\n\nto support signed vs unsigned integers do you need to have different instructions for signed and unsigned comparisons?\n\nBecause I don't see how else you could manage to properly handle proper comparisons of int, negative ints, and uints larger than INT_MAX        You only need nand.\n\nNinja edit:  only nor will work too.\n\nAnother:  Someone beat me to it. NAND is a type of gate, not an instruction.\n its both.  &gt; minimal\n\nThis isn't the right way to think about it. Either you fully emulate the operation of a device, or you don't. Going halfway isn't really a meaningful exercise. &gt; minimal\n\nThis isn't the right way to think about it. Either you fully emulate the operation of a device, or you don't.

Some (incorrectly I have realised) use them interchangeably, while others separate them by their individual definitions.\nI have personally, however, difficulties in precisely being able to distinguish their separate meaning. Can someone here help me with a sort of \"explain it to me like im five\"?\n\nI have read definitions such as:\n\nMethodology:  *\"organized collection of concepts, methods, beliefs, values and normative principles ...\"*, *\"organize sets of behavioral and technical rules into a coherent approach which prescribes how to address major development problems\"*\n\nMethod: *\"specify procedure for accomplishing well-defined task\"*, *\"'technique' is defined as a way of accomplishing a task. ... A method is a well-defined description of a technique. A method is always documentable whereas a technique need not be.\"*  The way I see it the methodology is the heuristic and the method is the algorithm.  I dunno about explaining it like you are five, but how about middle school? Think back to 7th grade science class.\n\nWhen you were faced with a problem, or a question to answer, you used the scientific method (Question -&gt; Research -&gt; Hypothesis -&gt; Test -&gt; Analyze -&gt; Conclude -&gt; Report). This in fact was a methodology.\n\nThe steps you actually took (1. Get 2 slices of bread. 2. Get out peanut butter. 3. Spread peanut butter) were the method.\n\nSo, a method is exactly how you go about doing something. A methodology is how you would go about constructing a method.\n\nNow, to apply to Computer Science, or more specifically software engineering: You are developing a piece of software for the customer. The *method* in which you code is to:\n\n1. Define Classes\n1. Define Variables\n2. Define Functions\n\nBut, say you are using the Watefall Model (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance) to build your product. That, is a *methodology*.\n\n\nI think the Wikipedia article for [Methodology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) does a pretty good job explaining it at a higher level.  I am interested in how this differs from or overlaps with the terms Process, Procedure and Work Instruction.  With these three there is the same general/abstract to specific/concrete spectrum.

Free online now.    Realtime rendering, 3rd edition by haines, moller etc, is the only good book on the subject.   I think this really depends on the specific area in graphics that interests you. For instance, the techniques used in creating images for real-time uses such as video games tend to differ from those used for photo-realistic film quality renders. \n\nIf you'd like to actually dive into the principles behind rendering (which broadly apply to both), I'd strongly recommend [Physically Based Rendering, Second Edition: From Theory To Implementation](http://www.amazon.com/Physically-Based-Rendering-Second-Edition/dp/0123750792/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339713282&amp;sr=1-1). It's largely up to date, and come with source code. \n\n\nSince you mentioned that this is intended to prepare you for a research career, there's nothing better than going directly to the source! Reading the seminal papers in rendering can be a very useful exercise. This [list](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/doctoral/phdcs-qualifier/graphicsvis/rendering)  is a good one to begin with (I'd use this in conjunction with the mentioned book). \n\n\nIt's a little harder to stay on top of the latest research for real-time rendering. This [book](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Third-Edition-Akenine-Moller/dp/1568814240/ref=pd_sim_b_4) is a reasonable starting point. You may also want to take a look at the latest papers at SIGGRAPH or Eurographics if you intend to pursue research in rendering, but these tend to be fairly advanced since rendering is a relatively mature area in graphics.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have other questions - I'm working on my PhD in graphics (although not on rendering).      I've read [this one](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/). I'm curious how it compares to other books, but I've been too lazy to follow up.\n\nOne thing I like is that it goes straight to the modern, programmable, real-world pipeline, without the \"training wheels\" of the fixed-function pipeline. Harder to start with, but I now have a sense that I actually understand what the graphics hardware is doing.",

I just finished my first year of graduate studies and need to start working towards my thesis.  \nThe problem is that I have no previous research experience. I don't know how it works. How do people come up with a novel topic/problem to solve? Before I started grad school, I was worried about how I would go about solving a completely new problem. But now that I am at this stage of starting my research, I don't even have a problem to solve. I'm also worried that if and when I do come up with something, it might be more than I can handle. I don't want to start working on something and later realize that the problem is beyond my capabilities (or the time I have is not enough to solve it).  \nI'm sure there are other people who have faced this problem. How did you work it out?\n\nEdit: I know this is a very vague and subjective question. I don't expect a concrete answer.

    "snippet" : "This may sound pretty retarded, but I'm trying to implement some typed [SKI-combinator functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus) (and maybe some other well-known lambda functions) in Java as some kind of experiment.\n\nBut I have a problem with the types of some functions. [Here is the typed code that I already have implemented](http://pastebin.com/zz19xx8n).\n\nYou can see that I can get the result from *result2* (121) and *result4* (129). But  the line that gives *result3* (125) gives a type error because function *g* and *x* are not correctly typed. And I don't know how to solve it.\n\nI tried to solve it by given *K* only one type parameter, but I can't seem to let the other type disappear. Does anyone know how I can do that?\n\nI don't have this problem if I only give a type to the output of the function: [see it in this example.](http://pastebin.com/azCp08ez).\n\nI know that these combinators (and lambda functions) ar normally untyped. So is it possible in Java to make the SKI-combinators fully typed like I wan't to do? \n\n\n*EDIT*: [here is the same done in Haskell.](http://pastebin.com/WUF7LjUj)  Well sure it doesn't work. 'x' is a function from Integer to Object, and you give it Function&lt;...&gt; as an argument.\n\nAlso keep in mind Function is **NOT!!!!!!!!!!!** a supertype of Function&lt;T&gt;. I know that.\n\nBut I can't seem to find a good type so that all results can be calculated. Well you can't find it because it's not possible in java :) Type erasure is a bitch.\n\nIn haskell, type 'a' can specialize to 'b-&gt;c' no problem, in java, nope.\n\nWell actually. What you're trying to do doesn't even make sense. Once you have K: Int -&gt; Obj -&gt; Int, you have to pass the correct type, that's the point of types.\n\nEdit: Oh I see... you're doing K:(Int -&gt; Obj) -&gt; Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Obj). The currification is backwards\n\na -&gt; b -&gt; c = a -&gt; (b -&gt; c) not (a -&gt; b) -&gt; c\n\nI just skimmed your code, but this makes more sense\n\ninstead of \n\n    Function&lt;Function&lt;Integer,Object&gt;, Integer&gt; g = new K&lt;Integer, Function&lt;Integer,Object&gt;&gt;().apply(new Integer(7));\n\ndo\n\n    Function&lt;Integer,Function&lt;Object,Integer&gt;&gt; g = new K&lt;Integer, Function&lt;Object,Integer&gt;&gt;().apply(new Integer(7)); So it is not possible :(\n\nIsn't the type of Function and Function&lt;T&gt; the same at runtime?\n\nEdit: I tried it in Haskell first, and I could get it typed and let it work.\nSo there is no (ugly) workaround? It is same at runtime, but not at compile time, that's when you get the error :P It's quite messy due to backwards compatibility, read Effective Java, it's described pretty good there.\n\nAlso, I've edited the above comments, so reload them. Maybe it will fix this instance, but in general, I don't think you can do a fully typed solution with java. Thanks for the feedback, now I know that I can stop looking for a solution.\n\nThe change you proposed doesn't solve the problem. If I implement it and add a change to the type of x (to fix the type errors I'm getting), then *result2* and *result3* will work. But *result4* will give a type error.\n\nI wil just go with 'it is impossible'\n\n Wait actually, I think it might be possible.\n\nI wrote it out like this and I think you're simply trying to apply incompatible functions (and I'm sure this wouldn't work even in haskell)\n\n        // g :: Int -&gt; [(Int -&gt; Obj) -&gt; Int]  the part in [] is after application\n        // x :: Obj -&gt; [(Int -&gt; Obj)]\n        Function&lt;Function&lt;Integer,Object&gt;, Integer&gt; g = new K&lt;Integer, Function&lt;Integer,Object&gt;&gt;().apply(new Integer(7));\n        Function&lt;Integer,Object&gt; x = new K&lt;Object, Integer&gt;().apply(new Integer(3)); // here can be new Object() right?\n\n        int result2 = g.apply(x);\n        System.out.println(result2);\n\n        //// Should work, but gives an error because the type is wrong.\n        int result3 = x.apply(g); // x is of type Int -&gt; Obj, if you apply ((Int-&gt;Obj)-&gt;Int) as first parameter, it can't possibly work.\n        // (Int-&gt;Obj)-&gt;Int is not the same as Int-&gt;(Obj-&gt;Int)\n I know my functions are incompatible, because the types don't work out (that is my problem).\nThe types in my example code are the only typing I could find to make *result4* work.  They also let *result2* work, but not *result3*, and that is where my problem is. I can't seem to find a typing so all three results don't give type errors.\n\nThe types of *x* and *g* really look weird in my code, they suppose to have the same type, because they are practically the same function (only an other Integer has been put in). This probably won't help you in the slightest, but I believe the approach you're trying to use *would* work in .net, since it doesn't rely on type erasure. If it's just experimental stuff, you could totally use Mono. ",

I apologize in advance if this thread is too vague or unsuitable.\n\n(My score is V163/Q161=324, and I'm probably going to apply in Canada)  My GRE scores were (V 159, Q 170, W 4.0) and I was admitted to PhD programs at Stanford, UC Berkeley, CMU, and some other schools.\n\nI'm pretty convinced the GRE is a nearly worthless exam. The top schools claim to largely ignore it, but my guess is they use it to dwindle their application pool to a manageable size. Lower ranked schools may admit people based almost entirely on GRE+GPA. The best graduate students are those with the greatest research abilities, which is what the top schools are looking for. Research potential can not be measured by GRE scores.

I **BOMBED** English. Don't underestimate it. I believe I got a 780 in math. 300-800 score. 86th percentile. But English...was like 380. 28th percentile.  I was admitted for engineering, but I still wish I would have acknowledged the English portion. Lost a lot of opportunities for scholarships that way. Study for it. Read books. Take the free Kaplan GRE Tests.\n\nI'm not familiar with teh new scoring range (130-170?).  160 seems up there for both though. I think it's also a lot about percentile.  If you're top 10%, you're great. Even top %20 means you're in the top of 1/5th of people trying to better themselves. This isn't the ACT where everyone took it anyway, only determined people take this. hey thanks for your feedback. much appreciated. well, you still got into engineering! do you enjoy what you do now? I just graduated last month and start in August. Right now I intern, but I know I want to be a professor.  I like academia environments, not industry work.  Do Canadian universities ask for GRE scores if you're going into CS? If I recall correctly they don't for math, or at least Waterloo and U of T don't.  I failed GRE pretty badly (V=460 Q=720). I think I'm just not good at time management/studying. I skimmed those thick GRE books and took a couple of self tests but that's all I did to 'study' couple days before the test. Maybe this was a good indication that I was not ready for grad school.\n\nI then got a job, applied to CMU Silicon Valley campus, got rejected, and now I'm working.\n\nI kind of wanted to get M.S. while undergrad CompSci is still fresh in my mind while I work but I guess you don't always get what you want. gre isn't an indicator of programming/development ability at all. i myself am planning on an ms after nearly a 2 yr gap in education. its never too late- if you really want to, go for it.  From what I hear from college profs who do admissions into really exclusive humanities program, all the research has ever correlated a GRE score to is the chance that you'll finish a program.  Generally the higher the score, the greater your chance that you'll finish the program.  Even then, it's not a strong correlation.  Still it's required by many grad admissions programs.\n\nAlso, you may find that you're seemingly balanced GRE score (I don't know the new scoring system) is in your favour when applying to schools.",

I know of having two identical processors (which was quite common before the multi-core era).  Even if the BIOS/EFI and board support it, is there any OS that could make use of both?  If so, how likely would the OS actually efficiently deal with the discrepancy between the two processors?\n\nOn a side note, I know that the processor in the Nvidia Tegra 3 SoC utilizes what they call \"4-PLUS-1\" in which there are 4 main cores as well as one \"companion core\" running at a lower clock speed in addition to using a low power silicon process.  I assume any device utilizing this SoC is just programmed to put the other cores offline and utilize the 5th core just like how Android enables and disables cores on any other multi-core SoC.\n\nEDIT:  I should have been more specific.  An example of my question would be an x86 box with two processor sockets on the board but two different processors (both x86, both 32-bit OR 64-bit).  The NeXT computers had two processors: a 68030 or 68040, and a DSP56001.  Obviously, the \"BIOS\" and kernel handled both. (/dev/dsp sent data and programs to the DSP).\n\nNowadays, any PC with a graphic card has both a CPU (or several), and a GPU (or several).  There are ROMs on the graphic cards, and drivers in the OSes, to deal with the GPU parts, but the BIOS deals with it too (thru a de-facto standardized interface ports).\n\nSometimes, some other chip may be considered separate processors too.  Sophisticated DMA chips for example, could be loaded with a \"program\" to implement an I/O operation.  But I don't know what capabilities common DMA chips on PCs have. Thanks for your informative response.  I should have been more specific by mentioning that I meant two regular CPUs (like an x86 box with two processor sockets). The [NeXTdimension addon card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTdimension), which made the NeXT cube color-capable, had an Intel i860 CPU on board that ran its own operating system. There was also the [SunPCi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunPCi) that was an x86 processor for SPARC/Solaris machines. Neat!\n\nLet's also not forget [the plethora of add-in cards for the Apple II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_processor_cards) that would let you do things like run CP/M on an Intel 8088.

I should have been more specific by mentioning that I meant two regular CPUs (like an x86 box with two processor sockets).   Define 'different'.  Having slightly different performance characteristics is probably pretty common, especially when you consider a single system, rather than a single board. (For the record, a big NUMA machine like an SGI Altix tends to just look like a n processor machine, even though it's potentially spread over several racks.) As such, all of the commercial Unices, BSD and Linux should be pretty happy - it's just a scheduling tweak after all - and there are machines out there that require it. Some of the issues are not dissimilar to hyperthreading can create fairly similar scenarios.\n\nWell, there's been machines that have had processors of differing types.\n\nAcorn's BBC Micro supported an extensive set of add on second processor boards. Application logic tended to move to the second processor, whilst the first processor (in the base machine) handled. The Acorn RiscPC (from 1994) had an ARM processor and a x86 processor (on swappable cards) which shared the same memory bus. This was intended for DOS/Windows in a window, but it was used for other purposes, not least floating point acceleration. There's also many, many machines that have been traditional processors + DSPs.\n\nQuite a few supercomputers used traditional microprocessors in concert with vector processors (and/or FPGAs). In fact, this architecture is not that dissimilar to the PC's x86+GPU architecture (some supercomputers are x86 PCs with GPUs!).\n\nThe PC x86+GPU arrangement is exactly what's been targetted by things like OpenCL (where the same code can run on the CPU or GPU), so I suppose the answer is there's a long history of doing so, and the future appears to be multiple architectures on the same board, even in the same processor package or on the same die.\n\n Sorry for not being more specific.  The question I had in mind would be 2 x86 processors on one board.  My question would be how different clock speed, manufacturers, and possibly instruction sets would affect a system if it would even run.

X86 would not run.  Dissimilar CPUs add enormous amounts of complexity and none of the X86 motherboards, and operating systems (maybe linux has been tweaked?) support it.  AMD and Intel CPUs have slightly different instruction sets, so even if different clock rates or models from the same manufacturer were supported its unlikely someone would support both AMD and Intel CPUs in the same machine.\n\nAs others have mentioned its theoretically possible (even for X86), and other architectures have done it commercially.  But its much simpler to just require all the same CPUs.  You tend to see this more where CPUs are used for more specialized purposes.  The original Nintendo had a separate CPU to run sound while the main one ran graphics for example. Don't you remember mathematical co-processors for 386 and 486?

You can structure your computation to perform on both values simultaneously, as opposed to now where you need to perform them in sequence, one after the other.\n\nIf you have two qubits, you can perform computations on the following values simultaneously:\n\n    00\n    01\n    10\n    11\n\nAnd you can see as you add more qubits, the parallelization increases exponentially.  The final computation you extract can only be the computation you performed on one of those cases, so you need to construct your algorithm in such a way that the case you finally observe is the case that yields the correct answer.  The way that can be achieved is to simply run the algorithm numerous times and go with the answer that has the highest occurence.  Doing that will often still be much much faster than performing every combination in sequence. So in essence you could run four threads through the same two qubits at the same time? I guess a way of saying it would be you can run four threads at the same time on two qubits, however, the threads are all independent, so they can't talk to one another, they're also limited as to what they can compute, so they're not full blown general purpose threads, and at the end you will only see the result of one of the threads that executed, so you need to structure your algorithm so that the thread that you do 'observe' is likely to contain the right answer.  And given that this is only likely to be the right answer, you'll want to run it multiple times.\n\nThis is why quantum computing is amazing, but only provides speed ups to certain problems, specifically problems that can be described by a quantum process.  It's not like you can just take any algorithm and run it in a quantum computer and get exponential parallelization. Just curious, are there any practical problems that are already known or expected to remain hard even with quantum computers? Just curious, are there any practical problems that are already known or expected to remain hard even with quantum computers? What's the practical application of:\n\n&gt;A qubit in a quantum computer is capable of being both 1 and 0 at the same time\n\n?  What I find really interesting is that they did it in silicon. Elaborate, if you will. I'm curious as to why you noted that.\n Since silicon is already very abundant and used in most technological hardware, the fact that this quantum experiment also utilized silicon shows that this cheap resource can still be useful for a new breed of computers. \n\nIf we had to use some rare element for quantum computers to work, then it wouldn't be as accessible as modern computers already are now.  Elaborate, if you will. I'm curious as to why you noted that.\n The stability of qubits varies quite a bit with the type of qubit you are using. I work with a group using trapped ions, and those have no problem with keeping the qubits around for a long time.    The whole idea of quantum computing has always sounded like a load of bunk to me. I think it's safe to say that the time that a quantum computer can do anything remotely interesting will never come.",

    "title" : "Help with Prior distribution for Hawkes Process (Poisson process with time dependent intensity)",
    "snippet" : "Hi guys,\n\nI'm working on a project right now that involves running a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis on a Poisson cluster process (hawkes). I'm a little confused with how to write the acceptance ratio, however. For reference, there are three parameters involved in this process, and the intensity function relies on t (more on that later)\n\nFirst off, I've read what appears to indicate that acceptance occurs if a random uniformly distributed number on [0,1) is larger than:\n\n(p(y\\*|x) / j(y\\*|y)) \n\n/\n\n(p(y|x) / j(y|y\\*)\n\nwhere p represents the probability of generating our data (x) using the posterior distribution given by y, and j represents the probability of getting to y\\* from y. In simple list form\n\n* p() = posterior distribution\n* j() = chance of going from t -&gt; t*\n* y = current parameters (current state of markov chain)\n* y\\* = proposed parameters (proposed next state of markov)\n* x = data point (I'm using a discrete set of data as opposed to a distribution)\n\nI have a hunch that I'm using the notations wrong, as this is one of the first times I've really dealt with Bayesian statistics\n\nNow, my understanding is that the posterior distribution is based on a prior distribution multiplied times a likelihood function, L.\n\nSo, the formula I'm working with has the probability of an event happening at time t depending partly on the summation of t&lt;ti of (t-ti) (the summation of all t-tis for all tis smaller than t) where tis are the times of events that have happened prior to t.\n\nI'm really confused with how to generate the prior distribution. My understanding is that for a prior in a situation like this, one simply uses \"dummy\" parameters for the distribution. Would I effectively use dummy parameters and sum the probabilities of each data point occurring for each point in the data set, and call that the prior? As near as I can tell, that would just give me some kind of constant, and I don't think the prior is supposed to be a constant.\n\nThanks for reading this far, and if anything I've said is unclear, ask for clarification! (if you want to help me that is) I'm a novice to bayesian statistics, and I probably misunderstood either a definition or messed up the notation.  I'm afraid I am a bit confused with what you're trying to say in the last 3 paragraphs, but maybe this will clarify,\n\nYour acceptance ratio will be \n\np(x,y * ) j(y | y *)\n        /\np(x, y) j(y *| y)\n\nAssuming it is easy to calculate the prior on y and the likelihood of x given y, we can factor\n\np(x,y) = p(y) p(x | y)\n\nThus, every time you propose a new sample y* from j(y* | y), all the arguments in the ratio should be different.\n\nDoes that make sense?  I am not certain what p(y) or p(x | y) is in your model, but if you can get a grasp of those (and are certain you truly are sampling from j(y* | y) and calculating its likelihood properly), the algorithm should function.  I am a junior CIS major and I understood literally none of that except for Monte Carlo, assuming you're talking about a Monte Carlo method.  \nNothing constructive to add, just saying.

My name is Matthew Kaminski, and I'm a history student at the Masters Program at UMass Boston. The subject of my thesis is the role of John Rowe and the BSETC merchants in fomenting the Stamp Act riots, non-importation movement, and Tea Party. Several months ago I posted a low-quality photocopy of a Masonic Code on a letter located in the Massachusetts Historical Society to the /compsci subreddit. (Original Here: http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/twl6j/who_wants_to_help_me_crack_an_18th_century/).  You [Sterling examples of masculinity] did the whole proof of identity thing then, so don't question my existence or credentials. The letter was written by William Gordon, a semi-successful Author, Preacher and Freemason. The letter has a complex code written in the margins, which seems to have several possible solutions. I just got back from the MHA and, after getting permission, took some higher quality photographs for you to examine and perhaps solve. If anyone wants more information on Gordon or wants to read Gordon's book on algorithmic code creation (available online), I would be happy to come back in a few minutes and add some comments. The Gordon Code is available here: http://imgur.com/a/isCoU\n\n[EDIT] TLDR: Help me solve this masonic code and win the respect of the Reddit Community! (Warning: Prize does not actually exist.)\n[EDIT] Here are the original low quality scans, to help orient the viewer: http://imgur.com/a/rfLtk  There are two issues here: the first is converting the worn and hand written glyphs to something legible and/or computer readable, then decrypting the message.  You are the only one qualified to handle the first, and I believe that basically everyone in the previous thread told you to do that.  Yet you've returned with basically the exact same situation, albeit higher quality photos!\n\nIf you really want help, you need to take the bits you have, develop an alphabet, e.g.\n\nglyph1 = X; glyph2 = Y; glyph3 = X ...\n\nand then after completing the vocabulary you need to transliterate the texts you want decrypted from the handwritten notes to the computer-readable alphabet.  \n\nOnce you do this, you can just post the transliterated texts to r/compsci, r/programming, r/machinelearning and whatever other sites you like and I can all but guarantee that you will have a billion answers (of varying quality) in a couple of days, as well as a couple of people that will become very interested in helping you take it further.\n\nAt the moment however, you are basically asking for us to do everything for you, including this bit that your experience, not ours, is first and best suited to. Everyone in the previous thread asked me for higher quality photos.

I took time to go make high quality digital photos because everyone who commented on the last post wanted them.  I am not going to profit from this in any way, and I've already spent hundreds of hours [EDIT: Maybe 100 Hours] trying to do what he recommended.  Go back and read the comments on the last post, he really just stole what everyone else said and didn't add anything new.  Sorry about my tiredness and rudeness, but he didn't add anything new and if it were that easy I wouldn't need to post it.  It's probably an algorithm from the 1700s, I thought you guys might be interested but never mind. I'll solve it this summer and Reddit won't get any credit.    What it sounds like you're saying is \"Hey, I found this thing that can be beneficial to my degree. I don't have the slightest clue of how to solve it, and I'm not willing to try or learn for myself what is needed to solve it. I ask you to do this for me. I will be offended if you ask me to have some part in deciphering this text, so don't ask me.\"\n\nGo fuck yourself. I don't know why I'm still responding to these, but here goes:\n1) I apologize for being a jerk, but I was told to come back with higher scans and that's why I got angry when that person said. \"All you've done is come back with higher scans.\"  That's what I was asked to do.  I upvoted everyone who said this in the first post: \"http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/uwrvq/who_wants_to_help_me_solve_a_17th_century_code/c4zal8r\" because they were being helpful, but I also said I've been trying to do exactly that for months.  I'm not the only person uniquely qualified to make a transliteration, because the reason I'm here IN THE FIRST PLACE is that I'm not sure if certain symbols are the same and written differently or are actually different.  That's why I published it, so people can do it if they want.  For instance, are these all the same symbols or should I count them differently?  http://imgur.com/a/j6BQk#16\n\n2) This is completely unconnected to my Masters Degree, and I'm not making any money off it.  In fact, by making this code public before I solve it, I might be losing the ability to publish it in a historical journal and get actual credit for it.  If I sat on this and didn't publish it here, I guarantee I could write and publish a real book on William Gordon soon.  That probably won't happen now.\n\n3) My dickishness notwithstanding, if you go back and read the comments on the original post from a month ago, people were asking me to do exactly what this person is saying I should do, and quite frankly I can't.  I know that to solve the code you need to transcribe the code and put it into a context that can be analyzed, but there are too many symbols with slight variations to effectively put together a concrete syllabary and transliteration.  Again, I've tried and failed to do what he requested. \n\n4) This is a gift. I am not asking anyone to do any work.  Since I'm not demanding you do anything, by the same token I don't owe you anything. If you don't want to independently try to solve the code, then don't.  I took time out of my incredibly busy schedule to come back to this community with the higher quality scans that were requested from me, so that someone with more time than me could spend the insane amount of time required to solve it.  This is a unique opportunity to do something that no one else has done in the field of history.  If you don't want to crack the code on your own, then don't try.  I think I got it.  It says \"Be sure to drink your Ovaltine.\"    I'm puzzled. Since you're in Boston, why not attempt to collaborate with people there? Its not like the city isn't literally full of universities and I'm certain there are linguists and cryptographers (check for people in the math dept.) willing to (i) understand the glyphs and (ii) decode any possible encryption.  Good idea actually.  I've been trying to get some historians involved but obviously they're not too interested.  I'll see what I can do, a lot of my BU friends were engineers and linguists so that might be a better bet.   ",

    "title" : "How do researchers find topics to write about?",
    "snippet" : "I am going into my second year of a CS program at my university, and I was hoping to spend my summer writing a very simple, introductory paper on some small topic in theoretical computer science (particularly logic, computation, or discrete mathematics). Since it's my first bit of academic writing, I don't expect it to be some grand work... in fact, I'm hoping to end up with maybe 2-4 pages total, depending on the topic I choose.  \n  \nMy main problem is that I have no idea where to look for topics that I am capable of taking on. I've been reading books in my spare time on computation, but have taken no courses yet, so my understanding is very rudimentary. However, if I find something that suits me, then I would have quite a bit of time to get some background information and maybe write an expository piece on the topic.  \n  \nSo, how can I find small questions to pursue over the summer? It seems to me that so much has been done in computation and logic that there's nothing I could contribute, but hopefully something is out there. Thank you for your advice!  My algorithm for finding topics is something like this:\n\n1. read lots of papers\n2. keep reading\n3. when I find myself saying \"why didn't they just...\" or \"nah, there's a better way\", stop.

The easiest way to find a question to work on is to go to a professor in your department who is researching something that interests you and ask them if you can help them on something, or if they have some ideas for you to work on. Since you're going into your second year, you may not have enough CS knowledge to work on a research project, but at the very least a professor could suggest topics to look into, and most will probably welcome your interest (and see you as a potential research assistant down the road). instead of a professor, ask someone more likely to be doing the work behind the research, i.e. assistants or grad students.  Is it a strong requirement that you do novel work? That's quite hard, because it means you have to know the literature thoroughly to be sure nobody worked on your topic before.\n\nHave you considered writing surveys of existing work instead? Take a subject you're interested in, seriously read as much papers as possible, and write a survey detailing the historical progression of the research (where did it start from? did the goal change over the course of the research? did new questions, or new application areas appear? what are the current hopt topics?). You are guaranteed to benefit a lot from this personally; other practitioners of the field may also like it. \n\n(For this to work best, you must choose a suitably restricted domain. \"logic\" or \"type systems\" is too large a subject for a reasonable survey. \"separation logic\" or \"type inference\" may be a more reasonable subdomain, though probably still a bit too large; you'll find out when diving in, in which subtopics you could specialize.)\n  My algorithm is different from others:\n\n1. Read a lot of papers.\n2. Implement something which you find is cool.\n3. As you adapt it to a problem you are interested in, figure out how can you improve the algorithm.\n4. Try to figure out formally, what you did, and see if it been done before. If not, then publish!  What sort of things do you do when you implement it?

    "snippet" : "So there are plots and a more detailed explanation of what I did here:\n\nhttp://www.wandertechnologies.com/2012/05/12/272/\n\nBut basically I was winging it implementing a stochastic hill climbing algorithm for minimizing a cost function, and later realized that I did it completely wrong, but in a way that worked very very well on noisy surfaces with lots of local minima and maxima, albiet slowly. \n\nI have trouble believing that I just made this up, but sort of need to know what it is called so I can properly reference what I did in a paper I am working on.  Any guesses?  Hey - it sounds like what you're doing is [random optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_optimization).\n\nFrom that wikipedia article:\n\n&gt;The basic RO algorithm can then be described as:\n&gt;\n* Initialize x with a random position in the search-space.\n* Until a termination criterion is met (e.g. number of iterations performed, or adequate fitness reached), repeat the following:\n * Sample a new position y by adding a normally distributed random vector to the current position x\n * If (f(y) &lt; f(x)) then move to the new position by setting x = y\n* Now x holds the best-found position.\n\nThough that's for minimizing, but it's obviously the same for maximizing except that you use the condition f(y) &gt; f(x).\n\nIf you're curious, I found this by googling \"maximization local search normal distribution\". It came up as the first result :) (but I tried a lot of other searches that didn't find it).  Strictly speaking, I don't even think this is a hill climbing algorithm.\nSince you move in multiple dimensions at a time, you lose that class...\n\nIt certainly isn't simulated annealing, this modifies the score associated with a space at a certain time point by taking it to the power of a decreasing geometric function; you don't do that.\n\nI can certainly draw parallels between what you do and other methods, but they really aren't the same.\n\n**My 'verdict'**:\nWhat you're doing appears to be \"finding the maximum in a random sample of size n\".\n\nI say random sampling because your method doesn't really take any advantage of the space around the current point, and it only accepts a new point if it is better than the previous sample.\n\nHope I helped :)!\n\n**edit**:\n\nAlso, look at the places where you searched...\nMany of the spaces are at the edges of the search space.\nMaybe if you were to sample your scaling parameters from a smaller distribution, you wouldn't be searching so far away... Definitely, this clearly is not my background, so it's all very interesting to me at this point.  Thanks  maybe you're thinking simulated annealing? Maybe.  That still seems to be dependent on neighbors though, as opposed to 'jumping' beyond neighbors stochastically to check spots 'near' but not necessarily 'adjacent' to the current location. Are you sure?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing\n\n&gt; By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm attempts to replace the current solution by a random solution (chosen according to a candidate distribution, often constructed to sample from solutions near the current solution). The new solution may then be accepted with a probability that depends both on the difference between the corresponding function values and also on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process.\n Are you sure?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing\n\n&gt; By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm attempts to replace the current solution by a random solution (chosen according to a candidate distribution, often constructed to sample from solutions near the current solution).

(With the locations of where to poll influenced by some knowledge of the landscape - that is where you say if a peak isn't found in one direction then you take and random location in the other).\n\nYou compare your algorithm to a single run of a stochastic hill climbing algorithm which seems like an unfair comparison. You might like to compare your algorithm to stochastic hill climbing with (purely) random restarts and see how they do. I have a feeling the purely random restarts will do better. For example you'd expect (given that a stochastic hill climb succeeds 56% of the time) to need only 1 restart this way. This is significantly fewer than the number of green dots for the jumps of your algorithm in the diagram.  ",

I will add this information in the article.\n\n &gt; The number of edges and stripes is not fixed but only delimited by N.\n\nEr, exactly. You need to specify how they grow with N. If the number of stripes grows linearly with N, you can do it with dynamic programming. I don't see how dynamic programming could help. Even if the *width* of the stripes ( the maximum number of vertices in a stripe ) is fixed, and the number of stripes grows linearly with N, there might be no subgraph which is a problem solution. This due to words of the kind `aA ... Bb` in terms of your problem description. Maybe you could elaborate a little what you had in mind? Yep I see what you're saying. I wouldn't mind trying to solve the simplest non-trivial case of this problem before trying the full general problem. Would you agree that the following case is as simple as can be without having an obvious solution?\n\n_K = 1. Each stripe has exactly 2 vertices. Each vertex in each stripe is connected to each vertex in the following stripe. Each vertex's number list has either 0 or 1 entries._  Let’s assume that each vertex numlist is of size 1. We can reduce your problem to that one (giving up the assumption that the DAG is layered as you describe). Then we can solve the problem by dynamic programming as follows.\n\nDefine P(u,v) to be the predicate “there is a valid path from u to v”. Then P(u,u) is false for all u.\n\nAnd, isn’t the following claim true?\n\nClaim: for u != v, P(u,v) is true if and only if one of the following three conditions holds:\n\ni) There is a an edge (a,b) such that P(u,a) is true and P(b,v) is true.\n\nii) The label of u and the label of v sum to zero, and there are edges (u,a) and (b,w) such that P(a,b) is true.\n\niii) The label of u and the label of v sum to zero, and there is an edge (u,v).\n\nIf indeed this claim holds, it gives you a dynamic programming algorithm running in time, say, O(N^4 ). You can probably improve that.\n\n[edit: added option (iii), fixed option (i)]\n The following label list doesn't fit into the categories i) - iii) \n\n`[1, -2, 2, -1, -1, 2, -2, 1]`\n\nif we assume that outermost labels ( which are bot `1` ) are assigned to `u` and `v` respectively. It nevertheless describes a path which can be reduced to []. Doesn't it fit into category (i)?  That is, it can be broken into two lists each of which is valid:\n\n      [1, -2, 2, -1]  +  [-1, 2, -2, 1]\n\n(Here the edge (a,b) mentioned in category (i) would be the edge between the two vertices labeled -1.)\n\n Sure, P(u,a) and P(b,w) are both true but P(a,b) isn't because its label set is [-1,-1] which is not reducable. However this implication might not be necessary. For condition (i), (a,b) only needs to be an edge.  P(a,b) is not part of the condition.\n\nedit:  To explain, a list of labels is valid iff either\n\ni) it is the concatenation of two valid lists of labels\n\nii) its first and last labels sum to zero, and the remaining list in the middle is a valid list,\n\niii) or, its first and last labels sum to zero, and the list has length two. Let’s assume that each vertex numlist is of size 1. We can reduce your problem to that one (giving up the assumption that the DAG is layered as you describe).

That is garbage!\n\nThere is nothing magical about a nuclear bomb.    All you really need is the weapons grade materials.   Downvoters: Actually, he's right. From wikipedia (although unsourced)\n\n&gt;With regard to the risk of proliferation and use by terrorists, the relatively simple design is a concern, as it does not require as much fine engineering or manufacturing as other methods. With enough highly-enriched uranium (not itself an easy thing to acquire), nations or groups with relatively low levels of technological sophistication could create an inefficient—though still quite powerful—gun-type nuclear weapon.\n\nLittle Boy was such a weapon. gsnedders below is correct that the scientists didn't test it (both because it was so simple and there wasn't enough material for a second bomb), but more weapons have been built (by South Africa, again according to Wikipedia).\n\nMost nations don't build these any more, because they're considerably less efficient and less safe than implosion weapons (which can basically only ever detonate if their explosive lenses are triggered). I don't think it's relevant. It's in dispute if they are trying to manufacture it, not actually to get a dirty bomb. Why would they *not* manufacture it, if it was *easy*? They are two different things. That doesn't address the question... That is garbage!\n\nThere is nothing magical about a nuclear bomb.    All you really need is the weapons grade materials.   a bomb is a lot different than a missile. One can make a dirty bomb easily - atomic bomb with more difficulty, H bomb with great difficulty, missiles capable of delivering h bomb with extreme difficulty.

While I don't deny the likely hood of a nation state behind this, the idea that an individual couldn't do this is simply bogus.  Especially if you know a bit about mathematicians.   Those guys aren't normal!    The idea that a single individual had the knowledge to develop, test, and deploy, several zero days, a hash collision that's never been done before, and the motive to do it, is pretty much impossible.  Unless this person had some wizard like knowledge and access to a super computer, it was 100% devolved by a nation-state, and I know of one who has a cyber organization with several people of this caliber and the resources to do it. There's a lot of room between \"an individual\" and \"a nation state\", right? I mean you don't need to be a nation to put 5 experts in a room with about $50K of computing hardware and that'll probably get you quite far.

However, I am unsure which book to pick. I don't think it should be too technical of a book, since the goal is not to progress to more advanced stuff. Rather, I would like it to be more of a fun semi easy read that still gives her some idea of what we do. Also, she has fairly little math background. \n\nMy own research is in AI and relates to algorithms and complexity as well.

While the book looks really good, it seems to be more of an intro to how computers work than to what CS is. I'm looking for something more focused around algorithms, complexity and such. While the book looks really good, it seems to be more of an intro to how computers work than to what CS is. I'm looking for something more focused around algorithms, complexity and such. You are absolutely right about that. However, as with any subject it is fruitful to get a basic understanding of the world surrounding it; in which it 'lives' and functions and on which it to some degree depends, so to speak. And for that purpose, I really can't think of any book that comes anywhere close to being as good as the one mentioned above.\n\nThat being said though; if she really want to understand your field and what you do - why don't you simply set aside a lot of time for sitting sown and talk to her about it, let her prod you with any questions she might have, however stupid they might seem to you? (And that is not a pejorative question - any \"expert\", wheter male or female, are prone to finding some questions from non-experts stupid). My apologies though if you have already tried that approach and found it not satisfactory :)\n\n While I agree with you I think I should stick to my main thing for now, this could come later if she feels like getting some more context. In my opinion algorithms as a more abstract topic can be enjoyed without knowing much about how a computer works.\n\nFor your second point, see my response to kqr below. Personally, I think someone without an innate understanding of how computers work will have a very hard time appreciating algorithms. To you and me the purpose of algorithms may seem very obvious but to someone who is interested in real things or emotions might not get very excited over loops, branching and recursion since they can see no point to them.    this. http://www.laurenipsum.org/\n\n\"A story about computer science \nand other improbable things.\nLaurie is lost in Userland.

The first value, the request ID, is necessary so that the token can't be \"replayed\" or used by multiple people. The 32-byte hex value is probably a SHA-256 HMAC. The 32 byte hex value is probably a 32 byte hex value, is the most accurate guess any of us can give.  If you were assuming a HMAC, 32 bytes would be MD5, wouldn't it?

Type *traceroute www.reddit.com* in your console to see the \"hops\" your request makes. I know about traceroute, but as far as I know it doesn't show any specific protocols used.\nI guess that some protocols used by ISP's can't be shown this way (due to tunneling etc.). And these are the things that I wan't to know more about (OSFP, BGP, ...).\n Roughly speaking BGP (border gateway protocol) is how routers know which router to send a packet too (I am not a network guy so the following could all be wrong). Imagine a simple network... your home router connected to a router at your ISP. The ISP's router is also connected to two other routers... one that handles all of the US websites and one that handles the rest of the world (ROW). The ISP's router uses BGP to talk to the the US router and the ROW to acquire a map of which IP addresses each router handles. The list of IP addresses is a mix IP addresses and masks (eg. 205.0.0.0 and 255.0.0.0... means any IP address starting with 205).... not the full list of all known IP addresses. When one ISP installs a connection to another ISP (roughly speaking \"a phone line\") they reach an real world agreement to allow their routers to talk to each other using BSG (i.e. routers won't just accept BSG stuff from any old place). BSG is only involved at the \"border\" of two networks (i.e. where two ISP \"meet\"/\"share a connection\").\n\nSo... when you make a specific request BGP isn't actually directly involved. The ISP's routers (and routers around the world) have already initialized themselves and \"know\" how to route a packet.\n\nThe actual browser request is send via TCP/IP using the HTTP protocol to a specific IP address and port number. The protocol defines two standard/default ports... 80 for http: and 443 for https:.  The browser uses the DNS system to translate domain names into IP addresses). The protocol includes commands list \"GET\" (get the content of a specific resource), \"HEAD\" (get the header information of a specific resource), and so forth. In general the browser will do a \"GET\" on the resource and then subsequent \"GET\"s for images, scripts, style sheets, etc (whether a browser does a GET on additional resources is not part of the HTTP standard... it's part of the normal expected behavior of a browser). \n\nThe response from a webserver always starts with a headers a blank link and then a status line (eg. ignoring headers, something like \"200 OK\" or \"404 Not Found\"). Following the status line is the content of the requested resource (for GET's, other http commands may or may not actually send content).\n\nHeaders are used both when sending a request and receiving a request. They look like \"header name: header value\", and there's a raft of standard headers, each with specific purposes. \n\nFor more details on how the HTTP protocol works start with Wikipedia and then look at the related RFC documents.\n\nTo come back to your question about \"what happens when I write this post\"... it looks roughly like:\n\n1. The browser queries your computer for reddit.com's IP address\n2. If your computer knows the answer it provides it, otherwise your computer asks its configured DNS server (which in turn may ask other DNS servers).\n3. Your browser opens TCP/IP port 80 to reddit's IP address and issues a GET request for the \"/submit\" resource\n4. The webserver responds with a page of HTML\n5. Your browser issues additional GET requests to fetch images, style sheets, etc\n6. Your browser draws the page and shows it to you\n7. You fill out the form and click \"submit\"\n8. Your browser opens TCP/IP port 80 to reddit's ip address and issues a POST request to the \"/submit\" resource and includes all the data you filled out on the form.\n9. The webserver responds with a status of \"301 Redirect\" and a new url of \"/r/compsci/comments/uof28/what_happend_when_i_made_this_post_network/\"\n10. The browser knows that a 302 status means the webserver would like it to issue a GET request on the specified URL\n11. The browser does a GET request on \"/r/compsci/comments/uof28/what_happend_when_i_made_this_post_network/\" and displays the results to you (goto step 4)\n\nBehind all of the above is the low level routing work that routers do to ensure that a network packet addressed to IP x.x.x.x actually gets to IP address x.x.x.x. This generally involves between half a dozen or two dozen separate routers.  I know about traceroute, but as far as I know it doesn't show any specific protocols used.\nI guess that some protocols used by ISP's can't be shown this way (due to tunneling etc.). And these are the things that I wan't to know more about (OSFP, BGP, ...).\n ",

    "snippet" : "  I don't understand why we need w_i and k_i? Isn't the restriction just that e_i = k_i-w_i so all you need is a single value (say k_i) which must be equal to e_i? You're right. The data set I'm working from had both so I left it in the problem. That's a much nicer way to represent the problem! I'm also tempted to say there won't be a 'nice' representation for all sets of edges (finding just one might be more interesting).\n\nJust as an example, suppose all vertices had values (0,2) (using your original notation), except 2, say x and y, which have (0,1). Then obviously the only solutions are the paths from x to y. The problem is there are O(n!) of these, since the path can traverse the other vertices in any order.\n\nI imagine that in general this problem would have hopelessly unrepresentable solution sets.\n\nEDIT: Just realized this was r/compsci, not r/math.. heh. In that case, finding all edge sets is not polynomially computable, in which case if you're going to compute it at all, you may as well just check every edge set anyway.\n\n   Little background: As far as I know, I made this problem up (made the picture to try to explain it). I'm sure others have solved it before but I have been having a ton of trouble finding similar problems online. If anyone has any ideas for reformulating the problem s.t. it's easier to solve, I'd love to hear it! Any interesting (related) observations, algorithms, or analysis are very welcome! Why the integer pairs? This problem is more-or-less an adaptation of another problem. I should've simplified it further to just be one integer! I'm just not sure what the integer pairs serve. I'm no CS graduate though, just a programmer.\n\n Using single integer values is definitely better. This problem is actually just related to a chemistry problem I'm working on. The first number is the number of electrons and the second is the number of electrons required to complete a valence shell. This could've been simplified to the number of covalent bonds required for each atom (which I will certainly do now) - equivalent to the number of edges on the graph.  Now you just need to check if the molecules you generate are physically possible in three dimensions! (no easy task, that one) Haven't even gotten the generation down yet! But my next step is to calculate the appropriate angles, so maybe I'll just go for 3D! Any recommended references?  Sorry to reply in someone else's thread :)\n\n[Balloon](http://users.abo.fi/mivainio/balloon) is a nice program to generate 3D conformers from just the connectivity.\n\nIf you want to code it yourself, I'm not totally sure how - I've just finished doing some 2D layout stuff, which is hard enough. One approach might be to use Jmol's [minimize command](http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/#minimize) on a rough model, as it's quite nice to have a visual method.\n\nIn general, it's probably not necessary to get a chemically accurate 3D model, as that is quite a bit of work. A 3D 'sketch' model with unrealistic bond lengths (IE : edges) is probably fine for most things. Also, a crude model can then be refined by other software. Haven't even gotten the generation down yet! But my next step is to calculate the appropriate angles, so maybe I'll just go for 3D! Any recommended references?  As a computer scientist with just a bit of physics and chemistry knowledge, it is my impression that simply evaluating whether or not an arbitrary configuration is stable is a very hard problem within the realm of P. Chem. I'd start by searching for related work in physics/chemistry journals, restating the problem in a mathematical way (as you did in the OP), and then attempting to reduce the problem to a well-explored problem.

There's something I do not quite understand about your problem formulation:\n&gt; Find all sets of edges where w_i + e_i = k_i for every vertex in the graph\n\nDid you mean to say \"Find all sets of *vertices* where w_i + e_i = k_i\"? Going by your example, this appears to be the case.\n\nAssuming that, why not give each vertex a single integer L_i and look for all vertices that have e_i = L_i? Your original problem could be reduced to this by setting L_i = k_i - w_i.\n You're right, the problem should just be to find the set of graphs requiring a certain number of edges for each vertex. The usual formulation is that the set of integers {e_i} is a [degree sequence](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DegreeSequence.html). There is a theorem known as the [Havel-Hakimi theorem](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/61361/what-condition-need-to-be-imposed-on-havel-hakimi-theorem-to-check-for-connected) that gives you *a* graph (but not necessarily connected - see the link).\n\nI could mention that there are ways to generate *all possible* graphs given a degree sequence, but they are quite complicated, and I don't know of an efficient way to do so.

Basically you would define a number of polygons (e.g. one for each state) which are overlays on the map. When someone clicks anywhere within the polygon, you perform whatever action is required. See here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays#Polygons\n\n&gt;I wonder a method to solve this problem with high efficiency (for a website).\n\nIf it's not a Google Map you're using, but say an image, then you could use an image map and define your shapes using 'area' tags.

See here: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_area.asp\n\nMaybe I'm oversimplifying your problem - but make sure you're not reinventing the wheel here. If you're working with geographical coordinates then there is almost certainly an API or library or whatever that will do what you want. In fact, if what you're doing is for a web site then there probably is something out there that you can use instead of implementing it yourself.\n\nEDIT: if you don't have someone clicking, but want to find out for a coordinate which you get some other way, then you could use the method here http://alienryderflex.com/polygon/ which was also linked to by zhay.",

    "title" : "What skills do I need before tackling The Algorithm Design Manual?",
    "snippet" : "I’ve been reading a book called “How To Win At College” by Cal Newport of [Study Hacks](http://calnewport.com/blog/) fame. The book is broken up into a series of tips and tricks that are meant to ultimately lead one to greater success as a university student. One of the tips in the book is “Do something better than anyone you know.” I’ve decided that I want this skill to be the ability to solve algorithmic problems by applying algorithm theory to real-world problems and I’ve decided on The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena as my introduction to algorithms.\n\nWe all agree that computer science is not programming, but I believe a firm grasp on basic CS concepts can make anyone a better developer. This relationship is similar to that of a journalist who studies English. While a journalist can have a great career without studying English, there is certainly an argument that theory (English) is just as important as application (Journalism). For programmers, this is the difference between studying theoretical computer science (algorithms, data structures, AI, etc) and learning programming languages (Python, C, etc).\n\nMy goal is to become proficient at engineering optimized algorithms for solving real-world problems. This won’t happen by diving right into a book on algorithms and that is something that I fully understand. My question is this: What do I need to know before I start tackling The Algorithm Design Manual? To be a good algorithm designer one certainly needs to know how to analyze the time complexity of an algorithm. What math skills, specifically, are required to do this well? I’ve heard that going through a book on discrete mathematics would be a good idea. What else would you recommend? Statistics and probability, perhaps?   If you want a really thorough introduction to algorithms you should probably look at [CLRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). All the required math is explained in the appendix.\n\nStill, even with the explanations you will probably spend more time trying to get the proofs than actually learning algorithm design (because you might give up early).\n\nWorking through Skiena's book first is really not a bad idea. I've only glossed over it, but it seems he introduces all (or most of) the required math in a linear fashion building up your knowledge for algorithm analysis. On the other hand IIRC he glosses over many things such as thorough analysis of randomized algorithms.\nSo, I don't think you need much prior special math knowledge for Skiena's book. CLRS is much more of a reference book than Skiena's is. I'm sure it's a fantastic book, but I wouldn't consider using it as an actual introduction to the subject. Kleinberg and Tardos's book *Algorithm Design* is a better alternative if you're less interested in rigor and more in the intuition behind things. \n\nI'd actually recommend reading bits and pieces of CLRS, such as their intro to random variables and so forth. If you want more math, consider skimming at least the opening chapters of *Concrete Mathematics*.\n\nYou may want to get into programming contests. I learned more about computer science theory from that than all the classes I took. It's far from real-world application, but as a computer scientist it'll develop an enormous fraction of the skills you want to train. Everything from abstracting a problem to analyzing complexity and proving optimality. I think sites like TopCoder and Interview Street are what I'm looking for. I want to be good at taking problem statements and returning solutions, and that's what these sites are made for.\n\nEDIT: Would you recommend *Algorithm Design* before or after *The Algorithm Design Manual*?

Without making any kind of judgement on the greater point of the article...\n\n&gt; because the language is not narrowly designed towards a specific purpose like matrix manipulations or building operating systems.\n\nAfter my 16-or-so-years of programming experience, I've come to believe that a language having a specific purpose is a good thing in practice, as there really is no general-purpose programming language that could imaginably fit all areas where currently domain-specific languages are employed, without introducing a huge paradigm mismatch or reduce the language to use to the lowest common denominator (which often ends up being C.)\n\n&gt; Lisp is designed for representing symbols\n\nLisp can't even do basic symbolic computations &amp; manipulations (in a more practical way than any other turing-complete language can do it.) That there matrix manipulation language you scoffed at earlier actually [can...](http://www.mathworks.se/products/symbolic/)\n\n&gt; which means it’s capable of representing anything.\n\nDoes that even mean anything? I'm pretty sure that doesn't mean anything. &gt; as there really is no general-purpose programming language that could imaginably fit all areas where currently domain-specific languages are employed\n\nThat's what macros, metaprogramming, and language extension is for. Works well for various Lisps (Clojure, Racket, CL, etc.), Scala, and others.\n\n&gt; Lisp can't even do basic symbolic computations &amp; manipulations (in a more practical way than any other turing-complete language can do it.) That there matrix manipulation language you scoffed at earlier actually can...\n\nSure it can. You can find libraries to do these things in various Lisps. That said, I have no idea what \"representing symbols\" has to do with modern Lisp implementations.\n\n&gt; Does that even mean anything? I'm pretty sure that doesn't mean anything.\n\nNope. Maybe it's an allusion to how SICP chooses to represent everything using quoted s-expressions. Which is unfortunate because it's not pedagogically useful or useful in practice to think of everything as a list (note how real Lisp programs use objects, records, vectors, and so on). &gt; That's what macros, metaprogramming, and language extension is for. Works well for various Lisps (Clojure, Racket, CL, etc.), Scala, and others.\n\nThose are nice, but only address a very very tiny part of what makes up a special-purpose language, namely the syntax. You also want things like certain semantic properties, certain properties of the implementation etc etc. You could \"style\" your lisp dialect that way to resemble languages that are typically used to query databases or program micro-controllers, but that doesn't make it actually suitable to do the aforementioned tasks. Your database-macros will still be written in a language that doesn't make a lot of guarantees and hence can't be compiled to database queries efficiently, and your language implementation will still make it too big to fit into the ROM of a typical microcontroller.\n\n&gt; Sure it can. You can find libraries to do these things in various Lisps.\n\nYeah, but as I said, just like in any other language, nothing beyond that. The author of the article however seems to claim that this is somehow a particularly outstanding feature of lisp that gives it special powers. &gt; Those are nice, but only address a very very tiny part of what makes up a special-purpose language, namely the syntax. \n\nThat's not really true. For example, Racket's macro system is powerful enough to write a type system or a language with entirely different semantics (e.g., a lazy language, Algol, etc.) Clojure people are also trying to do something similar with types. Well, it's blurring the lines quite a bit between what constitutes writing a new language and extending the old one, but I think the problems I've raised will still apply regardless. To use it as a database query language, you need to have an efficient compiler that compiles it to primitives the database backend can understand anyway, and you probably don't want to tack an interpreter for a turing-complete language to your database. And the problem that you can't change the implementation properties won't go away regardless. Unless, that is, you make your program output assembly or something to that effect that decouples it from the original implementation -- but then you've effectively just implemented a compiler (which you also can do in any other language, and there are domain-specific tools for that as well that make it very convenient) &gt; Well, it's blurring the lines quite a bit between what constitutes writing a new language and extending the old one\n\nExactly.

That's what that homoiconic thing is about.\n\nThat was what I was trying to avoid, because then I'm not really using lisp anymore, I've implemented a compiler, so that doesn't really count (in my book, because I'd count that as domaine-specific language then). Certainly lisp is very well suited to do this kind of thing (implementing a domaine-specific language) but other languages can do it as well, really, so that's not really the outstanding feature the author originally purported lisp to have. What the author of the article implied was more along the lines \"domaine-specific languages are kinda obsolete, now that we have lisp\", (which I disagree with,) while you're arguing more along the lines \"lisp is an excellent language to implement domaine-specific languages\" (which I agree with, but there are others that are just as well-suited)\n\n(And also some domaine-specific languages will be impossible/impractical to implement in lisp, for instance you couldn't feasibly implement a basic dialect that's supposed to run on a microcontroller in lisp, because your runtime environment would be too large, and you wouldn't feasibly implement a language to program microcontrollers in lisp either, because that would basically require you to have a comprehensive knowledge on how to build a compiler (with efficient bytecode backend and all that), so instead you'd just use one of the existing ones (like C, ThingML or something like that, for instance) The point is that the distinction between languages and libraries is a false one, perpetuated by mainstream languages like Java. Saying that you aren't in Lisp (or any other language) because you have a DSL is a bit disingenuous.\n\nAnd other languages do do DSLs, but none as well as Lisp with its macros.\n\nObviously there are some scenarios Lisps or other \"high-level\" languages aren't suited for, but surely we're talking about the 99% use case here. &gt; The point is that the distinction between languages and libraries is a false one, perpetuated by mainstream languages like Java. Saying that you aren't in Lisp (or any other language) because you have a DSL is a bit disingenuous.\n\nWell, I draw the line when you start outputting code rather than just executing it. But regardless what interpretation you chose, what the original article claimed doesn't really hold up..\n\n&gt; And other languages do do DSLs, but none as well as Lisp with its macros.\n\nIf you want to make a DSL and compile it to something, outputting, say, assembly or so, there are others that do just as good or even better -- there are domaine-specific (hurr) languages that are made for just that, like compiler-compiler frameworks that allow you to just plop in a grammar and a few primitives you're basically good to go -- the rest is handled for you. (Can't really give any specific examples as I haven't really used these yet, but I believe a bunch of VMs/compiler frameworks come with these, like parrots PEG (or so) and llvm)\n\n&gt; Obviously there are some scenarios Lisps or other \"high-level\" languages aren't suited for, but surely we're talking about the 99% use case here.\n\nWell, the point of domaine-specific languages is already that they are used for that remaining 1%, for the other 99% you can use any general-purpose programming language whatsoever anyway. If you define it like that, you can claim that *any* general purpose programming language obsoletes all domaine-specific languages -- but that's not really the point. Well, it's blurring the lines quite a bit between what constitutes writing a new language and extending the old one, but I think the problems I've raised will still apply regardless. To use it as a database query language, you need to have an efficient compiler that compiles it to primitives the database backend can understand anyway, and you probably don't want to tack an interpreter for a turing-complete language to your database. And the problem that you can't change the implementation properties won't go away regardless. Unless, that is, you make your program output assembly or something to that effect that decouples it from the original implementation -- but then you've effectively just implemented a compiler (which you also can do in any other language, and there are domain-specific tools for that as well that make it very convenient) &gt; but then you've effectively just implemented a compiler (which you also can do in any other language, and there are domain-specific tools for that as well that make it very convenient)\n\nThat is what macros are. They are a controlled hook into the compiler with many convenient tools for manipulating syntax.\n Yeah, I wasn't really arguing against that, I was more arguing against that domaine-specific languages are obsoleted by using lisp (or that lisp is the only necessary tool to implement domaine-specific languages). (See my reply to sid0) Note: I don't disagree with you about the original article. It makes some bogus-sounding claims.\n\nLisps are certainly not the only (or necessary) tools for implementing DSLs. However, the point is that its language design happens to be particularly suited for DSLs. You could maybe say the same of Scala (and various other languages), but certainly not of, say, Java.\n\nAlso, I don't see why you're distinguishing between DSLs implemented in Lisp as opposed to anything else. In particular, this:\n\n&gt; Well, I draw the line when you start outputting code rather than just executing it.\n\ndoesn't make sense because macros do exactly that: *output code*. Macros are just transformations on syntax that hook into a particular compiler framework (i.e., the macro expander). Lisp macros definitely do not execute their input. Without making any kind of judgement on the greater point of the article...\n\n&gt; because the language is not narrowly designed towards a specific purpose like matrix manipulations or building operating systems.\n\nAfter my 16-or-so-years of programming experience, I've come to believe that a language having a specific purpose is a good thing in practice, as there really is no general-purpose programming language that could imaginably fit all areas where currently domain-specific languages are employed, without introducing a huge paradigm mismatch or reduce the language to use to the lowest common denominator (which often ends up being C.)\n\n&gt; Lisp is designed for representing symbols\n\nLisp can't even do basic symbolic computations &amp; manipulations (in a more practical way than any other turing-complete language can do it.) That there matrix manipulation language you scoffed at earlier actually [can...](http://www.mathworks.se/products/symbolic/)\n\n&gt; which means it’s capable of representing anything.\n\nDoes that even mean anything? I'm pretty sure that doesn't mean anything.",

    "title" : "Are all linear codes (as in coding theory) ideals/modules over some finite-dimensional algebra? (Or allow similar algebraic structure)",
    "snippet" : "It's known that cyclic codes are ideals over polynomial (quotient) rings R = F[x]/(x^n - 1), and this is a finite dimensional algebra over F (F being some finite field).\n\nWikipedia mentions some codes, called Linear codes, are vector spaces over a finite-fields, so let's restrict to those. Does every linear code allow an action by an algebraic structure (monoid/semigroup/algebra/etc.)?\n\nGoogling around yields fairly basic references, and sometimes cryptic ones. Wikipedia mentions that modular group-representation theory is used in coding theory, but without references. I would love to know if anyone can provide advanced references for coding theory from an abstract algebra point-of-view. Thank you.  I think you are arriving at modern representation theory in a very roundabout way.   A linear code is a subspace of a vector space of a finite field.  The full vector space is acted on transversely by GL(n, F_q).  You might get more results by looking for structures like Grassmanians and flag varieties and how they might relate to codes.  I would be very very surprised if such a general result exists since it seems like it would rely on a very large breakthrough in representation theory and algebraic geometry [Weil Conjectures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures).  (Though I'm no expert on coding theory and I'm certainly no expert in algebraic geometry).  You might find interesting results for subclasses of linear codes that aren't cyclic using some of the more modern techniques.  (Relating cyclic codes to ideals was modern in like the 50-60's) Thank you for this lovely answer. I'm actually hoping to study representation theory/algebraic geometry, I enter gradschool this September. \n\nI was actually motivated by a representation-theoretic theorem, a certain ''no-go'' theorem from the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras (or quiver theory). \n\nIt is known since the '80s that certain algebras have ''universal'' representation theories, in the sense that they contain a copy of the module category of any and all finitely-generated algebra. So if you could produce a classification of all their representations, this would yield one for all finitely-generated algebra in existence, a herculean task. Such algebras are called ''Wild'', the theorem in question is the Tame-Wild dichotomy.\n\nAn interesting fact is that Wild algebras are somewhat ubiquitous. For example, if you take a finite group G whose p-sylow subgroup is not cyclic, then the group algebra F_q[G] is Wild if p divides |G|. (q = p^k, p &gt; 3) This pretty much  makes classifying the representations of such groups over F_q unthinkable.\n\nI was thinking, if some families of codes were naturally identified with, say, representations of finite groups over F_q, then the Tame-Wild dichotomy theorem might have something interesting (or depressing) to say about coding theory.\n\n Check out this paper then.\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5547",

In an analog computer couldn't one actually USE base *e*?     As far as I know, on the software side nothing would really be different. Addresses and instructions would have to be in powers of 3 (or 4 or what have you) but nothing else would be any different (in fact since most of the time those things are referred to in hexadecimal anyway it is already as though the software runs in base 16)\n\nThe real difference would come in the math. Computers use a lot of shortcuts based around their binary nature, from bitshifting to boolean logic. Boolean logic in general would be completely meaningless, and that's the basic foundation of all arithmetic and logic in computers! It wouldn't be impossible, but an entirely new set of rules would have to be derived.

However there would be more precision required and more vulnerability to parasitic spikes so perhaps the logic level changes would have to be ramped more slowly.\n\nin summary the compiler changes would be easy, the chip changes would be harder, and as a computer user or programmer you would probably not be exposed to much difference if any.

I'd imagine that if we threw out binary that we'd have to throw out hexadecimal as well.\nWith a byte in binary, we might have values where the weight of the digits would be 8-4-2-1. I'd imagine that with ternary bits, the digit weight must be 27-9-3-1. In order to represent a byte in a single digit similar the functionality of hex, we would need to use a base large enough to support 80 different values, if my math is right. &gt; In order to represent a byte in a single digit similar the functionality of hex, we would need to use a base large enough to support 80 different values, if my math is right.\n\nI think you mean \"nibble\" instead of byte there, fwiw. And though we might need 80 (or 81) distinct digits for a four-trit representation, there's no reason to use four trits. Or, for that matter, straight ternary.\n\nIf we instead use balanced ternary, the largest four-trit value is 1,1,1,1, which is (1+3+9+27) or 40. Unfortunately, that's still more than decimal numbers + alphabet.\n\nSo take the largest three-trit value in balanced ternary: 1,1,1. That's 1+3+9, or 13, which we can easily represent as C in triskadecimal (0-9ABC).\n\nOf course, in balanced ternary, you can also have negative numbers. So the smallest number in three trits isn't 0, it's -1,-1,-1, or (-9-3-1), or -13. Fortunately, since it's balanced, we don't need an additional digit symbol. Unfortunately, we do need some way of indicating subtractive values if triskadecimal is to work.\n\nLet's take the number 400. In balanced ternary, that's 1,-1,-1,0,-1,1,1. In triskadecimal, that would be 1 -B -5. Or, perhaps, 1~~B5~~. Or we could use underlines or overlines. In any case, it should be doable.\n\nTriskadecimal is less capable of making English words (a la 0xDEADBEEF), but would be well-suited as a compact representation of balanced ternary.\n\nIf we go with non-balanced ternary, it's a different story. The highest three-trit value is 222, or (2+6+18), or 26. Again, we can do this with numbers and letters: 0-9A-P. Not ideal, since it includes both 0 and O, but doable.\n\nAnd both representations are more efficient than hexadecimal. Non balanced ternary could skip numerals completely, and just use A-Z.  No problem with 0 vs O then. disagree that boolean logic would be affected by this in any way shape or form.\n\nThe c convention that 0 means false and anything else means true would not be affected by anything.\n\nBoolean logic i.e. everything being either TRUE or FALSE would not change, so all the logic structures in programmes would be the same.\n\nAll numbers would now be in base 3, so bitshifting would change (it would still be a valid operation except it would now multiple/divide the number by 3. \n\nCurrent code that assumes bitshifting works on powers of two would remain identical however compilers would be translating it into trinary/ternary arithmetic under the hood.\n\nThe biggest thing that would be different would be the transistors inside chips.

I was more referencing how actual logic gates would no longer have any meaning. A physical AND gate makes sense for boolean logic, but in ternary logic, what is 1 AND 2? In C and other languages that use 0 = false other = true, there would be no change. Logic gates could operate using the same principle, but since all arithmetic operations depend on logic gates, this would mess those up. You would end up needing new ways to construct the arithmetic and logic circuits.  disagree that boolean logic would be affected by this in any way shape or form.\n\nThe c convention that 0 means false and anything else means true would not be affected by anything.\n\nBoolean logic i.e. everything being either TRUE or FALSE would not change, so all the logic structures in programmes would be the same.\n\nAll numbers would now be in base 3, so bitshifting would change (it would still be a valid operation except it would now multiple/divide the number by 3. \n\nCurrent code that assumes bitshifting works on powers of two would remain identical however compilers would be translating it into trinary/ternary arithmetic under the hood.\n\nThe biggest thing that would be different would be the transistors inside chips. There would be a lower noise margin inside the mosfets (you would have two forbidden regions in trinary/ternary and smaller acceptable value ranges). \n\nThis could actually increase the achievable clockspeed as the propagation delay could be a little smaller if it has to move the voltage less to register a logic value change. However there would be more precision required and more vulnerability to parasitic spikes so perhaps the logic level changes would have to be ramped more slowly.\n\nin summary the compiler changes would be easy, the chip changes would be harder, and as a computer user or programmer you would probably not be exposed to much difference if any. &gt; There would be a lower noise margin inside the mosfets (you would have two forbidden regions in trinary/ternary and smaller acceptable value ranges).\n\nHow feasable would it be to use balanced ternary, with +1 at +1.8V (or whatever your logic high is), 0 at 0V, and -1 at -1.8V ? Well that would not be any different from calling it 0, 1.8, 3.6v. So either you have a 3.6v range with roughly the same size noise margin as before (but higher power consumption, propagation time?), or if you implemented it with a range of 1.8v then you would be required to have something like half the noise margin. I had assumed the latter in my post but perhaps you would need to go down the route you describe.  The word is ternary, not trinary. And it's been done. By Russian mathematicians. In 1958.

There's no calculation it can do that binary can't, nor any calculation it can do better. It's just that converting between binary and ternary isn't quite as clean as between binary and quaternary.

The bits (or for this trits) allocated for the number are split up into two, with one part holding the significant digits and one holding the exponent:\n\nSignificant digits × base ^ exponent\n\nBoth the numbers are stored as integers, so they would follow the convention above.

You'd just have integers. What's wrong with two's complement?  Sure you have to wrap your head around it, but it works beautifully.

In traditional Trinary logic it seems like it is used for 'indeterminate', but that's not useful.  On the other hand, if we could keep binary logic on a three-valued circuit, are there efficiencies to see from that?  That's at least part of what I'm asking. Trinary? Powers of 3?

(However assembly code might change but its not portable so thats fine). nothing would change there. However the implementation under the hood would be less efficient, as it would be implementing binary bitshift on a trinary system. In fact if we were going to switch over, its possible that processors might include a binary bitshift operator to keep performance of existing code at a reasonable level.\n\nyep I agree performance would be worse for a lot of algorithms that assume base 2. My guess is compatibility with existing software etc would be a nightmare. Plenty of code hardwires the binary assumption, with \" &lt;&lt; 3\" being shorthand for \"*8' etc. \n\nSo, even if you ported a C compiler, and even if you recompiled existing binaries, I think logic errors would appear.        Since nobody has answered your last question, you couldn't use C or C++.  Both of them require numbers to be in binary, so low-level work would be rather inefficient.  You'd need a new low-level language that has ternary primitives built into the language. I'd propose extending C++ by adding in ternary operators (call it C+++), the compiler would have to translate binary ones to ternary but that is doable. &gt; extending\n\n[Not possible](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/udsyt/how_hard_would_it_be_to_build_a_computer_and_a/c4uskmb).  You could write a different but similar C++-like language, but it wouldn't be backwards compatible and so wouldn't be an extension. Since nobody has answered your last question, you couldn't use C or C++.  Both of them require numbers to be in binary, so low-level work would be rather inefficient.  You'd need a new low-level language that has ternary primitives built into the language. I'm not sure i follow. They're both languages built with an assumption of binary representations, but nothing in them requires it.\n\nExisting software would probably need to be changed, though. From the C standard, section 6.2.6.1.3:\n\n&gt; Values stored in unsigned bit-fields and objects of type unsigned char shall be\nrepresented using a pure binary notation.^40\n\n&gt; 40) A positional representation for integers that uses the binary digits 0 and 1, in which the values\nrepresented by successive bits are additive, begin with 1, and are multiplied by successive integral\npowers of 2, except perhaps the bit with the highest position. (Adapted from the American National\nDictionary for Information Processing Systems.) A byte contains CHAR_BIT bits, and the values of\ntype unsigned char range from 0 to 2^CHAR_BIT − 1.\n\nAnd again, from section 6.2.6.2:\n\n&gt; 1. For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, the bits of the object\nrepresentation shall be divided into two groups: value bits and padding bits (there need\nnot be any of the latter). If there are N value bits, each bit shall represent a different\npower of 2 between 1 and 2^(N-1), so that objects of that type shall be capable of\nrepresenting values from 0 to 2^N − 1 using a pure binary representation; this shall be\nknown as the value representation. The values of any padding bits are unspecified.\n\n&gt; 2. For signed integer types, the bits of the object representation shall be divided into three\ngroups: value bits, padding bits, and the sign bit. There need not be any padding bits;\nthere shall be exactly one sign bit. Each bit that is a value bit shall have the same value as\nthe same bit in the object representation of the corresponding unsigned type (if there are\nM value bits in the signed type and N in the unsigned type, then M ≤ N ). If the sign bit\nis zero, it shall not affect the resulting value. If the sign bit is one, the value shall be\nmodified in one of the following ways:\n\n&gt;    * the corresponding value with sign bit 0 is negated (sign and magnitude);\n&gt;    * the sign bit has the value −(2^N ) (two’s complement);\n&gt;    * the sign bit has the value −(2^N − 1) (ones’ complement).\n\n&gt;     Which of these applies is implementation-defined, as is whether the value with sign bit 1\nand all value bits zero (for the first two), or with sign bit and all value bits 1 (for ones’\ncomplement), is a trap representation or a normal value. In the case of sign and\nmagnitude and ones’ complement, if this representation is a normal value it is called a\nnegative zero.\n\nThe C++ standard has similar language in it.\n\nThere's no reason C or C++ code couldn't run in a virtual machine, but virtual machines are pretty terrible at low-level work, so you'd need a different language for that.",

Certainly there are, if I'm understanding you. Upper bounds on running time are for algorithms, not problems. There are plenty of problems where we haven't proven that the best available algorithm is optimal. Matrix multiplication is a good (and kind of topical) example (see http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/a-breakthrough-on-matrix-product/).

How do you show that an O(nlogn) bound for sorting is attainable without explicitly showing an algorithm?  The proofs I'm aware of just show a lower bound, and then use merge sort to show the bound is attainable.  But just showing a lower bound is not enough, since you could also say that O(1) is trivially a lower bound on sorting. Computer science students usually learn this in an analysis of algorithms course.  There's a great wikipedia article on [comparison based sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort).  The basic idea of the proof is to show that the number of comparisons necessary to obtain the  required information about the proper order of the elements is, in the worst case, always O(n lg n).  This is commonly done by sketching out a decision tree, and showing that a tree that makes a sufficient number of decisions to sort the elements must have hight of \\Omega(n lg n).  This approach to the proof is sketched out [here](http://oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/courses/cs404/lecture09.pdf). Sorry, I think my notation was confusing, but the it seems like proof shows that a sorting algorithm must be \\Omega(n lg n), not that a sorting algorithm that's O(n lg n) exists. Ahh, I completely see that now reading the original question more carefully.  You're asking if there is an existence proof of an O(n lg n) sorting algorithm that does not include the algorithm which, itself, attains that bound.  I'm not aware of any such proof, but I'd be interested in seeing one.",

Coding is tricky enough to begin with, and we don't need /your/ super brain trying to make it any harder.\" My God, this is 90% of my programming philosophy in a single quote. Nice one. \"Don't try and be tricky. Coding is tricky enough to begin with, and we don't need /your/ super brain trying to make it any harder.\" I think I'm going to write this down and look at it everytime I sit down to code something.    This was after one of our professors got extremely ill and another had to fill in teaching his classes. \n&gt;So I didn't expect to have to teach this class until next year so I'm not really sure what I'm doing.

It was in our Functional Languages and Parsing class and I was only half paying attention without any real clue what was going on and he asked what the next step was and awkwardly stared at me. I responded with \"Just mod that\"\n&gt; ha...*Awkward silence and creepy stare*. No. So, did anyone get to leave early? Yeah the one kid who made a game that was essentially checkers but with frogs that had M1000s attached to them for some reason.\n\nHe was also the same kid who said to always pick a female character in your MMOs because you're going to be constantly staring at their backend. \n\n Yeah the one kid who made a game that was essentially checkers but with frogs that had M1000s attached to them for some reason.\n\nHe was also the same kid who said to always pick a female character in your MMOs because you're going to be constantly staring at their backend. \n\n  Yay Portland!

CS in high school. Sounds amazing. Haha, sort of. I went to a magnet school in north Jersey. I was technically enrolled in a computer science \"academy\" thing there, but really none of the teachers were particularly good or really knew what they were talking about, and the classes went at a pace that anyone could pretty easily surpass by self-teaching. It wasn't until my senior year that I had a teacher that actually knew their stuff (he was an ex-stanford professor, and the guy the quote's from), and he wasn't even officially cs (he was in the math dept.). But those classes I took senior year were really good.\n\nedit: spelling (**stand**ford) I don't know how they ever managed to get hard drives to work inside a magnet school.    \"The problem with Computer Science, is Computers\"\n-Programming Abstractions Prof.\n\n\"Oh No!
