    "snippet" : "On another thread (http://redd.it/17es51) I started to get an idea of how an AnCap society would use private institutions such as insurance, reputation brokers, and charities to provide the services and infrastructure such a community would need to function. Some of them surprised me a little (criminal investigation insurance, for example), because they never occurred to me.\n\nGiven that the sidewalk or road outside my front-door would be privately owned (let's also say I don't have a front yard, for simplicity), and that this owner reserves the right to deny access if I don't satisfy his requirements, what would I likely need to have before I can set foot outside my home?\n\nSo far I think I'd need:\n\n   * A form of identification recognized by the sidewalk owner\n   * Health and personal liability insurance\n   * Immunizations against common infectious diseases\n   * Criminal investigation insurance\n   * An account with a reputation broker and a score above a certain threshold\n   * Party to a contract--implicit or explicit--to abide by the laws of the private law enforcement agency employed by the sidewalk owner\n   * Advance knowledge of what the sidewalk owner considers acceptable/unacceptable behavior\n\nAnd not required, but prudent:\n\n   * A donation to a charity that would help me if I became victim to something not covered by the above\n\n Is this too much? Too little?  Understandably, you're making the mistake of trying to transplant what cities currently look like under a state into a stateless society. There's no reason to believe that they would look the same.  Secondly, that list is nothing compared to all of the things you're paying for under a state. You're literally paying for things all over the world. The state just consolidates it all for you and gives it a catch-all name. There would be nothing stopping people from offering the service of bill consolidation, which would probably also include finding you the cheapest rates. Does that mean an AnCap society would necessarily require a blank slate? If we abolished the United States today and replaced it with AnCap, wouldn't all the cities continue to look the same as they do now for a long time? Big cities like New York would no doubt look the same for a long time since they would be stuck with that inefficient infrastructure, but I personally believe that with a lack of central planning, things would be more spread out and less cramped. The most important part of my reply though is the second point I made.  &gt; The most important part of my reply though is the second point I made.\n\n Not contested.\n\n&gt; Big cities like New York would no doubt look the same for a long time since they would be stuck with that inefficient infrastructure, but I would imagine that people would start spreading out and forming unique communities which look completely different than what we're used to.\n\n Given infinite land? \n\n Okay, I'm suddenly conscious of being the troll I feared. Ahm... okay, dunno how to reassure my open mindedness, so here goes:\n\n What's left but Death Valley? http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/map-owns_the_west.jpg\n\nThe west and alaska Ah... er... well I suppose. Erm... what's habitable? I mean, what's realistically homesteadable? The caption to that map suggests that the red areas are a bit pie-chartish per state, that the borders are not real borders but fictions to represent percentages.\n\nWhat parts aren't shit? You think the gubmint takes the shit parts? I guess you got me.\n\nSo all the national parks I used to enjoy hiking will become ghettoes or apartment complexes, then? About 40% would yes  The sidewalk would likely be owned and maintained by the community that runs it IMO. If it was privately owned maybe the owner would just bill homeowners yearly or something.  The sidewalk would likely be owned and maintained by the community that runs it IMO. If it was privately owned maybe the owner would just bill homeowners yearly or something.   Capitalism simplifies our lives, it doesn't make them more complex. You'll probably have to be a member of just one company (of many) to gain access to most services. Agreed!  In the US I can use any ATM, and don't have to negotiate the deal - my credit union has done that for me. And so on.\n\nI can easily see the sidewalk owner bundling up his property with Neighborhood Inc and letting them do the billing.\n\nWhich in turn would create _more_ jobs - the sidewalk owner is going to use a 3rd party to audit the books.\n &gt;create more jobs \n\nCareful. Creating jobs isn't the point of an economy; satisfying consumers is.  Sounds like a real great society to live in. :/ Most of these things already apply to daily life in the western world. \n\n* A form of identification recognized by the sidewalk owner\n* Health and personal liability insurance\n* Immunizations against common infectious diseases\n* Party to a contract--implicit or explicit--to abide by the laws of the private law enforcement agency employed by the sidewalk owner\n* Advance knowledge of what the sidewalk owner considers acceptable/unacceptable behavior\n\n\nJust replace \"sidewalk owner\" with \"the state\".  Not true at all regarding the first 3; the last 2 are basically the same thing.  Really? What can you do without, at the very very least, one and three? Who will hire you, legally, without identification? If you get pulled over? Your children certainly won't be able to go to school without number three, and you won't be able to go to college.  I believe we were talking about \"going outside ones door\", not gaining employment etc.  you can't have a door without identification\n\nedit: legally Really? What can you do without, at the very very least, one and three? Who will hire you, legally, without identification? If you get pulled over? Your children certainly won't be able to go to school without number three, and you won't be able to go to college.  Not true at all regarding the first 3; the last 2 are basically the same thing.  Sounds like a real great society to live in. :/  I think it's more reasonable to think sidewalks would either belong to the road owners or property owners along the road, and they are open to the public by their nature. And you are still under the jurisdiction of the common law, and there's no reason to assume any different rules unless they are posted (perhaps a sign). \n\nInsurance is a good idea, but not necessary to own. If you are in a situation where you need a service, you should be able to purchase it at full cost or credit. \n\nYou would likely need the appropriate identification and licenses for some services, but you wouldn't *need* them for everyday, normal life. Going to the grocery store wouldn't warrant much.  often when I find the best response to an ancap question, you are the one providing it.   Sidewalk outside my house is privately owned.  I don't need any of those things.  I'm responsible for shoveling the section in front of my house if it snows a lot.   ...that's about it.\n\nNot only that, but you are more than welcome to walk down that sidewalk as well, even though you are not a member of the community. In the linked thread, the one about \"Typhoid Mary\", some of the responses to the problem of an asymptomatic infectious disease carrier was that private land owners would simply deny them access to their property in order to create a de-facto quarantine.\n\nAfter probing that a little further, one of the elaborations is that property owners would require identification (so they know who's a carrier), catastrophic health and personal liability insurance (in case something happened on their land and they needed to claim expenses), and possibly also an immunization record if they were in favor of cultivating herd immunity benefits.\n\nLandowners would need this because of the \"boxed in\" problem: once they discovered a Typhoid Mary they would presumably evict her, but all of the neighbors won't let her cross over to their property because of risk of contagion or because the next landowner en-route would deny access and trap them. Somebody would be left holding the hot potato.\n\nIf your community does let someone use their sidewalk without proof of ID, insurance, etc., and they got boxed in, and they were uninsured and unable to pay you for contaminating your property, then what happens?\n\nThe other thread has a lot of discussion on that, but I wanted to summarize it. Those discussions were where I first learned that property owners would have to use area-denial to deal with the problem of undocumented/uninsured/unemployed trespassers.   That sounds like a fairly complete list.  I guess the way to think about it is to ask, when you are on a sidewalk in a statist community, what services do you expect the society to provide you?  Those services, if you want them must be privately provided.  The information the state routinely collects about you (minus the parts related to taxes) to administer these services would probably be tied to your reputation, but you might not need any identification other than a way to verify your reputation (like you do when you use a credit card to buy something).\n\nSo, to be clear:  You do not *have to have* a DRO (which probably deals with your reputation, criminal investigation, and related things) or the other things listed, but if you do not you are personally responsible for all of those things (and the possible consequences).  It is usually cheaper to have a division of labor and allow economies of scale make the services cheap.\n\nThe specific rules for the sidewalk are up to who owns it.  It might be that you own it as a co-op with the others in your neighborhood (as has been suggested in other comments).  It is not terribly far fetched to think your landlord owns the sidewalk (to guarantee access to the property). DRO? DRO?  I imagine there would be service providers that consolidate a lot of this shit into one package based on your needs. That's fine, but is the above list a realistic idea of what those services would be aggregating?   Why do you think that *you* would not be a shareholder in the local \"sidewalks &amp; roadways corp\"?  Maybe I can't afford it. Then how did you afford your home? You don't think that purchasing a home would include a membership in the ownership structure for the sidewalks and roads that connect to it? Why not? And if you can afford a home, certainly you can afford to maintain it (one would hope), and maintaining *access* is, in this schema, a part of maintaining the home itself. \n\n\"Maybe I rent.\" \n\nThen your *landlord* is a shareholder, and as his tenant, his access rights pass on to you.\n\n\"Maybe I don't want to be a shareholder.\" \n\nSo, you pay a subscription fee that represents the costs of affording you access to property you don't have rights to. \n\nCertainly it would be cheaper in the long run to purchase a membership, so there is no profit-seeking motive in the provision of your rights. Consider that if the *users* can also be *owners*, then the corporation would only seek profit from *user, non-owners*, because otherwise they'd be profiting from themselves, and then redistributing that profit back to themselves, incurring a management expense along the way, and it would simply make more sense (e.g. be more financially efficient) *not* to seek profit from user-owners.\n\nA big difference between poverty and wealth is the ability to see that paying more now often reduces your costs down the road. Poor people buy for immediate needs, wealthy people plan for long-term needs.\n\nSure, a single roll of toilet paper is cheaper than the twelve pack, but the twelve pack provides greater value per use. In the same way, buying membership would cost more than a simple subscription, but provide long-term value.  &gt; Then how did you afford your home? You don't think that purchasing a home would include a membership in the ownership structure for the sidewalks and roads that connect to it?\n\n No, I mean, what if I were a _child_?\n\n I'd have to be lucky enough to be born into sufficient wealth, right? If you were a child, then your access would be afforded by your parents. If you're an orphan, you're dependent on charity, and nothing has changed from how things are today.\n\n&gt;I'd have to be lucky enough to be born into sufficient wealth, right?\n\nPlease directly state the point you would like to make. Disadvantaged persons exist in *all* methods of social organization.  &gt; If you're an orphan, you're dependent on charity, and nothing has changed from how things are today.\n\n True. But I could visit a park. Nonsequitor.  Back to the ghetto, then. No, I just can't help you if all you're going to spout are nonsequitors, like \"But I could visit a park\".      If i was the road owner, I would offer several options.\n\n1. one time charge of $1,000,000 per hour - no documentation\n2. monthly unlimited access of $1 billion - no documentation\n3. one time charge of $10 per hour - full documentation\n4. monthly unlimited access of $100 - full documentation You would build a road to charge people amounts that no one would pay? What's stopping you right now from making the best sandwich shop and charging 10,000$? Oh that's right you would go bankrupt. My property, my rules. If you don't like my product or services, then take your business elsewhere.\n\njust so we're clear though, I give people a substantial discount for following my rules. If they don't want to follow my rules, I'm not willing to accept liability for having them on my property. For example, would you allow a known drunk driver on your road? That's fine. I'm saying no one would pay those fees. The $10/hr or the $100/monthly fee? You haven't seen my roads, they're very nice. I don't allow any bad people on my roads and you're assured that you'll be safe. That seems worth $100/month. Value is subjective. I'll just take the cheaper road. You'll be back though, because you'll see those other roads a jammed packed with people looking for a cheaper alternative. These bargain hunter drivers are also more likely to not maintain their car and insurance.\n\nI just cater to a higher clientele. People that drive on my roads feel like a king. Think of it like buying starbucks coffee rather than a cheaper alternative. &gt;You'll be back though, because you'll see those other roads a jammed packed with people looking for a cheaper alternative.\n\nDo you know how supply and demand works? If someone sees a high demand for something like bread, people will start making more bread. So what you're saying is that nobody will ever buy expensive bread? My local grocery store has artisan breads, selling for over $5 for a small loaf. I don't think you're factoring in the convenience and exclusivity a business can have in a niche market.\n\nBack to roads. I would kill to pay $100/month to have no traffic and no hassles. You would build a road to charge people amounts that no one would pay? What's stopping you right now from making the best sandwich shop and charging 10,000$? Oh that's right you would go bankrupt. ",

    "snippet" : "  A corrupt officer is not a hero, he is still extorting people, the difference being he extorts the money for himself rather than defers it to the state.   Which, granted may provide the victims better service, but is still criminal.\n\nI also disagree about using the state.  Supporting taxes is wrong, but cooperating with the state is not always.  My friend is a serial entrepreneur, and he tried start-up after start-up after start-up, and over the years some have been successful, and others not.  But the point is, sometimes lots of perfectly good companies would be driven into the dirt because of taxes, regulations, or directly due to how the government was mucking with the economy.   After getting trounced half a dozen times, and having a hard time making it, then an opportunity pops up that is cooperative thing with the government - well what is he supposed to do, stop breathing?  \n\nI look at it more from a dependency perspective.   If you are not a criminal, but end up through circumstances depending on criminals.  That is not wrong, but it is extremely unwise.   When in that kind of a situation, it is in your best interest to be intellectually honest about what's going on, and to find ways to not rely on them.   It is not always immoral, but is often unwise.  I'm not so sure about this. Shouldn't we also consider services like taking money, since those services take money to provide? What is the limiting principle here? Am I not allowed to take student loans from government? Am I not allowed to get food stamps or drive on roads? \n\nI don't feel bad about taking government services and money, because my assumption is I'll pay more into the system than I get out.   We are all complicit in the state, whether we accept public money or not. You point it out yourself. If we were all somehow already independent of the state, I would agree with you. But since they already have us in their web, I see no problem with taking it for all it's worth.  I think you have a choice of whether or not you're in their web. You choose (like me) to submit because it makes your life easier. ",

    "title" : "How do I rebuttal this argument?",
    "snippet" : "I was explaining voluntary society to a statist, and explaining that it cannot happen overnight. Her fallback was that some people will always be evil, and I explained ostracism and how those people will be shunned from society. She insists that people will still be evil and try to get all the evil people to take over. I explained that is how government forms. How do I explain this better for these sheep statists?   I don't think it's fair for you to call her a sheep. She's raised a valid question that you didn't know the answer to, so that makes you a sheep to anarcho-capitalism.\n\nThe answer to the question is that we need a large enough group to resist the statists. I mentioned the possibilities in another comment last week:\n\n1. Over-time a free market will be more productive and have more advanced technology. So while an invading army might have tanks, we'll have lazers.\n2. With no central leadership, it's impossible for any invader to ever truly conquer an ancap society. This is what is happening in Afghanistan, where the US can never really defeat the population.\n3. Assassination politics means that an ancap society would likely target the leadership of the statist society. It's usually only the political and business leaders that want war in a statist society, so if these few provocateurs are killed or discouraged, then the entire state will not move towards war.\n4. Over-time, people will appreciate and migrate to a free society. There are only so many lies people will believe from a state government and once people see that an ancap society is possible, they will more than likely wish to join it over other types of society.\n &gt;I don't think it's fair for you to call her a sheep. She's raised a valid question that you didn't know the answer to, so that makes you a sheep to anarcho-capitalism.\n\nA statement perfectly summarizing an issue that is not given nearly enough consideration. It's fine to walk away from a debate admitting you don't know something and the possibility you might have something wrong. You should relish the opportunity to learn more and if you have something wrong, to make it right. If you aren't willing to entertain the possibility your philosophy or understanding of economics might be flawed, that philosophy is almost certainly worthless. A philosophy you are able to openly and constantly question, is one almost certainly of a higher caliber.  &gt;rebuttal\n\nrefute*\n\nIf her only argument is that people are bad, then you need to point out where these bad people congregate. Surely those who hunger for control will head where such control is obtainable. What better place than in government?\n\nA business run by \"evil\" people (be *very* careful how evil is defined here) is not going to remain a business for long, while a government run by evil people can manipulate its populace with virtually no consequences as demonstrated consistently throughout history and even today.\n\nIf she has disagreements on what constitutes \"evil\", then the task of explaining anarchism and free markets becomes much more difficult.\n\nHere are two relevant quotes:\n\n&gt;\"If men are good, you don't need government; if men are evil or ambivalent, you don't dare have one.\" - *Robert LeFevre*\n\n&gt;\"Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.\" - *Edward Abbey*      ",

Clearly this is 100% necessary, justifiable, and completely normal. So just, uh, go with it. Lol.\n\nThis really just confuses me. Why are people okay with this, how can anyone think this is normal? I'm just.... like... at a loss for words on this one.\n\nI think I have met my limit for media today, in just a few articles. &gt;how can anyone think this is normal?\n\nAs an infantry vet with experience overseas I can tell you this is not fucking normal by any means. Every military base has land designated as training area, for both live fire and blank fire exercises. We have two entire base facilities that are designated solely for mission-specific training (JRTC at Ft. Polk, Louisiana, and NTC at Ft. Irwin, California). There are tens of thousands of acres nationally for just this purpose. There is absolutely no reason for this to be going on. As a mechanic vet, this guy is right about there being training areas.\n\nHowever, you can't intimidate a population in to submission if you don't do these kinds of exercises. &gt;how can anyone think this is normal?\n\nAs an infantry vet with experience overseas I can tell you this is not fucking normal by any means.

They have these training grounds, but I believe none of them can simulate an urban highly populated area. So maybe that is the reason?\n\nWith some reasoning being put forward that links to \"oversea drills\" they might be preparing for some stuff.

I've considered for several years encouraging a boycott of his content for several reasons, but it seems that he's doing everyone a favor by slowly ostracizing himself.\n\nP.S. Probably the only reason he hasn't blog-spammed your videos is because you haven't put up a CC-license. There is no CC license on them because Youtube doesn't allow commercialization of CC licensed content(or if it does then there's a lot of hassle involved with it), and we need to commercialize it(put ads on it for revenue) because of the investment which goes into it(equipment and labor).

I personally prefer the term 'Praxeology' over 'Austrian Economics', because \n\na) it avoids stupid arguments with economists\n\nb) it goes way past Austrian economics and inter personal interaction of material goods\n\nI have retreated from the political side of it and these days I'm busy exploring the intrapersonal side of Praxeology. I believe that these principles which we tout as 'libertarianism' not just make a society happier, but even in a non-free society, when applied by an individual to his own mind would make him a lot more happy and prosperous.

He's right - it is his subreddit, and he's within his rights to ban me (and the dozens of others he's banned). But what's his goal? If it's to foster real discussion and debate on the topic and to build the movement, then I would argue that his policy is counterproductive and damaging (regardless of my individual ban - I've criticized his policy before this). If, however, he's just trying to control things and advance his own interests, then this may be the correct move.\n\nIf that's the case, then I think it's unfortunate for all of us. He's got prime subreddit real estate, and he leveraged that into a mod spot at r/economics as well. He also redirected a great domain name to that subreddit.

Deal with it.\n\n&gt; What facts ever leaned on \"rediculous\". \n\nHe deleted a post because the poster called an idea posed by Carl Menger \"crazy.\" It *was* crazy. I then questioned the deletion, saying that the idea was indeed crazy, and that the entire paragraph in question had been absurd. He banned me from the subreddit for calling an absurd idea (an idea that is directly contradicted by empirical reality) absurd. That's ridiculous. Yep, rIdiculous, not rEdiculous.\n\n&gt; Pointing out an angry man, is not an accusation, but rather fact. \n\nYou accused me of supporting child abuse without evidence.

I don't dislike Molyneux because of anything having to do with spanking, and following me into other threads to repeat your meme is just childish. Woosh. Spanked kid becomes angry on the internet, more news soon.  I'm not telling you to fuck off because I'm angry, but because you think the only reason anyone could dislike Molyneux (or, for some reason, you) is because of child abuse. Your vulgar ways are just a symptom from your wounds. Dont be surprised when more people drop you.  You are why people acuse molyneux of having a cult. You hear him say something then parrot it in completely different circumstances. People who were raised peacefully can still get mad.

Do you think you've achieved that in this thread? Get used to it, pro spanking groups will be banned from most thing in the future, especially the ones who cant see aggression on kids(spanking), cant even see their own aggressions in normal life.   What the hell are you talking about? Are you suggesting that I (who also got banned for the above posted interchange) am pro spanking? Please be careful how you sling these insults around. You know not who you condemn. Not sure about you, but Matticus_Rex is definitely wounded. \n\n\nAnd you should watch yourself too of what sociopaths you protect, times change quick.  A normal person would apologize here for insulting me. Do you think that's an unreasonable request? &gt; A normal person would apologize here for insulting me.\n\nI am sorry, when did I insult you? I started the comment thread in /r/austrian_economics that resulted in both myself and Matticus_Rex getting banned. You said \"Get used to it, pro spanking groups will be banned from most thing in the future\", which I took to mean that you were implying that the people who get banned from /r/austrian_economics are part of a pro-child abuse group, and/or are in favor of aggression in their own life. Since I was one of the targets of Nielsio's recent bans, I can only assume that you were referring to me as well.\n\nYou may not have had me in mind when you said it, but nevertheless you decided to collectivize when you made your statement, and you seemed to unnecessarily lump together everyone who gets banned there under the banner of \"pro aggression\". I take that personally.\n\nThank you for the apology, by the way. &gt; I started the comment thread in /r/austrian_economics that resulted in both myself and Matticus_Rex getting banned.\n\n\nBig shot rex forgot to put any detail, only relying on his stardom. How was I supposed to know about you?\n\n\n&gt; I take that personally.\n\n\nI only vouched for rexy and nobody else, and he proved everything I had against him and more. \n\n\n&gt; Thank you for the apology, by the way.\n\nSure. ;) Please don't talk about Matticus_Rex in this thread. I am trying to discuss my feelings with you, and I would appreciate if you didn't steer the conversation away from that topic.\n\nI do not like being winked at by the person who is supposedly apologizing for insulting me. &gt; Please don't talk about Matticus_Rex in this thread. I am trying to discuss my feelings with you, and I would appreciate if you didn't steer the conversation away from that topic.\n\n\nIt is very relevant. I knew an angry guy (rex) who started a public thread with out evidence, and told me to get over it because he is a big shot after swearing his guts out. \n\n\nHow is that steering from what started?\n\n&gt; I do not like being winked at by the person who is supposedly apologizing for insulting me.\n\n\nI think communication is lacking. I have not thrown anything on you, only on rex with reason. Maybe ask him next time to be rational instead of some pretend gift to us?",

When I first watched the video, I immediately thought. *Why hasn't this man received more attention?* He really is brilliant. I would love to see him on Piers Morgan.  I feel like he could deliver quite an embarrassment.  He is pretty impressive.  Cool that the 3D gun movement has such a widely read and well-spoken representative.  I rarely watch 30 minutes philosophy videos, but this one got me.   [deleted] Much of it seems to be focused on the idea that revolutions are never guaranteed in advance. They take a sort of unfounded personal confidence in the mind of the revolutionary, in opposition to prevailing social opinion.\n\nI think there are too many juicy points he touches on to try and condense it any further. It's really worth the watch. I think the aim of most writers and philosophers is to be concise and profound. I wonder sometimes if it's possible with these abstract ideas.\n\n(heavily edited/pared down my old post) [deleted]  I can't wait to see what Defence Dis. produces in a years time. It wont be to long before we will laugh at the days of gun control.   Background info\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=mFE_6DqpBvU\n(I'm on mobile, sorry)    Preface: Cody Wilson is an excellent speaker, and his efforts shouldn't go unnoticed. I do, however, have an issue with the sole emphasis of 3D printing. Yes, this is awesome technology, but far from new in my world of manufacturing, and certainly not without its flaws. If the state actually wises up to this one, they'll likely embrace the idea of 3D printed guns at home. Embrace, not fight.\n\nThink about it. An army of plastic wielding citizens, compared to a heavily armed state. We get so wrapped up in our ability to make our own plastic guns, the state shifts focus on abolishing all other gun types, claiming of course they are no longer necessary. The end result, single shot printed at home weapons against a superiorly armed state.\n\nSo, my call to Defense Dist is as follows: why limit to 3D printing, why not open up plans on manufacturing guns using 3D alongside traditional lathe, mill, and honing operations? This way, you get the benefits from ease and cost of manufacture, alongside the value of superior functioning parts (such as a non 3D printed barrel). You'd be able to make a fully functioning multi-use gun for less than half the cost today. And you wouldn't need the blessing from the all mighty state. 1. The traditional lathe, mill, and honing operations are (I presume) already well developed enough that Wilson wouldn't be adding much by incorporating that into his work.\n\n2. Cody's purpose seems to be not so much the creation of *a* plastic weapon, but the broader goal of creating the data file that enables decentralized knowledge of how to create a plastic weapon. I don't see any analogous purpose in metalworking the remaining parts of the gun. It's much harder to transfer the knowledge of how to create a high quality barrel than it is to transfer a CAD file automatically used by a 3D printer to create a lower receiver.\n\n3. The cost and lack of self-replicability of metalworking tools makes them inferior compared to plastic 3D printers as a means to achieving a decentralized manufacturing industry. &gt; The traditional lathe, mill, and honing operations are (I presume) already well developed enough that Wilson wouldn't be adding much by incorporating that into his work.\n\nBy incorporating traditional manufacturing methods with 3D printing, one could actually make an gun worth using. As far as this field being already well developed, not to my knowledge and certainly not with simultaneously combining 3D into the design of \"traditional\" parts. Search Google, you find some sights with general plans on how to make a gun, but they are not useful. There are no prints, CAD models, or best manufacturing practices.\n\n&gt; It's much harder to transfer the knowledge of how to create a high quality barrel than it is to transfer a CAD file automatically used by a 3D printer to create a lower receiver.\n\nCreating an even fair quality barrel machined in a lathe is effectively no different than a 3D printer. Both work with CAD files (of which can be sent automatically to the machine as you mention) and both require some print to identify manufacturing tolerances, if you want a part that functions properly.\n\n&gt; The cost and lack of self-replicability of metalworking tools makes them inferior compared to plastic 3D printers as a means to achieving a decentralized manufacturing industry.\n\nSearch on Craigslist for used machines, both manual and CNC. You'll be cheaper than any quality 3D printer worth using. As far as a \"means to achieving a decentralized manufacturing industry\", how does 3D printing solve this problem? You still have to purchase a 3D printer, of which can and likely will be highly regulated. Purchasing that, or a CNC mill/lathe, is no different on the quest for decentralizing. \n\nI've been in the manufacturing business, using a wide variety of machines including \"3D Printers\" (stereolithography to be exact) for over 18 years. Clearly, I'm all for decentralizing (I'm here in the subreddit, right?), but 3D printers are not going to get us there anytime soon. And, focusing solely on 3D printers as the magic solution, we will only set ourselves back. Some 3D printers are being designed to be self-replicable. In order to obtain one, you just need access to another 3D printer, rather than needing access to a centralized manufacturing company that makes lathes/mills. As far as I'm aware, one cannot replicate a mill simply by making parts with the mill.\n\n&gt;Purchasing that, or a CNC mill/lathe, is no different on the quest for decentralizing. \n\nAssuming the efforts to create self-replicable 3D printers are successful, the state could much more easily shut down metalworking tools used for making guns than they could shut down plastic 3D printers used for making guns. The state only has to threaten a few factory owners who are in charge of making metalworking tools, while they would have to threaten every single individual with a self-replicable printer to prevent their proliferation. Granted, the current number of available metalworking tools is probably far greater than the number of plastic 3D printers available, but the dynamics/second-order effects of the situation are in 3D printers' favor.\n\nI'm all for diversifying efforts, but I don't think what you're talking about deserves the level of attention that self-replicable printing deserves. I also don't think that Cody (who doesn't have an engineering/manufacturing background) is the best person to develop decentralized metalworking tech. Maybe you are?\n\n&gt;I've been in the manufacturing business, using a wide variety of machines including \"3D Printers\" (stereolithography to be exact) for over 18 years. Clearly, I'm all for decentralizing (I'm here in the subreddit, right?), but 3D printers are not going to get us there anytime soon.\n\nNo offense intended, but it seems like the people most closely associated with an industry are the people least likely to successfully recognize a sea change in their industry. &gt;No offense intended, but it seems like the people most closely associated with an industry are the people least likely to successfully recognize a sea change in their industry.\n\nSo, I've used both 3D printers &amp; CNC machines for over 18 years, and that's a negative? Man, you can't win sometimes.\n\nYou seem to be fighting the 3D printer is the end all solution, and I'll I'm trying to do is say bridge what technologies work best today. With my manufacturing background (using both 3D and CNC, yes I'm repeating myself for clarity), that bridge for the decentralized production of a gun is using both 3D and CNC. Not one or the other, but both.\n\nP.S. I'm guessing you and/or others here have read Daemon &amp; Freedom by Daniel Suarez? Even he, as a non-machinist, fused multiple manufacturing technologies in an effort for decentralization in his story line. I'm curious what ideas you have for decentralization of CNC. I'm skeptical that such a change is as possible/as revolutionary as the similar move to decentralized plastic printing, but maybe you have thought of something I haven't. You'd make me quite happy to hear of such a possibility of decentralized metalworking, so my bias is in your favor. I just haven't seen evidence that it's possible. Abolish IP would be number 1. Get that out of the way, or simply refuse to acknowledge it's existence, and information will flow. This includes drawings, CAD files, CAM files, NCF files, basically everything needed to manufacture in both 3D and CNC environments. \n\nEven if you had a 3D printer, likely you can't print every type of part (even these printers have specialties). So, a darknet of sorts, to group a variety of manufacturing capabilities together so as to get a wide range of parts manufactured. So one has a 3D printer, another has a lathe, another a mill, and together we can make real parts without government intrusion.\n\nMoney that needs to be exchanged can be done by Bitcoin, so that problem has been solved in terms of decentralization.\n\n3D and CNC are much of the same to me, i.e. the end result is to make an effective part and both are used to do that. Granted, the latest movements in 3D technologies are exciting, but you should visit IMTS and see the latest CNC developments as well. They're both amazing technologies to watch grow, and I'm looking foward to seeing them all decentralized. Very cool information, thanks.\n\nWhat sort of innovations do you see being necessary to get this off the ground, specifically as a pro-liberty/pro-agorist movement? It sounds like the files already exist; I presume those could be transferred at will over a darknet. Are you proposing that the actual manufacturing file sharing network needs to be created? Seems like that could be implemented tomorrow via torrenting. (I doubt there is an RIAA/MPAA equivalent for CNC files that would attempt to stop such a thing from happening.)\n\nI guess I just don't see what sort of unique contributions need to be added to the development of CNC manufacturing. Do the specific files need to be created for the creation of metal firearm parts? If so, I agree I would love to see such a development in action; I just think Cody Wilson isn't the best person for the job right now, but I appreciate the sentiment. Again, it sounds like you might even be a good candidate for starting that up. :)\n\nIMTS sounds interesting, and I'm actually within range of visiting. How much does attendance cost? &gt; What sort of innovations do you see being necessary to get this off the ground, specifically as a pro-liberty/pro-agorist movement? It sounds like the files already exist; I presume those could be transferred at will over a darknet. Are you proposing that the actual manufacturing file sharing network needs to be created? Seems like that could be implemented tomorrow via torrenting.\n\nYes, torrenting is the best distribution method I know of for sharing manufacturing files. Companies tend to hold many of these machine specific files (called post processors) sacred, as the market charges a fortune for this stuff, and we don't want to give away what cost us an arm and a leg. Crazy really, if companies would just band together and share this information, we'd all save in the long run. This is coming from the angle of business owner, so I'm not trying to \"get a free ride\" with this comment. Sharing is often a good thing, even in capitalism.\n\nPutting post processor talk aside, the work flow for manufacturing distribution would go something like this:\n\n1st, you'd need a print (drawing) complete with tolerances, surface finishes, etc. This got me immediately on the Defense Dist database. Going straight to CNC or 3D Print without part tolerances is simply absurd, unless the part was a small figurine intended as a gift for your wife/girlfriend. All machines are imperfect, so when making something like a gun, the part better measure within tolerance if you want to keep your fingers in tact. Although not a deal breaker, it would be nice to have the original CAD file on hand as well. This way, using your own software, you could tweak the part as you saw fit. In terms of manufacturing and distribution, this actually isn't necessary but should be included.\n\n2nd, you'd need the NCF file for CNCs (along with a tool list; basically what cutting tools are used in the NCF) or the STL file for printers. The NCF and STL files are the code that communicates to the machine how the part is made (where to move, how fast to cut and turn for CNC, etc). They are machine specific (yes, even the 3D Printer STL files can be a pain in the ass this way), so if there was a tricky part this would be it. As with the CAD example above, it would be nice to have the CAM file used to generate the NCF file, but again not necessary to get the job done. Remember the post processor talk above? You need that to go from CAM to NCF, arguably the biggest pain in the ass in the entire process. Would be easy though, if companies opened this information up.\n\nSo, that's a drawing with tolerances and a NCF and/or STL file. And, of course, you'd have to have the machine with tools and/or resin, but that part was obvious.\n\n&gt; I just think Cody Wilson isn't the best person for the job right now, but I appreciate the sentiment. Again, it sounds like you might even be a good candidate for starting that up. :)\n\nCody is a well spoken law student, with his team consisting of a philosophy student, computer science graduate, android developer, a \"hard knocks\" graduate, a medical student, an english student, and an electrical engineering student. For now, this project is centered around philosophy more than manufacturing, as evidence by it's members and the way they are moving things forward. I'm sure they're all good people and yes they're just 6 months old (not the people, the organization), but I'm hoping they progress more toward the manufacturing side of the mission as time goes on. I don't need philosophy, or another book, as I'm already sold on Anarcho-Capitalism. We'll see where they go, I'm certainly paying attention.

    "snippet" : "If anarcho-capitalists believe in a truely free-market economy and personal liberty, does that not exclude the right for people to become employees of another persons business, and for that business to establish heiarachle structures within itself? How does this ideology prevent these entities from dominating certain markets?\n\nFor example, if all courts and enforcement are private, what prevents a individuals collective entity from purchasing all the courts, then allowing all decisions to benefit their own collective entities assets (such as food, water, other essential elements for survival) when people challenge them?\n\nWould this not be the same or worse than an authoritarian state?\n\nIs the only solution violence?  If courts are profitable others will enter the market. And something as important and relatively easy to provide *(you should be an expert in the field, but as an academic service there's little physical limitations like scarcity of mines or other resources)* as law, we should expect plenty of competition. \n\nAnd if they violate their own laws by making biased decisions they are nothing but criminals and other independent courts should hold them accountable. Besides, who would purchase the services of a court that's so incompetent...\n\n&gt;Is the only solution violence?\n\nAll law is violence, so the answer would pretty much be yes. Basically, statism and anything similar will be illegal. Like any other crime it should be dealt with by force.  Who defines the legality of these things? I, and many ancaps, favor a common law system where the courts, while acting independently, act primarily by the precedent of other courts. \n\nI'm also assuming a court system that's primarily libertarian, since it wouldn't really be ancap otherwise.  Who enforces the laws, and who would say who is to enforce what (would a private enforcement agency possibly be aligned with only one court agency)?\n\nAll of this sounds rather Utopian to me. Either it all works perfectly or none of it works.  A lot of the power or anarcho-capitalism is in the power of \"no.\" By refusing to participate in this state-synonym, I take away its power as does everyone else. Even 5% of people refusing to participate can have a tremendous impact.\n\nIf the people of anarcholand become lazy and fearful and hand over their \"no\" power to this state, then it will exist just as it does today.\n\nIt requires a change of attitude among the average person to take responsibility for the world around them. This is why most ancaps are against violent revolution because we need the change of attitude. We don't need to take the reins. Except there are things that ultimately are beyond the capabilities of a single person/family unit.\n\nUnless you plan to go back to homesteading and abandon all modern niceties you will have to rely on others for a lot of things that you are simply not capable of producing yourself. I doubt every family is going to have a steel mill, microchip fabrication facilities, rubber plantations, mines, and other needed facilities for producing the raw and completed goods that modern society subsists on. Ultimately you will rely on someone for something, and probably that something is going to be a thing you use everyday now (for example, the internet, unless you expect every Jane and Joe to be able to go out, lay fiber, build routing facilities, and then negotiate how to connect to other networks, you are going to be with out it).

You can still interact with them. You aren't bound to the terms of MegaDRO unless you choose to as part of your contract. Hopefully you can see what the constant choice of \"modern niceties\" at the expense of liberty begets.\n\nNot entirely sure about the down votes, but your response seems very nearly off-topic. I hope it's not disagreements.  &gt;...what prevents [X] from doing [Y] in an ancap society?\n\nWhat prevents them from doing it now? I mean, seriously, just think through the logically probable scenarios and you'd be able to answer this question for yourself quite easily. \n\nRight now, in our current statist paradigm, the mechanisms are in place that allow the possibility that a single individual could gain god-emperor status and rule over the entire planet with an iron fist. So what? What's the likelihood that that would ever happen? So close to zero it might as well be zero. But just because there is a non-zero probability that it could happen, should we spend even a nanosecond contemplating it? Methinks it would be a waste of time.\n\nI really don't understand people's obsession with these kinds of lifeboat scenarios. Let's talk about scenarios that we are likely to face in a free society rather than pick nits over the unlikeliest of possibilities. \n Well in a state you have *single source* codified laws and enforcement (the state) that have been agreed upon and accepted by a society as the rules in which to live by. Disagreements are worked out within this single system always (even through third party arbitration, the result is a contract, and contract enforcement is handled by the state through the courts). Yes, someone could work the system and game it and probably end up with more power than they should, but there is a framework in place that makes it much harder to do, because everyone agrees that the framework is how they should live (and if people try to act outside the framework they are punished).\n\nAnarcho-capitalism seems centered around having NO framework whatsoever. Anyone can implement their own version of a social framework at any time and no one has to agree to follow it. Arbitration seems far more likely to come at the end of a gun (aka force) than voluntarily, because there is no one status quo in terms of enforcing laws fairly and equally.\n\nThis is to not disregard that there are biases in a state system, at all levels, but in a democratic system ultimately power does rest with the people to shape their state. To throw it all out just because sometimes something bad could/does happen seems to negate the overall necessity for such a central power to be the ultimate arbiter. Essentially, do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. &gt;Anarcho-capitalism seems centered around having NO framework whatsoever.\n\nWhat is your source for this claim?\n\n&gt;Anyone can implement their own version of a social framework at any time and no one has to agree to follow it.\n\nThis may be true but I don't see why it is relevant. \n\n&gt;Arbitration seems far more likely to come at the end of a gun (aka force) than voluntarily, because *there is no one status quo in terms of enforcing laws fairly and equally*.\n\nAgain, what is your source for this claim?\n\n&gt;To throw it all out just because sometimes something bad could/does happen seems to negate *the overall necessity for such a central power to be the ultimate arbiter*. \n\nOnce again, what is your source for this claim? \n\n From my interpretation of what I have read on Wikipedia and other sources. If you care to counter my claims, please do so.\n\nWhat framework for a social-legal structure does anarcho-capitalism have? How can you possibly ask this question seriously? The entire point of anarcho-capitalism is that there is no framework for a \"social-legal\" structure. Whatever \"framework\" there is exists in constant flux, dependent on the markets for arbitration and legal security.\n\nThe people who discuss anarcho-capitalism in terms of natural rights and deontology are wrong. It is a mistake for anarcho-capitalists to subscribe to that view entirely for the sake of defending their arguments.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is a result of capital and (hence) technological accumulation in a given society. At some point in the process of accumulation, it becomes too easy for individuals and private firms to work around the central state ([crypto-anarchy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism)). The central state becomes increasingly incapable of adapting to new technological and market conditions, due to its poor internal mechanisms for adapting to change and the lack of incentives for it to do so. Gradually or abruptly, the central state loses its advantage and collapses into obscurity. The far leaner and responsive market system fills in the void left by the state (in terms of services provided like law, arbitration, infrastructure, etc.). There is no framework or social-contract beyond \"be a good dude, pass the joint to the left, look both ways before crossing the street, the golden rule, etc.\" - customs, manners, and organic norms. Instead, *market mechanisms* of supply and demand replace the old system of fiat law, security, and arbitration (\"fiat\" implying central, top-down, planned).\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is entirely anti-utopian, in fact it borders on dystopian. Its existence or atmosphere would not be dystopian, but the mechanisms of such a society run counter to the traditional concept of \"utopia\". Utopias are planned, perfect, and eternal. Anarcho-capitalism is the epitome of spontaneity, flux, and constant tinkering.\n\nFor a better understanding of anarcho-capitalism, read some David Friedman, Konkin, or stuff by crypto-anarchists. Ok, I understand that. Thats why I was asking the person above my reply that you replied to what they thought it meant, because I stated pretty much what you stated and they seemed to be questioning it. From my interpretation of what I have read on Wikipedia and other sources. If you care to counter my claims, please do so.\n\nWhat framework for a social-legal structure does anarcho-capitalism have?

    "snippet" : "Hey everyone,\n\nI started a blog about a week ago about ethics, politics and economics through a voluntaryist lens.  I would like to blog about things that are relevant to current events with a pretty easy-to-understand approach.  Does anyone have a few ideas that I could use to start out writing about?  \n\nI want to write a blog about voting, being a female an-cap, drones, etc.  Any other ideas of easy topics to bring in more people?\n\nThanks :)  What interests and fascinates you?  What are you passionate about?  I'm not familiar enough with your writing to give specific content suggestions.\n\nUsually I write articles or blog-style posts whenever I am thinking about a subject or actively engaged in a subject.  I tend to not \"force\" it - but regularly an idea will pop into my head, I'll figure out all the angles, and then be motivated enough to actually write it.\n\nMy style is likely different from yours though; I approach things more like a combination of art and programming; the article is always a work-in-progress, which might be upgraded, modified, enhanced, replaced, etc. I guess I should do a little research on Yahoo News or something and see what current events are trending.  Typically just listening to NPR gets me going in a direction.  :)  Thanks for the thoughts. No problem.\n\nCould you post a link to your blog/website?  Seeing some of your current writing might be useful for persons wishing to give you recommendations. Sure: I only have one post so far.  I plan to start updating more often.  I need to just write instead of putting so much thought into *what* to write about.  \n\nhttp://inlahmanstermstheblog.blogspot.com/  If you have a pretty Glam photo on your blog, write a post about how, frequently, it can be difficult to meet guys who aren't in the matrix. My sister would read that. So would a lot of ancap forever alones. \"Is statism a sexual turn off?\" - that should get you some page views.\n\nNext write about how deep you feel like diving into these topics as a lady. Do you primarily like the community itself and the non violent ethos, or is your goal to read everything rothbard and spooner and Friedman?\n\nA treatise on feminism and voluntarism, are they compatible? This would ideally be light and would answer more/less in the affirmative. Shiinee might like this.\n\nOnce you get going this way, and establish where you are coming from, you can write about what strikes you, or respond to what your fans tell you that they want to read about. Nice ideas.  I'm a pretty outspoken and unapologetic anarchist which in itself tends to be a turnoff to most guys.  I'll definitely keep this topic in mind. :)   The Gilded Age. The left misrepresents it every chance they get because its one of their most powerful cards in an emotional diatribe  As a female ancap you would have a unique perspective on how and why you became an ancap and what is holding other women back. Definitely, and I want to use that prospective frequently.  Do you have any suggestions for topics that women are interested in?   I have a blog but I post about a lot of things from Anarcho-capitalism to Albania to Youth Rights etc. Which is probably why it isn't popular lol link? lets make it popular?     * I like gun in the room arguments that average people can understand\n* I like history comparisons, like Roman shit to current affairs\n* Explaining Fiat currency in very simple terms, if you can, is very helpful, people can sort of grasp the idea that they've screwed over their own children, but they need it more concrete\n* I like comparisons between what government sanctions in say gambling, like state run lotto, which gives less than half the money to the winner, to when mob runs numbers and gives out ninety percent\n* There are a lot of personal liberty issues, smoking weed, prostitution, that people instinctively realize society over reacts too, but they can't quite put their finger on the fact that the state actually profits from the illegality of it, it's a profit motive question, not a moral one\n* I'd like to see more people, esp, the younger generation, realize we incarcerate so many people in American, again, it's a profit motive question\n* War, drones, etc. these are good topics, personally, if you're a student of history, relating stories from past, stuff people can instinctively say \"that's bad\" to current affairs, is a powerful tool, I'd like to see more stories out there where the country is not identified in the story, until you've got the reader to mentally say \"that's evil\" and then tell them, yeah, and your tax dollars are paying for that, today.\n \n\nAnyway, this is fun, hope this helps, I'll follow your writing and am happy to make suggestions     Welp, I'm subscribed and will comment. Warning, I usually lose interest within a couple weeks. Good luck!  ",

In 100% agreement. I have a few friends on welfare and they have asked me if I am mad at them before because of it, I always tell them: absolutely not, you are working with what you got.

What if it would be more efficient for the gentleman on benifits to buy a butter knife and rob people himself? These people cannot be shielded entirely from the blame. The entitlement society needs to be stigmatized and shamed. People, in general, do not need to be stigmatized and shamed. People need empathy and need to understand things better. The idea that making a person feel bad is going to make them pull themselves up by the boot straps when they have no marketable skills and probably already feel pretty wretched is one that rarely pans out.

It sucks they don't know they are contributing to their own demise with their belief systems. There are things I wish they would do otherwise, but I honestly cannot blame people for being completely fucked over every step of the way and doing what they can to get by. Ditto people who steal. I do not think it is a nice thing, it makes me sad that this is where things are, it sucks there are not better options for these people...but there are not. Law of least effort and whatnot: \n\n\"Our instinct is to get the most out of life with the least expenditure of labor.\" -Chodorov and every other Austrian economist. I disagree. Stigma and shame were central to the Protestant work ethic which gave rise to American prosperity. Non-market forces are important incentives. People used to do whatever they could to avoid going on the \"dole\" which made more charitable resources available to those who really need it. Ethics and morality are just as important as eliminating the state. I do not have any problem with ethics and morality; I am not a nihilist. I do not think that shame is a healthy way to influence people. Shame creates a terrible cascade in your nervous system that actives neural circuitry and hormone production that pretty much puts you on edge all of the time, puts you in fight-or-flight mode and makes you feel alienated from your fellow man. Inflicting this on people does not seem moral to me and certainly does not seem the way to produce a peaceful, cohesive society. \n\n**edit:** In a clinical environment, getting people over their shame and guilt is directly used to rehabilitate people from undesirable behaviors. This is true of drug recovery, pedophilia, and even criminal recovery. There is little reason to believe on a neurobiological basis or as far as research shows that shame is an affective way to avert bad behavior, especially in a society that is quite large. Sometimes this works in tribal societies because everyone knows everyone; that does not mean it should at all be a model.  \n\nAlso, this is being recognized all over the place. Prison programs in many states and many countries--[the one in Norway being my favorite](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/24/world/europe/norway-prison-bastoy-nicest/index.html)--are having great success with this model.

People, in general, do need to be stigmatized and shamed if they are doing something undesirable; in fact, stigma and shame is one of the most important self-regulating aspects of a free market system. I believe people need to be treated well to learn how to treat others well. I think if they haven't learned to treat other people well, this largely has to do with shame and fear. I believe these things because of research I have done on the subject as well as personal experience. I am going to bring up a few examples of things that can be effective but I don't think are the best way to handle things, but I in no way mean stigmatizing things are on the same level: imprisonment, blackmail, murder, torture, isolation, etc. Again, I do not think these are the equivalent of ostracism, but the fact that they can be used to modify people's behavior in no way means that it is the best way to handle the situation. Many reactions that are blind to people's internal motivations create short-term compliance and even then, only when someone is looking. Stigmatize drinking, you'll see closet alcoholics; stigmatize homosexuality, you see more closet gays, etc., etc. I often regret bringing these things up in political discussions because there is more than sufficient evidence to support the idea that ostracism can be effective in curbing behavior, but anyhow...\n\n &gt;but the fact that they can be used to modify people's behavior in no way means that it is the best way to handle the situation\n\nI am not claiming that shaming and stigma is necessarily good because it modifies behavior.\n\n&gt;Stigmatize drinking, you'll see closet alcoholics; stigmatize homosexuality, you see more closet gays, etc., etc.\n\nAnd you will also see people who do not do those things (or not as much) because they are stigmatized and shamed. Just because some may do it in private does not mean it doesn't reduce the undesirable behavior. I do not see that. I have personally met people who grew up in families where alcoholism was not shamed or stigmatized but had absolutely not attraction to it. I myself am a person who grew up surrounded by a community who very strongly advocated welfare and admonished me for not taking advantage of it when I needed it and qualified for it, but I did not because it does not jive with my beliefs.  \n\nIf you are not claiming it is good because it modifies behavior, what is it good for?

The British benefit system actually hinders social mobility, ironic given that it's one of the oft touted reasons for it's existence.\n\nWhile working for a living would (perhaps) give this couple lower living standards for a while, they would be gaining skills and experience that in future, would allow them to command a higher price for their labour and progress socially and economically.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the benefit system, they are doomed to have the same quality of life that they currently have, for as long as English Socialism lasts. When British socialism finally collapses, these people will be cast out onto their streets - middle aged, with no qualifications or experience.\n\nDespite these people leeching off of my taxes I'm not angry - I pity them. &gt; leeching off of my taxes\n\nWhat makes 'em leeches? What makes 'em \"your\" taxes? The government steals money from you and then hands it out to people. They'd be idiots to not accept it. They're not taking anything from *you*. Would you knowingly accept stolen goods? Do you consider people that do to be moral? Would you knowingly drive on roads paid for with stolen goods? Bad argument. Not really much choice there as opposed to the other example. Would you knowingly drive on roads paid for with stolen goods? Would you knowingly accept stolen goods? Do you consider people that do to be moral? They consider it as reclaiming what was stolen from their parents, I don't think that is immoral.  That's a horribly written article. Still, stories like these come up every once in a while, and people always get outraged at the people who receive the benefits. I think that is absolutely backwards. I would of course also claim any benefits I could from the government. The rage is misdirected, because it is not people on welfare who take your money, it's the government, and the people who vote for that government.

Why not both?  Fucking assholes. I don't agree that it is the system.  People don't hold them responsible.  But they don't hold themselves responsible either.  They're lazy and they know, for a fact, that it is at the expense of others.  As much as it is a corrupt system, they are aggressing against others by ok'ing the theft of other peoples property for their own benefit.  And they refuse to even try.  My husband and I live in Canada, and make less than the $34,000 equivalent to 17, 000 pounds.  We work hard to earn our money, and we are friends with people on welfare.  As much as I think we live in a flawed system, there are people like that who feel completely justified to live off that system.  \n\nInterestingly enough there are programs here in Canada where the government will pay to relocate you to an area that is hurting for employees, but people still choose welfare instead and remain where they are.  It's not about getting work, or being responsible, it's about being too comfortable and lazy to change one's style of living.  \n\nI do understand that many people have no other choice than welfare, and that people/families do use welfare as a stepping stone to help work towards gaining their place in the work environment as economically contributing members.  \n\nThese people chose to talk to the newspaper, so if they are demonised? Fuck them I say.  \n\nThis subreddit is fine with bleeding the state dry, except that's not the case.  The state is never bled dry.  It is always fed by the taxpayers who themselves are bled dry.  \n\n-I apologize for my vehemence but this topic really gets me going.    I know every generation likes to say it, but today's youth are brats.  They just do what they are incentivized to do. If a private company offered you that kind of salary for doing nothing at all, would you be a brat if you refused to accept that position? I'd say you would be stupid if you did not take it without hesitation.\n\nIt is the government being stupid for offering those kinds of \"jobs\".  Anarcho-capitalists love making people work.  Ancaps for the most part have the most reactionary attitude towards work. &gt;Anarcho-capitalists love self-sufficiency.\n\nFTFY. It's almost as if everyone pulling their own weight leads to a more prosperous and less government's-cock-sucking society!  Middle class white male college kids pulling their weight.  That's funny.",

    "title" : "Using force to create herd immunity / quarantine Typhoid Mary",
    "snippet" : "First, disclaimer: On other subreddits I've been defending IP and necessarily the state. I also wrung the cloth dry with antagonistic prose in doing so. Please forgive me. But after clicking around a bit I found /r/Anarcho_Capitalism and its linked materials, and I got a big chin-rubbing \"hmmm...\" thing going on. So I hope you don't plonk me down as a troll right front and center. (Although I could be).\n\nDoes the NAP allow using force to quarantine the unwitting carrier of an infectious disease? This would not have to be someone who willfully spreads the disease, but someone like Mary Mallon who was _asymptomatic_ and honestly didn't believe that she was a threat to anyone.\n\nA related question is whether it's right to use force in an immunization program for diseases where herd immunity is the only realistic defense against disaster, e.g.: viruses that can mutate rapidly once it has a foothold in a community, defeating vaccines that individuals take voluntarily. That is: if not enough individuals take the vaccine against the current strain, then the vaccine is useless because there'll be enough \"food\" to fuel viral evolution around it.  &gt;Does the NAP allow using force to quarantine...\n\nWell no... but it certainly allows people to deny access to property and has no prohibitions against spreading knowledge about a particular plague-ridden danger.  I certainly would not allow someone with a disease onto my property, and would prefer businesses that did the same.  Since there would be no or minimal \"public\" spaces, this would effectively result in quarantine.\n\n&gt;A related question is whether it's right to use force in an immunization program\n\nThis is also a definite no.  However, again, the power to deny service would have a similar effect.  I would prefer that my daughter only attend private schools that require verification of immunization for particular dangerous strains.  I would also prefer to work in an environment that took similar precautions if it seemed important.\n\nIn addition...  because I am generally \"pro-immunization\" I would support information campaigns and similar attempts to spread knowledge and shape the culture to one that encourages immunization for potentially dangerous diseases.  I would also donate for free immunization groups if cost was a prohibitive factor.\n &gt; Since there would be no or minimal \"public\" spaces, this would effectively result in quarantine.\n\n I noticed on another post a discussion of the hypothetical pickpocket being denied access to private property once his activity was detected, and it made me wonder something else:\n\n _Somebody_ will have to inherit this person, because presumably all neighboring private landlords will deny them access. Where does this person go?\n\n In the case of an infectious disease, especially one transmitted through the air, would you not soon have a containment problem? Someone winds up with all the hot potatoes, is overwhelmed, and the containment fails. Bob Murphy was talking about the idea of \"prisons\" as a result of this sort of thing. If everyone else won't let you onto their property, they'll take you on and agree to attempt to rehabilitate you and your reputation as a result if you agree to do certain things, stay on your property, etc. Sort of a voluntary prison. Just some food for thought -- I don't necessarily agree with the idea. It is an interesting idea. Presumably the prisoner would pay for his incarceration? &gt; Since there would be no or minimal \"public\" spaces, this would effectively result in quarantine.\n\n I noticed on another post a discussion of the hypothetical pickpocket being denied access to private property once his activity was detected, and it made me wonder something else:\n\n _Somebody_ will have to inherit this person, because presumably all neighboring private landlords will deny them access.

I'm a Georgist so a proper ancap will need to help you with that one.  \n\n&gt;In the case of an infectious disease, especially one transmitted through the air, would you not soon have a containment problem?\n\nNot sure how this problem would differ significantly under ancap than any other system.  Containment will always be problematic, but will depend on people denying access of infected to new zones. &gt; Since there would be no or minimal \"public\" spaces, this would effectively result in quarantine.\n\n I noticed on another post a discussion of the hypothetical pickpocket being denied access to private property once his activity was detected, and it made me wonder something else:\n\n _Somebody_ will have to inherit this person, because presumably all neighboring private landlords will deny them access.

The chances that *no one* will let them cross their land is low, but *most* people will not.\n\n&gt;In the case of an infectious disease, especially one transmitted through the air, would you not soon have a containment problem?

The chances that no one will let them cross their land is low, but most people will not.\n\n Here's one of things I'm trying to solve:\n\n If you detect a Typhoid Mary or pickpocket, then--as I understand it--an AnCap society would deal with the problem by evicting them from their property and alerting everyone that this person is dangerous, resulting in them denying that person access to their property as well.\n\n However, if they tell everyone about the threat _before_ they evict them, then they won't be able to evict them because their neighbors will deny them at the border. You're right that most people will not allow an infectious carrier passage through their land if it puts them at risk of contagion, or of being stuck with them if they can't get access to cross the next property.\n\n Yet if they delay sending the notification in order to get rid of their problem, then their neighbors will judge them as untrustworthy because they effectively withheld important information in order to shove the problem onto somebody else.\n\n Wouldn't this mean that the landlord who first discovers a Typhoid Mary or a criminal would either be stuck with them, or lose everyone's trust? No.\n\n&gt;If you detect a Typhoid Mary or pickpocket, then--as I understand it--an AnCap society would deal with the problem by evicting them from their property and alerting everyone that this person is dangerous, resulting in them denying that person access to their property as well.... etc.\n\nThis presumes no one is a doctor or owns a hospital, or something like the CDC.  All of those things have private utility and will likely continue to exist in some form.  So the person who is ill will probably be sent to a hospital of some kind, either at their expense or paid by their insurance. &gt; So the person who is ill will probably be sent to a hospital of some kind, either at their expense or paid by their insurance.\n\n Right, but wouldn't you need to use force to do that? Mary Mallon wasn't willing to go into quarantine voluntarily. From Wikipedia:\n\n \"She was forcibly isolated twice by public health authorities and died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation.\"\n\n Furthermore, Mary was _asymptomatic_, she wasn't ill, but she was an infectious carrier. Somebody who contracts the disease from a carrier has done nothing wrong, especially if it occurs before someone has been identified as a carrier.\n\n The CDC, as I understand it, can use force provided by the state to enter someone's property and quarantine anyone who's infected or suspected of being infected. &gt;Right, but wouldn't you need to use force to do that?\n\nEviction is defense of property and is not aggression within the NAP.  What the person who is evicted does from there is not the property owners problem.\n\nIf the person who is not allowed on any property but their own and those of contracted health care providers wants to leave the health care providers property *and they have somewhere to go* then no one will stop them.  If they do not have anywhere to go, and are not allowed to be anywhere but the hospital, I do not see that they have much choice.  This is simply a consequence of private property and freedom of association.  No one is required to provide you access to their property or person. Would the hospital be required to accept infectious patients who have no insurance/insufficient-insurance or cannot pay for their quarantine? No, but to be allowed on anyone else's property you would probably have to carry insurance including catastrophic medical care and criminal investigation. Would the hospital be required to accept infectious patients who have no insurance/insufficient-insurance or cannot pay for their quarantine? &gt;Would the hospital be required to accept infectious patients...?\n\nRequired by whom? &gt; Since there would be no or minimal \"public\" spaces, this would effectively result in quarantine.\n\n I noticed on another post a discussion of the hypothetical pickpocket being denied access to private property once his activity was detected, and it made me wonder something else:\n\n _Somebody_ will have to inherit this person, because presumably all neighboring private landlords will deny them access.

I would also donate for free immunization groups if cost was a prohibitive factor.\n How do you know a person has a disease that needs to be put into quarantine? If they're asymptomatic it's very hard: either via epidemiology or because you've screened them for a known pathogen.\n\n_Edit:_ I don't presently know how an AnCap society would handle an epidemiological investigation, though. It's like being a germ detective: you need to gather evidence that mainly comes from tissue and body fluid samples. An investigation that hopes to yield useful results can require taking samples from individuals who won't consent, or entering/taking property--such as human and animal corpses. I suppose if I were running the disease center, I might hand out armbands to those who have been screened or gotten vaccines.  Anyone who doesn't have the arm band.... might find other people unwilling to interact with them.\n\n Alright, but those armbands would need a system for easily conveying recency and scope. \n\nAlso, are we looking at a society that now needs \"flair\" for basic human interaction? Not necessarily; remember you're discussing a rare emergency situation.\n\n---\n\nCompare that to government, whereby if you don't have government's license (their version of the armband), you will find your activities labeled as \"illegal\" and your business FORCEFULLY shut down.  I dropped making appeals to *\"aggression\"* a while ago, especially after realizing the subjectivity and poor definition.\n\nIf it could be shown that a person was causing quantifiable harm to others, it could be argued that any force used to stop or prevent further harm is an act of self-defense.  Overall, yes, I would support the use of force in scenario #1.\n\nScenario #2 is more complex:  The person is also not performing an action, so it would seem that the closest context in law might be *\"neglect,\"* however for neglect to be enforced against, usually that neglect must cause some harm to other persons or property.  Perhaps once they do cause harm, perhaps they could be held liable, which might act as an incentive.  I could not support force in scenario #2.\n\nOne last note, tyrants and fraudsters are notorious for taking advantage of distorted incentives and values that appear in apparent emergencies *(see: war on... terror, drug, nazis, jews, slavery, etc)*.  As such, I'd encourage STRONG caution against bending one's values.\n\n---------------\n\n&gt; *\"On other subreddits I've been defending IP and necessarily the state.\"*\n\nApologies on the slightly O.T. comment.

    "title" : "Liability in the case of the Brazil nightclub fire",
    "snippet" : "I would like to hear /r/Anarcho_Capitalism 's opinion about this.\n\nAs I assume many of you know, yesterday there was a fire at a nightclub in a southern Brazil. The last information I heard is that 232 young people died; apparently, the causes involve a pyrotechnics show within an enclosed area, unsafe building and signing practices, and overzealous bouncers who locked the place down, thinking it was \"just\" a fight happening inside.\n\nSo, to put it simply: the people operating the nightclub caused the deaths of over two hundred youngsters.\n\nMost people's reactions have involved calling for more enforcement of regulations. I'm trying to avoid such knee-jerk statism, and I thought in an ancap society the nightclub would be insured for the liability he would face with regards to the survivors and the victims' families.\n\nSo, here's my question: let's assume, for the sake of argument, such a tragedy happened in Ancapistan. The insurer would pay all those liability claims, and turn to those responsible for the damage to recoup their losses, at least partially. How on Earth would the nightclub owners ever begin repaying their debt? On a smaller scale - say, someone murders one person - I can imagine they will eventually make enough money during their lifetime to make up for the compensation they owed, but what happens when someone owes such a large sum?\n\nAccording to one view present here which I think makes sense, most people would demand from others that they are insured against liability in order to conduct any business transactions with them; the nightclub owners' insurance premiums would become enormous, but if they wanted to interact with the world they'd have to pay them; how will they be able to afford this? What if they decide it's just better to suicide? The insurance company will have to suffer the losses?\n\ntl;dr How can the owners of a nightclub where there's a fire which kills hundreds of people ever repay the compensations they owe? (I'm sorry for the wall of text.)\n\n**EDIT** - I'd like to thank everyone who posted their opinion. You are right: in the end, the demand from club-goers that the places they patronise are insured would provide a much higher safety standard than erratic, arbitrary state regulations. The tragedy would likely not have occurred or had the huge extension it ended up having.      If you murder someone you should be executed, that one isn't a problem.\n\nAs for an unreasonable debt, I suppose a debtor prison could work. Work 'em until they pay what they owe, if it takes their whole life so be it. Or possibly expel them from society, either physically or implicitly through outlawry.  But who has the authority to preform the execution?  Who has the authority to throw someone into a prison?  If someone did, would that not be considered slavery? But who has the authority to preform the execution?  Who has the authority to throw someone into a prison?  If someone did, would that not be considered slavery?",

    "title" : "The relationship between Anarchism and Atheism",
    "snippet" : "I'm really just curious about people's \"journeys\" in both politics and religion, and how they tend to correlate. I was raised Christian and Republican, became atheist first, and then anarcho-capitalist second. I'm biased (and live in the Bible belt) so I tend to think this is the same direction other people go. I am wondering if I am really far off in my assumptions. I have known a few Christian Anarcho-capitalists, but I am curious if that is a small minority, vast minority, or majority. I really have no idea.\n\nI know in my own personal \"revelations\" I saw the evidence of the inconsistency of religion, the use of it by people to control others, and the way I defended it using \"logic\" that I knew, deep down, I didn't even believe in. Shortly after, I asked myself \"what else in my life do I believe in just because I was brought up that way?\" and came to the conclusion that absolute liberty is the only fully moral political position. \n\nHow about you?\n\n   Very similar story here. The similarities between statism and religious beliefs are quite profound, once you look. Historically, that has been the case. Right now, at least in the West, I think there is no comparison. With very few exceptions, in the West religion is non-violent and completely voluntary. The biggest exception is religious agendas being pushed through the political system (where the \"political system\" is inherently violent), but pretty much every individual and organization does that. Voluntary in the same sense that statism is voluntary. There's still the issue of childhood indoctrination, willful ignorance, and a sense of a \"social contract\" to keep people inside the machine. Statism isn't voluntary in any sense, though. A very common statist idea is that by being born into the country, you voluntarily agree to the social contract, and thus taxes are no longer theft. And I think that's ridiculous. Even looking at it historically, the whole notion of social contract was developed to attempt to justify the obvious contradiction between rules that everyone agrees with (like don't steal) and the state, which breaks those rules. It was an attempt to dispel the cognitive dissonance that Enlightenment philosophers faced. And I'm trying to be as inoffensive as possible, since I used to be there, but can't you see a parallel between the crazy notion the social contract with the crazy notion of the existence of an all-powerful all-knowing spiritual figure that will punish you for all eternity if you don't follow his rules? I'm speaking for the judeo-christian God, as that's what I'm most familiar with, but there's a lot of political nonsense involved with religion because of its ties to the state, as well as many NAP-violating commands.   Statism is a religion and anarchism is a faith. You have people who are religious fanatics but use religion for their own gain, and you have Christians who have faith, and don't support mega-churches, and are more focused on their community groups and how to help each other in times of need.\n\nIf you look in the Bible, the first churches were small and very active in their community, more anarchic than what we have now. For me, being a Christian, I have to ask God what to do with my life. I'm not sure what my faith in Jesus has to do with Earthly Statism and tax dollars going to Bahrain to pay for Tear Gas.    Similar journey for myself. I started questioning the beliefs I was raised on around 13, by 15 I was an atheist. \n\nI did what most new atheists do, I looked for debates and tried to show people the inconsistencies in religion. After a few years of constant debate I realized I was really just trying to prove atheism to myself in a way. Really it isn't something I spend much time thinking about anymore and I hardly talk about it unless someone directly asks me about it. I'm quite sure a militant atheist could put me in a corner and I would just say that I'm agnostic. Before I unsubscribed to /r/atheism I understood what it was, a place where new atheists circlejerked trying to prove atheism to themselves. I think that is a stage that most atheists 'outgrow'. \n\nAround 16 I really started to get into politics. My mother was a huge influence. She is a brilliant women and I would give her credit for my being an an-cap more than any other one individual. I would spend hours talking with her about politics and we would listen to conservative talk radio. I started seeing the inconsistencies of both parties. The Democrats and liberals were always pointed out by Sean Hannity and the alike, but I started seeing them with the conservative parties too. By my junior year in high school I would describe my views as ultra-conservative. It wasn't the Republicans definition of conservative. It was my own, because I couldn't understand how a party that preached liberty would say that being gay was wrong. I came to the conclusion that the government should only be their for the most basic of things; roads, military and schools.\n\nAfter I was out of school for a few years (age of 19) I kept reading political writings and history books. I came to the conclusion that government was inherently wrong. Thinking back it was the initiation of force, although I never called it this. It wasn't until I discovered anarchism that I understood it was the initiation of force that made me question the validity of government. By 20 I considered my self an anarchist, and shortly after I identified as an An-cap.\n\nMy end conclusion is that I can see how atheism and anarchism can be related to an individual who followed a similar path. I don't believe that they are dependent on each other. I think that the biggest relation between the two is the questioning of everything, the quest for no logical inconsistencies.\n\nI hope that this is about what you were looking for and I didn't waste your time :P  In mathematics if you make an error in your proof you can prove anything. For example, if you divide by zero and end up with 1=2, you can prove that any number is equal to any other number through addition, subtraction, division, etc. \n\nIt works the same way with self-contradictory concepts like god, free will and objective morality. By \"infecting\" people with a concept which has no objective meaning because it is self-contradictory, you can force people into a mental box out of which they cannot get out unless they discard the concept entirely. Furthermore, using a self-contradictory concept you can justify anything and everything. This is a very powerful tool in the hands of the right people -- you can see how it's used in the church.\n\nI believe the state is also such a concept. Once you have a little bit of state, it can use itself to justify more and more of itself. If you open the door even a little bit, it swings wide open. \n\nSo here's my timeline:\n\n - t-20 years: I grow up in a non-religious family.\n - t-15 years: I call myself an agnostic.\n - t-10 years: I call myself an atheist.\n - t-2 years: I realize the concept of free-will is incompatible with my understanding of the universe. I discard it.\n - t-0.5 years: I reject the state\n - t-0: Objective ethics is a nonsensical concept. I discard it as well.\n\nThere were other red pills along the way: Such as revisionist history, mainstream economics, and how poorly men are treated in our society.   [deleted] Did you lose your religion, or your statism first?     I guess I'm in a minority. I'm an agnostic. I know Jeffery Tucker is Catholic, and I think Tom Woods is religious.

Besides the three of us, I guess the ancap religious community is barren.\n\n:( Agnostic is not an answer to the question whose answers range from theist to atheist. Agnostics can believe in supernatural entities, they just posit that we can't truly know or justify their existence.\n\nI for one do believe there might be something there. It probably doesn't do anything, given that the universe follows quantum mechanics and fractals and is not predestined or well controlled, so whatever supernatural entity exists is one that is libertarian. It doesn't do any governing. Besides those things, I don't know what it does or what it looks like or if it even cares about me, and I'm not deeply concerned that I don't know. Agnostic means to 'not know,' it says nothing about belief.  I did not say that there were not agnostic theists (an agnostic atheists), but agnostic is not an answer to the question 'what do you believe?'  You are an agnostic-deist (apparently). Thank you for nitpicking. I'll define myself better for you in the future. I simply corrected you for using the wrong words.  If you would like to continue to sound like you have no idea what the words you are using mean, by all means continue to do so. You didn't correct me in the first post because you didn't say how I was wrong or how I might be made correct. I guess I'm in a minority. I'm an agnostic. I know Jeffery Tucker is Catholic, and I think Tom Woods is religious. Besides the three of us, I guess the ancap religious community is barren.\n\n:( Tom Woods is Catholic, he's written several books on Catholicism too. Tucker, as you said, is Catholic. Robert Murphy is (born-again?) Christian. Myself and others here are religious, it's not contradictory like some will claim to reject the state but not god. &gt; Myself and others here are religious, it's not contradictory like some will claim to reject the state but not god.\n\nIt isn't **necessarily** contradictory. According to the understanding of God held by some, it would be contradictory (for them, that is).  I suppose my exact phrasing should be \"*inherently* contradictory,\" just as I believe that corporations are not *inherent* creations of the state. The exact formation of many things can become contradictory if one also rejects state authority, though even then depending on *why* one rejects state authority.   I consider myself ancap while being Buddhist. It's very funny how many things in Buddhism can collide with anarcho-capitalism. Ooo, I'm interested in learning about those collisions! I consider myself ancap while being Buddhist. It's very funny how many things in Buddhism can collide with anarcho-capitalism. Ah, that makes more sense, I took \"collisions\" to mean \"do not agree\".      &gt;Christian Anarcho-capitalists\n\nJesus would be *so* pissed..\n\n&gt;Luke 6:20-21 Then he looked up at his disciples and said: 'Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. 'Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled. 'Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.   I think there is a huge difference between God and man and thus there is a huge difference between rejecting either of them.\n\nWhen an atheist rejects God, he is making a declaration about the existence of something. He has faith that his claims will not be disproven, and the theist is making a similar claim. Neither side has been definitively proven and probably never will be. \n\nAnarchism is a belief in which you reject the idea that *men* have the right to tell you what to do and how to live. It deals in the physical world while theism deals in the extra-physical or supernatural. \n\nIn short, being an atheist is a statement as to whether something exists, while being an anarchist is a statement as to whether certain actions of men are acceptable. Rejecting the actions of men does not necessarily lead to rejecting the existence of a supernatural being that by definition would be incredibly different than man.  No, as the old saying goes, claiming that atheism is a faith is like claiming that \"bald\" is a hair color. There have been hundreds, probably thousands of gods that people have apparently believed in. It's like believing in My Little Ponies, there's not even a reason to look at it twice. Unless you're really amused by somewhat disconcertingly sexualized pink ponies designed for young girls.\n\nWould you defend a man who seriously claims to believe in the tooth fairy? Would you pretend it was irrational to disbelieve that the tooth fairy exists? Would you invent a new word for non-tooth-fairy believers? Would you say such men had faith in the non-existence of a tooth fairy? What shall we call them, acuspids? adonts? Afairieists!\n\nYes! I have faith in the non-existence of the tooth fairy! I praise the nonexistence of this thing on my holy toothbrush!\n\nBut, when it comes down to it, the biggest joke, the one with the most massive and implausible hubris, was the scientist who got away with naming our species \"homo sapiens sapiens\". \"Wise, wise man.\"\n\nLet's face it, people are a long way from wise. The distinguishing characteristic of people is that, unlike your average animal, we have no season of \"heat\". We can have sex at any time. Therefore, I propose changing the name to \"homo sexual sexual\".\n\n(Possibly having too much fun with this argument. You are permitted to giggle.)\n\n/cough. You're welcome. I describe atheism as a faith because it has exactly as much proof as christianity or any other religion does. IF you can definitively say that there is no god and prove it then I would rescind my claim. But you claim that there is none, another claims that there is one that exists beyond our understanding neither of you have any more proof than the other. Atheists are making a claim on the faith that nobody will prove the existence of a god.  Then you do not understand the burden of proof or a null hypothesis. Null hypothesis has nothing to do with proof. It has to do with the probability.\n\nBurden of proof lies with the person making the claim. If you claim there is a god then you should prove it. If you claim there is no god, you should prove it as well. Neither side has any proof to their claim. Yeah... You have no idea what you are talking about.\n\nA null hypothesis can not be proved.  It is what is left when positive assertions are not upheld.  The burden of proof does lie with the person making a claim, but atheism is a null hypothesis.  Atheists do not claim there are certainly and could not be gods unless they are gnostic atheists (which are very rare and not what is typically meant by atheist), they claim they do not *believe* in god/s.  Typically they say this with the justification that theists have simply not met the burden of proof, and that is a completely sound justification for agnostic atheism (which is the overwhelming majority of atheists). So help me out here.  I walk into a room and I see a book lying on a table and start to read it.  It has amazing poetry, great illustrations, well put together.  I assume it was written by someone.\n\nI walk into the next room and I see the schematic for a processor.  I assume someone or some group designed that processor.\n\nOver and over again, I see a complex system which doesn't appear to be a result of entropy.  I'm fully aware that my brain wishes to see order where there may be disorder... I'm fully aware of the God of the gaps theory.  But when I look at the universe and ask how it appeared, where does the burden of proof lie?\n\nOn one hand we have Occam's razor which suggests that the most simple answer is likely the right one, and on the other we have evidence of complex theories surrounding the big bang and possibly hints towards a multiverse.  Looking at Occam's razor, my simple mind says the simple answer is that it was designed as every other complex system we see has been designed.  Looking at the origins of the universe or multiverse is fascinating, but it itself doesn't preclude that those origins themselves weren't designed.  \n\nI can't say that I do have any answers... but I do think that we need to put the issue of gods aside and look at the origins of the universe or multiverse.  Wouldn't it be correct to push the burden of proof on either party, one that suggests there is a creator or one that suggests there isn't?   &gt;But when I look at the universe and ask how it appeared, where does the burden of proof lie?\n\nWith the person making the positive claim.\n&gt;On one hand we have Occam's razor which suggests that the most simple answer is likely the right one, and on the other we have evidence of complex theories surrounding the big bang and possibly hints towards a multiverse.

The [claims](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html) the big bang cosmologists make are backed by observation (cosmic microwave background, expanding universe, etc.).  The claims that a god/gods made the universe can not be verified as no god/gods have ever been observed.\n\nYour design argument is flawed.  We know the book and the processor were designed because we have past evidence of humans designing them.  We do not have past evidence of a god designing a universe or anything else (and we probably could not have that knowledge).  For instance, you would not need much of an argument to deny the claim that giant hermit crabs which have a subterranean and secretive civilization [(think southpark crab people)](http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/154111/crab-people) made that book or that processor because that notion is absurd.\n&gt;I can't say that I do have any answers... but I do think that we need to put the issue of gods aside and look at the origins of the universe or multiverse. Wouldn't it be correct to push the burden of proof on either party, one that suggests there is a creator or one that suggests there isn't?\n\nNo.  The scientists have met the burden for their claims which do not talk about anything before very very soon after the universe begins to expand.  They will continue to look for refining their understanding by making more observations.  Creationists claim knowledge of something from before time.  That idea is rationally absurd (and unphysical).  The burden of proof is theirs and it has not been met.\n &gt;With the person making the positive claim.\n\nAnd as such, if we are to ask what spurred the multiverse, anyone who makes a positive claim that says it spontaneously appeared would have that burden of proof. \n\n&gt;This is an argument from ignorance. The claims the big bang cosmologists make are backed by observation (cosmic microwave background, expanding universe, etc.). The claims that a god/gods made the universe can not be verified as no god/gods have ever been observed.\n\nYes, there is evidence of the big bang... which does not preclude it from being a designed event.  I realize this brings us to the who created the creator argument, but we're not talking about the creation so much as the burden of proof and who is making a positive claim.\n\n&gt;Your design argument is flawed. We know the book and the processor were designed because we have past evidence of humans designing them. We do not have past evidence of a god designing a universe or anything else (and we probably could not have that knowledge).\n\nYet if we happen upon a new complex system in a cave which has never been observed before, our first assumption isn't that it spontaneously appeared.  It is not the item that we know exists, it's the evidence of design that leads some of us to believe that it was created.  \n\n&gt;No. The scientists have met the burden for their claims which do not talk about anything before very very soon after the universe begins to expand. They will continue to look for refining their understanding by making more observations. Creationists claim knowledge of something from before time. That idea is rationally absurd (and unphysical). The burden of proof is theirs and it has not been met.\n\nYet there are hypothesis which suggest that it's possible to test and see if we live within a simulation.  It's not irrational to think there was a designer of the system in which we live in today... even if it is a belief.  The only intellectually honest answer is not claiming to know.  \n\nI think you want to cloud the issue with notions of gods and supernatural events, which are all moot.  We can agree that either one of us can come up with imaginary and untestable ideas and the burden of proof falls on us.  But actual creation can be testable, as we see in the simulation experiments. I describe atheism as a faith because it has exactly as much proof as christianity or any other religion does. IF you can definitively say that there is no god and prove it then I would rescind my claim. But you claim that there is none, another claims that there is one that exists beyond our understanding neither of you have any more proof than the other. Atheists are making a claim on the faith that nobody will prove the existence of a god.  Boat, old feller, I believe you have been excessively and wrongfully downvoted, so you have my upvotes. But you are confused on the nature of logic. There is no reason to believe in invisible spirits, the burden of proof is on you if you wish to claim that they exist. We do not need to prove the lack of existence of something for which there is no evidence. There's no point in it.\n\nYour first trial case ought to be to prove the existence of a tooth fairy. That ought to be a hell of a lot easier than demonstrating there's one or more gods. ",

    "title" : "Who is the state?",
    "snippet" : "Under a monarchy or otherwise totalitarian regime, the link between \"the state\" and \"the government\" is pretty apparent.  In our current democratic system this isn't necessarily the case.  When voters exercise some control over who is in power, term lengths are (relatively) limited, and governmental power cannot be (directly) passed to one's children, who is the state?\n\nAll anarchists want to abolish the state, but I have trouble defining exactly who that is.  The president, senate, and congress are certainly part of it.  What about postal workers?  What about welfare recipients?  What about lobbyists?    \n\nI am bringing this question up, because I think it may help elucidate some of the fundamental differences and communication problems seen between anarcho-capitalists and other anarchists.\n\nAfter spending more time reading ansoc comments lately, I'm pretty sure when they say \"State\" they mean \"rich people\" or \"the 1%\" (lurking socialists feel free to correct me if I am wrong here).  As I understand it, the anarcho capitalists' conception of \"The State\" is the use of the [political means](http://www.masterresource.org/2011/06/economic-vs-political-means-oppenheimer/).  Everyone, from the president, to the lobbyist, to the voter, to the welfare mom is \"The State\" to the extent that they engage in the political means.\n\nDoes this sound correct?  Is this useful?\n\nFor me, trying to understand how ancaps and ansocs would define \"The State\" makes it very clear that they have effectively no real common ground.  Both groups are striving to eliminate something completely different.  Ancaps are happy with a disproportionate distribution of wealth as long as it was achieved voluntarily.  Ansocs are happy with the use of the political means, as long as the wealth and power backing its use is egalitarianly distributed. \n\nJust for fun...   I am a Georgist.  When I think about \"The State\", I am thinking about \"land owners\", the government being the largest (and ultimately the only true land owner).  For whatever reason, this conception leaves me much more comfortable with ancaps than ansocs.    The state is the institution holding a monopoly on the use of force. No, the state is an idea (a dangerous one), the government is the institution. No, the state is an idea (a dangerous one), the government is the institution.  I consider all agents of the state, meaning every police officer, soldier, office clerk, IRS accountant, postal worker, politician, teacher, and janitor, an enemy. If you actively work for the state as an employee, you are part of the enemy forces. Public \"servants\" are the state, they are the ones who possess legal privileges. \n\nVoters and other proponents of the state as an institution are by default collaborators, unless they are actually acting for libertarian reasons (voting for a lesser of evils or teaching libertarian ideas at a public university, for example).   The state does not exist. It's not a thing out in reality. It is a belief held by some people, which motivates certain statist behaviors. For the context of my question, see my comment in this thread.\n\nIf we are to change the behavior of individuals, it would seem there are two possible ways corresponding to two kinds of people: (1) For the people who value, as we do, the ends of peace and prosperity, among other compatible values, we would have to convince them scientifically (that is, in a value-free way) that what they advocate (statism) will ultimately *not* bring about their ends - that we propose a better alternative means. (2) For the people who do not value what we do, we would have to change their ends to align with ours.\n\nThe first kind of discussion seems straightforward, so it is the second I'm asking you about. Are such conversations futile? Is a conversation about ends futile altogether? I suppose part of answering my question involves the source of values in the first place - what do you think it is? Feel free to leave your answer open ended, since my question is so... I don't believe there is such a thing as process 2. There is only process 1. However, I believe basic values are far more compatible upon consideration of internal inconsistencies (a la process 1) than it seems on first glance. &gt;I don't believe there is such a thing as process 2. There is only process 1.\n\nMeaning...people with values incompatible with peace and prosperity truly don't exist? - or that having discussions with those people are futile? I think that if such a person exists, trying to convince them is futile.\n\nOf course it takes an awful long time of interrogation before it's possible to figure out if a person you meet does have such incompatible values, so in practical terms it's hard to say when it is or is not futile to continue discussion. The state does not exist. It's not a thing out in reality. It is a belief held by some people, which motivates certain statist behaviors.   They seem to think of the \"state\" as being the political community as a whole (i.e. all the citizens of a country); the \"government\" being the administrative agent of this body. This way it is actually \"the people\" who jointly have sovereign control over an area. They do not want to absolve this entity; but rather focus on the government, which is ideally an agent of the people, but currently imposes its rule, overriding the legitimate control of the people. It should therefore be abolished giving everybody direct democratic control of the State. Sort of as if every single citizen was a member of the relevant congress or parliament.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nThe ancap conception is the current people \"in government\". Their claim is not to own land per se, but to have the monopoly on force and final decision making in their territory. &gt;They seem to think of the \"state\" as being the political community as a whole...\n\nIs \"they\" ansocs here?  So would everyone having a vote-box in their house, which they regularly use to \"vote\" on laws put forth by (?) fit your description?  That doesn't really sound like \"anarchism\" as usually defined.\n\n&gt;The ancap conception is the current people \"in government\". Their claim is not to own land per se, but to have the monopoly on force and final decision making in their territory.\n\nAlthough, both ancaps and ansocs deem monopoly on the use of force within owned territory legitimate.  In order to live in an ancap's territory, you must except his rules, leave, or be forced out.  Ansoc advocate the same, but the territory is owned by \"the community\".\n\n &gt; Is \"they\" ansocs here? So would everyone having a vote-box in their house, which they regularly use to \"vote\" on laws put forth by (?) fit your description? That doesn't really sound like \"anarchism\" as usually defined.\n\nOr anarcho-communists, syndicalists, I don't care. The lefty anarchists.\n\nWell, this is what I gather from my conversations with them. They are really confused as to the nature of the state. Just ask them to define it and why it is bad. They always obsess about these \"direct democracy\" solutions.\n\n&gt; Although, both ancaps and ansocs deem monopoly on the use of force within owned territory legitimate. In order to live in an ancap's territory, you must except his rules, leave, or be forced out.\n\nNo this is not what a monopoly on force is about. Firstly, we speak of owning land in anarcho-capitalism, not owning territory. \"Owning territory\" is statist terminology for having \"legitimate\" sovereign control over a territory (monopoly on force). What you're talking about is the right to land ownership; i.e. if I do own my land, then I have the right to force you out for not following my rules. This is not a monopoly on force since if I had that, then I could commit crimes on my land and I would always be in the right. Doesn't matter what I'd do; since I'm sovereign, or \"king\" of my land. This is what a state does. &gt;Firstly, we speak of owning land in anarcho-capitalism, not owning territory.\n\nSure, but I would call territory a subset of land.  Land is all preexisting surface area and natural resources.  Territory is the XY plane of that someone claims dominion over.  Whatever terms we use, ancaps to advocate for \"territory ownership\".   \n\n&gt;This is not a monopoly on force since if I had that, then I could commit crimes on my land and I would always be in the right. Doesn't matter what I'd do; since I'm sovereign, or \"king\" of my land. This is what a state does.\n\nThe only distinction I can see is that an ancap landowner gained that land \"legitimately\" with respect to the homesteading principle where a state did not.  \n\nI don't think even the most absurd statist would claim that a state is morally just when it wantonly slaughters citizens or commits many other atrocities.  When states do this, people call for outside intervention, just as they would for landowning ancaps committing atrocities on their land.  You certainly wouldn't disagree that there are certain kinds of force that a land owner has legitimate monopoly privileges to.  He can say, \"play be the rules or leave, and if you don't leave, I will force you out\".  Those rules can be everything from taxation (\"rent\") to slavery. &gt; The only distinction I can see is that an ancap landowner gained that land \"legitimately\" with respect to the homesteading principle where a state did not.\n\nWe're talking about what the state actually is. How it is defined.\n\nA landowner is just a person that owns land.\n\nA state is a group of people jointly declaring ultimate decision making power over some territory.\n\nThe former power can be lawful. The latter cannot be lawful since it is by definition a claim to ignore the law. It is always a claim by force.\n\n\n&gt; I don't think even the most absurd statist would claim that a state is morally just when it wantonly slaughters citizens or commits many other atrocities.\n\nDoesn't matter. The state claims the right to \"wantonly slaughter citizens\". By definition. It is an evil entity.\n\n&gt; You certainly wouldn't disagree that there are certain kinds of force that a land owner has legitimate monopoly privileges to.\n\nIt's just a right for the owner to own his land in peace. That includes the right to force people off of it if necessary. And rent is not taxation. Taxation is theft.\n\nPs this is literally the most common conflation I see amongst many ancaps. What you're talking about is actually monarchism, i.e. I can become king over a land provided I legitimately claim it by homesteading. This is decidedly not anarchism (and actually nonsensical since if I actually were the king then I could choose to ignore the rules of legitimate acquisition. Since I'm the final lawmaker.) I am not seeing the distinction.\n\nIn the current state system you have two options.  Pay \"rent\"/\"taxes\" (whatever term you want to use for the fee for staying within the territory) and obey its laws, or leave.  An ancap landowner is free to operate on exactly those same principles.  People \"voluntarily\" lived under monarchical states because there was no better land for them to occupy, just as people would voluntarily live under ancap landowners who impose a \"social contract\" as a fee for sleeping in that territory.   &gt; Pay \"rent\"/\"taxes\" (whatever term you want to use for the fee for staying within the territory) and obey its laws, or leave.\n\nYou're not seeing what the state really is. What you are implying here is that if I break or don't follow any of the state's rules (or \"laws\") then I must leave the territory. I.e. be deported.\n\nThis literally implies that I can upset the state as much as I want, by e.g. not paying taxes or doing drugs or assault people, and the only thing it can do to me is kick me out of the country.\n\nThis means that imprisonment is kidnap. (which it is). Since every prisoner has the right to leave the country.\n\nYet nobody questions the state's right to imprison people.\n\nYou must see this. It is an absolute myth that states are about \"owning a territory\". They are about ruling a conquered area by force.   ",

    "snippet" : "  Wow, they're so uptight.  Not just gun control, but socially as well. That's merely a tactic they use to control the behavior of others. Wow, they're so uptight.  Not just gun control, but socially as well. Wow, they're so uptight.  Not just gun control, but socially as well.  strikes me as astroturf.\n\nAlso it's rather scarey that they are so herd like and immune to reasoned discussion.  YES WE WILL! YES WE WILL! YES WE WILL!  I wonder what they think of themselves later that night. Do they feel that they made a good contribution to the world or do they feel a little embarrassed? Sorry, but they don't think. They feel. And they feel they are right. You cannot fight that with logic. I wonder what they think of themselves later that night. Do they feel that they made a good contribution to the world or do they feel a little embarrassed? Thats a good question. I hope Adam made at least one of them think critically in the back of their mind for a minute so they could think about how moronic they are.  YES WE WILL! YES WE WILL! YES WE WILL!   I liked how he kept asking \"how are you going to take my guns\" and nobody answered him. They did answer him, with the twin responses of yes we will take your guns, and nobody is for taking your guns. The question was \"How?\" Hey, i said that how they responded, not that they answered the question. They did answer him, with the twin responses of yes we will take your guns, and nobody is for taking your guns.  I'll say again, \"Court the soccer moms and you have a country by the balls.\" ... because they have nothing else to do other than lobby representatives and government officials. I don't even mean to suggest that they're a powerful (moneyed) lobbying group, even had they the time.  But, they play a significant role in the shaping of the family, act as the central vein therein, and from which a politician or policy-maker could measure the pulse and emotional psyche of a country while seeking to manipulate it.\n\nWe all know the State lives on fear. It should then stand to reason the courting of this most emotional and easily scared demographic is one of the most cost-effective means of expanding the State's granted legitimacy. and there seems to be few groups more fearful than soccer moms. Do you have any examples? of fearful soccer moms? Sure, I have some anecdotes. Where I grew up a group of soccer moms organized and nagged the government to put cages over all the storm drains because there was an incident somewhere in the country when some kid drowned in a canal. The town relented, put cages on the storm drains, which led to the drains getting clogged, and it flooded a sizable area (I heard a kid almost drowned in the resulting quick moving water in other areas but I don't know if it was true).\n\nIn a similar incident, the soccer mom group also harassed and nagged someone in our neighborhood because he was a \"sex offender.\" Think of the children he may attack! Guess why he was a sex offender? He had sex with his girlfriend when he was young (otherwise legally) in a car and the police caught them. They harassed the man until he moved (including vandalism, threats, etc.).\n\nedit: The mom's originally wanted the city to put a fence around bodies of water, but the town said \"lolno, that would cost a fortune... and not prevent people from simply jumping the fence\" lol, I completely mistook your reply that mine was in reply to to have been sarcasm; I thought you were criticizing my characterization of soccer moms as one of the most emotionally-impelled and easily fearful demographic.\n\nSo, I was asking for examples of more fearful groups as a challenge of that critique.  But, your examples were nonetheless interesting.       Yeah, the whole \"how are you going to take the guns\" question is really the only one you need to stump or trap them in their own terms.\n\nBasically it breaks down to this:\n\nBan the transfer, manufacture, and ownership of them with an exception for pre-owned (grandfathered) ones. There are, give or take, 300 million firearms in the U.S. A well-maintained gun will easily last a century, and repair is trivially easy if you know what you're doing. You *might* achieve your gun-free utopia by the year 2400 at this rate.\n\nOR\n\nBan and actively confiscate firearms at all times. Now lets give the ATF some credit and say they manage to confiscate 5 million firearms a year on average. Hell, lets give 'em superheroic powers and broad enforcement abilities that ignore the fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments (which they'll do anyway) so they can up that to 10 million guns per year. Its still going to be THIRTY YEARS before you get the last gun off the streets. And DURING that time millions of people will have rights infringed and in all likelihood violence will *increase* when you get clashes between armed citizens and police. And lets forget arms smuggling. How can a country that can't keep drugs from crossing its borders control firearms that are *already here?*\n\n Of course there are somewhat 'intermediate' solutions like buybacks and ammo restriction and registration, but we all know that the confiscation will have to be the endgoal. A mere ban will, as above, not achieve the results they crave in any reasonable timeframe. Eventually an active 'war' on guns will be the politically and societally popular choice. And we all know what happens when the Gov't declares war on anything.\n\n So THAT is why they cannot and will not answer the question of 'how will you take my guns?' They either have to tacitly admit that their proposed changes are going to be functionally useless for the foreseeable future, OR they have to openly admit that they don't give a damn for ANY rights and are completely fine with violating almost every constitutional protection that remains in pursuit of their 'violence-free utopia.'     How do they they know there are exactly one million moms? Do they turn people away once they reach a million? What happens if not enough show up? How misogynist.      ",

    "snippet" : "Every day my facebook account is bombarded with statist ideology: radfem bullshit, military-inspired nationalism, friends posting shit like \"guns are for pussies\" and calling for gun control even though they know I own guns.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking about this lately and I came to the realization that I have no friends IRL, other than my brother and girlfriend, who are actually ancap, libertarian-friendly or at least don't hold non-authoritarian beliefs. Not a single one. And I say nothing because I know if I do, in spite of the fact that they claim to be open-minded (*cough* bullshit *cough*), I would soon find myself friendless, so I just put up with it and say nothing.\n\nToday after yet another day of seeing my page bombarded with toxic ideology I finally had enough. I unfriended them and deleted my account. I need to start over and find friends who aren't complete assholes and who aren't willing to call for violence against me. \n\nThe only thing I feel about it right now is a sense of relief. How do you guys put up with this constant shit? Where do you find friends who aren't shitty?\n\n**EDIT** Corrected spelling \"fiends\" instead of \"friends\" - even though it isn't far from the truth...  You have social problems that have nothing to do with ideology. Honestly, if you can't even handle seeing other opinions, you're never going to get anywhere; in fact it doesn't seem like you really **want** to get anywhere with non-libertarians. Act your age! Debate! Engage!\n\n&gt; Where do you find friends who aren't shitty?\n\nDisagreeing with me doesn't make someone a shitty friend. My father is the only other libertarian I know. My two best friends are hardcore progressives. Guess what! Disagreement makes friendship interesting! I argue with them all the time, and we enjoy it. I also post articles and opinions on Facebook every day and debate plenty of \"statists\" there--most of whom are also good friends of mine!\n\nIt seems like too many of us want to insulate ourselves from the real world, live in a bubble, and circlejerk. Disowning your friends--and especially your parents--because they disagree with you is extremely childish. I subscribe to /r/socialism, /r/progressive, and /r/politics, as well as /r/new_right and /r/conservative for a full range of perspectives, and I encourage you to do the same. It might be painful at first, but you'll learn to appreciate it.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that most progressives agree with us on important issues like the War on Terror and the War on Drugs, even if they aren't consistent enough to remove support from Obama. I wonder if this is mostly about lack of social skills and an anti-authoritarian intolerance more than anything else. My own past is littered with failed social interactions, so much so that I sometimes wonder if I am an AnCap because I hate people and just want to rationalize that into a political ideology. Note that just like Progressivism attracts the envious, so Anarchism attracts the anti-authoritarian, guys, and adjust your behavior accordingly. Be a Billy Graham and sacrifice your angularity for access. I'll be the first to admit I have poor social skills. That's why I ended up sticking with friends I knew from high school instead of branching out.  Unfortunately the older I get the more difficult it becomes to meet new people and we have no interests in common anymore. I've tried arguing with them in the past in a friendly and open manner, but it just leads to hatred and backstabbing. \n\nOne of them even created a website about me where he attacked me personally because I wanted to write a video game (of all things) and some of the others joined in on. We're not talking about people who can carry on a rational conversation. We're talking about glad-hands who clam up in a real debate and then attack you in the most passive-aggressive fashion if by trying to undermine your self-esteem and self-confidence. I've lost all energy for trying. I don't hate them. I just can't deal with it anymore. You have social problems that have nothing to do with ideology.

If I was so adverse to seeing other opinions, I wouldn't be posting on reddit. The plain fact of the matter is that they are shitty friends. I detailed how they act in another post. If I came out of the closet and revealed all of my beliefs, I know I'd be dropped just like that. Part of the problem is they are incapable of acting in a mature fashion or debating things without becoming full of rage and their politics, as I indicated in another post, are guided almost entirely by their attitudes. What do I expect to learn from a loser who lives on welfare, sponges off his friends, and thinks rich people should be executed? What do I expect to learn from a cult member whose uninformed opinions and urgings led to the death of his own mother, who supports school shooters who are asian? What do I expect to learn from someone who fills my IM with uninterrupted complaints about her mental problems and is full of sexist/racist vitriol? What do I expect to learn from someone who thinks \"guns are for pussies\"? \n\nIf they even made an attempt to actually debate instead of just saying nasty shit, that would be one thing - but it's not a sign of immaturity that I abandon them. It's a sign of immaturity that I subject myself to their drivel to no gain whatsoever because they're toxic individuals and I've grown beyond that. I'm tired of seeing hate-filled rants that indirectly attack me. Why are you in the closet in the first place? If your friends are so shitty, why are you worried about being \"dropped\"? I suppose I was worried about being dropped because then I'd have no one. It's like the concept of being in a prison. Social interaction is so important that if someone throws you in solitary you'll be begging for a chance to speak to hardened criminals. Maybe I shouldn't care if I get dropped, but there's not much point going out in a blaze of glory. I'd just get mobbed and they'd continue on like I don't exist.\n\n I suppose I was worried about being dropped because then I'd have no one. It's like the concept of being in a prison.

I told my new newroommate that I cannot stand to be around  political television. This was after he put Rachel Maddow on on my beautiful, slim, Korean made, LED backlit, LCD HDTV. *Seriously, there should be a law against that!/s*\n\nWell done to assert that an appreciation of non violence is a standard that you are going to hold your best friends to. Why do your friends' political views matter unless they affect you?\n\nI can see not dealing with stringent feminist or racialists if they try to censor what you say. But in general I don't see how it makes sense to not be friends with mainline democrats/republicans. Lots of life has nothing to do with politics.  You're not just talking theory when someone goes out and votes to do harm to you. In fact, of all the Marxists I've personally known (which is somewhere around 20), 100% of them are thieves by their own admission.\n\nWhile I am aware that this is just an anecdote and will not be true of everyone of a given political persuasion, what it does tell me is that one's quality as a friend often aligns with one's political beliefs. Thus, if you believe private property is valid and should be honored, you're less likely to steal from me. Sometimes politics is a proxy for people to admit they're shitty people while still being able to hide behind the oh-we're-just-talking-politics-LOL refrain.\n I actually agree with the above commenter as well. There are innumerable differences among people and removing entire groups of people from your sphere of interaction, just based on any one of an arbitrary list of beliefs will not help you lead the most rich, full, and productive life as possible.\n\nI think it's good to hold that our best friends are people open to the perspectives that we hold dear, that we find important. But doing business, playing sports with, playing video games with, talking about other hobbies, or anything else with non voluntarist friends; I have no problem with that.\n\n*The philosophy of liberty should help you find new friends, it should help you make sense of the world around you, it should help you sleep better at night. But it should not make you a recluse. It should be a plus, not a negative.*\nedit: phone typos I get what you're saying but I don't really consider such people friends. I consider them acquaintances.  Fair enough. Sometimes I'll think of them as 'arm's length friends,' 'people that I do x with,' 'studying partners,' people I commiserate with,' 'work friends,' family friends, and 'friends that are slowly moving towards voluntarism with my help' or 'people slowly moving out of my circle of friends.'\n\nBasically, the people that I generally hope well for they generally hope the best for me.\n\nI don't let race, orientation, ethnicity, country of origin, hobbies, gender, occupation or politics get in the way of my interaction or possible friendship.

Stefan Molyneux is waiting for you with open arms. Even with his flaws displayed prominently on this subreddit, he is still a thousand times better a friend to me than any of my current friends, and he doesn't even know me. Just pay him money and he'll be your bro. What's the going rate for crossing the bridge these days? Anything over $2 it seems. Hahah. At least give the loch ness monster three fiddy.\n\n  I'm a graduate student in Germany. I was drowning in welfare statist and interventionist sentiments and \"why would you want to kill people? (I own guns and apparently they have no other purpose). I've presented Mises and Hayek numerous times to looks of horror and confusion. The idea of reducing the State (or eliminating it entirely) is a toxic idea here. It is painful because their defensive of their beliefs is awful. \"Libertarians/Minarchists/AnCaps want people to starve and be poor!\" and \"Central planning can fix the economy and end poverty!\" are just a few of the things I can hear daily.\n\nAt first I had discussions with them questioning their beliefs- unsuccessful. Now I just make my views as \"extreme\" as possible for fun. Legalize machine guns, abolish the State, etc. It is more fun this way. Luckily I  saw a guy walking around in a hoodie that said \"Anarchy - Capitalism - Freedom\" and discovered that there are AnCaps on campus. \n\nTL:DR Classmates were too statist to be my friends, moved on. Where in Germany?  I will be at a Leipzig University on and off for the next couple years, and was curious about the \"political\" climate.  I assume it will be pretty aggressively statist.   Hamburg for the Politics, Economics, Philosophy program. German culture is more authority-centric (at least more openly so) than American culture, so you have to take that into account. Friendly and helpful people. However, most anti-state sentiments you express will be misinterpreted. Germans are wary of political extremism. \"Anarchists\" in Germany are not too different from the \"anarchists\" in the US, but they are more prominent and active. Graffiti, vandalism, burning cars, \"black bloc\" tactics, domestic terrorism. So I would recommend not using the word until you have explained your positions first. Questioning the government is a strange concept for them. You can question policies all day and they will have lively debates, but asking if the State should have the authority to do something will get you a funny look. Obama is also somewhat of a hero, even the German 'conservatives' and 'liberals' will be pro-Obama. Individualism is largely nonsense to them. \n\nSince Leipzig is in the former DDR, you will have a slightly different experience. I lived in the East for a while and discovered that many of them have less respect for the State due to the DDR and the politics of Reunification. Tread carefully, it can be a sensitive subject. \n\nOf course, this should all be taken with a grain of salt. Experiences will vary. Unless you run into a hardliner, which you will do at least once, debates will be cordial, but lively. \n\nNote: When I said I \"moved on,\" I did so because of a discussion of US politics (Germans love discussing US politics) and the consensus was that \"assault weapons\" should be seized door-to-door. I try not to base my friendships based on politics, but I found advocacy for Gestapo-style police statism to be too much. \n\nGermany is a wonderful place and Leipzig is a fun city, so don't let differences in political culture discourage you.  Sounds pretty consistent with my expectations.  Interesting that Germany of all places has trouble understanding distrust of government, and is comfortable with door to door weapons seizure.  It is like the whole Nazi thing never happened.  \n\nThanks for the thorough response!    trolling is a art, my friend. Don't delete your account just because you added few statists. TROLL THEM, and TROLL THEM HARD. That's my modus operandi.  Don't go burning bridges.  Otherwise, WHO WILL BUILD NEW ONES!?  I got rid of my Facebook account too. Best decision so far. Hell, most of my friends liked what I posted (with the exception of a few), and I was openly anti-theist and anti-state, though I posted under a pseudonym and gave no real personal info in my profile. I even saw a few change in their views over the course of a couple of years to less pro-state views, hopefully due to my efforts. However, childhood indoctrination is strong and hard to break and I couldn't take much of their lame posts anymore. I mean, hardly anyone was willing to actually talk about anything meaningful ([a-la this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52EnTtGstKg)). Anyway, glad to see you left that cluster-fuck too. Funny thing is out of all of the ones I friended, only two or three actually call me, hang out and talk to me, and their visits are usually punctuated by more drivel asking me if I've read *Das Kapital*, or talking about who they want to kill today. Jesus Christ. Where the hell do you live that's keeping all these sociopaths? Omaha, Nebraska - most of them informed by TV, given the remarkable similarity of their opinions to Rachel Maddow or some other fuckhead statist. There's a reason it's called TV *programming*.\n\n Funny thing is out of all of the ones I friended, only two or three actually call me, hang out and talk to me, and their visits are usually punctuated by more drivel asking me if I've read *Das Kapital*, or talking about who they want to kill today.  Dude,  you just dropped the only ball in the game.  The only way anarcho-capitalistic ideas spread is by teaching,  guiding,  and allowing other people the repeated exposure of these ideas.  Ideas that are essentially contrary to everything humans have been taught for millenia.  This is a slow process that can take years for an individual.  We have the moral high ground and most people are moral.  So it's a matter of ignorance we are dealing with,  not foaming-at- the-mouth state loving fascists. Patience is a virtue.   I tend to keep my promotion of ancap strictly in the commercial realm. I don't believe the political problem can be solved by engaging in politics. To me it's a fool's bargain. If I'm going to promote market solutions, then why not promote them through the market? Your mileage may vary.  Come hang out with us on the r/civcraft [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) server. Also, where are you located?  \"Oh dear, can't you see?

Honestly I can't think of anything of value that they have added to my life.\n\n&gt;Maybe I am simply blessed with a group of friends that are simply good people; they have generally followed me as I became more and more anti-state.\n\nConsider yourself lucky. I've had more support and encouragement from people like yourself and others over the years in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism than I ever received in my real life. If anything most of them disappeared into the internet and took on the characteristics of the many people here on reddit who annoy the hell out of me on a daily basis. Some of them actually post on reddit too, so I wonder how many times I've argued with them without even knowing it.\n\n\n Just remember that political ideologies do not make good friends. I have met quite a few people who had similar political ideologies, but in practice they were still selfish, self-centered, uncaring, or otherwise shitty individuals. \n\nFriendships are built on bonds and bonds are built on mutual experience. I have had largely the same group of good friends since middle-school; we all played the same sport, loved camping, and the outdoors. We have always had each others backs.\n\nThe newer good friends that I have were made simply by doing things that I care about. I involved myself in organizations which I liked and I met good people there. I'm just some kid on the internet, but that would be my advice. Wish I could just disagree.

I, too, don't have any friends in real life because I don't tolerate irrational, harmful, despicable beliefs. I made it clear to my former friends why I don't want to interact with them anymore. That is interesting, because I think most people never truly take it that far. What made you actually go that far and stop being friends with people who had certain beliefs? And how does that work out for you? I've lived long periods of my life without friends, but it had nothing to do with politics. Still it makes you realize that you can actually be fine by yourself, it's not the end of the world if you don't have friends. But I imagine that's terrifying to a lot of people. \n\nRegarding being friends with people who have horrible beliefs though. Imagine having a pet, let's say a dog. You enjoy the company of your dog, but you still know that it is still an animal and it might bite your face off at any time if something goes wrong. I view people a bit like that too. It can be fun to have them around,  but always be ready for them to turn on you at any time. \n\nAlso, if you have an oppositional mentality, then it can actually be fun to hang out and have a beer with \"enemies\". My strategy is to always speak my mind at all times with brutal honesty and then other people can decide for themselves whether they want to be around that or not.  My facebook is bombarded with Bob Higg's and Jeff Tucker's daily music selection, Bob Murphy's curious stories in life, and Amanda Billyrock videos. Facebook isn't so bad ;) My facebook is bombarded with Bob Higg's and Jeff Tucker's daily music selection, Bob Murphy's curious stories in life, and Amanda Billyrock videos. Facebook isn't so bad ;)     I'm fortunate in that a large majority of my Facebook friends are libertarians or anarcho-capitalists because I went to an IHS seminar titled *Morality, Capitalism, and Freedom* last summer and I met plenty of smart small-gov't and anti-gov't individuals.\n\nI post plenty of anti-state material and don't mind it either. Maybe that's what I need to do. Ancap may not be the singular ticket to common interests, but my current batch of friends are people with whom I have nothing in common anymore and it would be nice to talk to people who are interested in the same things I am. Our common interest used to be video games, but they've largely given them up.    ",

Where are these capitalist countries you speak of? Capitalism doesn't equal corporatism.  So Capitalism has never existed, you say?  We can't know for sure, we don't have absolute knowledge of every little society on earth. But for the most part, no. Okay, and under this logic, the free market has never existed, and thus, voluntary transactions (as per your standards) have never existed as far as we know? Is this what you mean to tell me? No, I said that we don't know if it's ever existed the way we want it (Anarcho-Capitalism) but if your referring to mainstream western history, no. Right, Capitalism hasn't ever existed *the way you want it*, but it does exist today. Corporatism is still Capitalism. Corporatism is really just a three party system between the State, private enterprise owners/legal representatives and labor representation. So Capitalism has never existed, you say?  It hasn't existed during the nation state format of the past few hundred years.  And how so? I definitely see private ownership around today.

We probably don't agree, and when you define \"leftist\" and I say \"That's not 'leftist'!\" You'll simply rebut with a \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy. Been there, done that. But those were states fighting against each other. It's not like Apple and Google have been killing each the others employees. The State is just another business, albeit an involuntary one.

That \"AnCapism\" is \"Anarchism\", and that all other forms are somehow an initiation of force, and its proponents were all beaten as children. Good for you, staying objective.   By some estimates the death toll of demicide is over 160 million in the 20th century alone. Those were all statist regimes. They had nothing to do with Anarcho-Capitalism. I don't recall ever saying that \"Anarcho\"-Capitalism has killed anyone. So, what point are you trying to make in r/Anarcho_Capitalism? That capitalists have killed just as Nazis have. The only difference was perspective. We grew up on the winning side. Fascism was defeated and Capitalism reigned supreme. It's all propaganda to get us to think we're all right for being capitalists. Not that we ought to be Nazis, because we shouldn't. But my point is that while the Nazis are guilty, so are the capitalist regimes. &gt; That capitalists have killed just as Nazis have.

Then capitalists go and do it and it's all fine and dandy because we can just blame the State.

But my point is that while the Nazis are guilty, so are the capitalist regimes. We agree, the state is bad. Again, why are you bringing this up in r/Anarcho_Capitalism? Your critique is a critique of the state, not of capitalism. It wasn't capitalism that has killed people, it was capitalist *regimes*, by your own admission. You're conflating capitalism with capitalist regimes, and using the actions of the latter to criticize the former. I don't understand what point you're trying to make.

    "title" : "Have you hated collectivism today?",
    "snippet" : "When I was forced to participate in a K-12 education, I grew to hate collectivism because I realized that it dumbed me down on a daily basis. For instance, both I and my peers had to attend a Mathematics class. The problem was that, while I aced Calculus, most of my classmates even struggled with Arithmetic. So you can imagine that they felt left behind and I felt that I was wasting my time for not being allowed to forward my education. In the end, we were all worse off, since the gov't said that we must all have the same level of education, mental capacity, motivation etc.\n\nA recent foray into collectivism took place at the gym. Most gym-goers spend a lot of their time chatting endlessly with their workout buddies, while suckers like me, who go there to work out and get out in a timely fashion, have to tolerate their behavior. I cannot stop them from taking their time, because I think that that would violate the non-aggression principle. But I also can't afford not to use my time efficiently, so I decided to start doing body weight workouts at home. I think that one way to solve this issue would be to have every gym member sign a contract that stipulates under what conditions workout should take place. It seems like the civilized thing to do.\n\nIt seems that collectivism is pretty hard to escape from, considering that our species' survival has largely depended on it. The difference between 'good' collectivism and 'bad' collectivism is, I think, consent. For example, you could argue that us anacaps on this subreddit are a collective, but we participate in it voluntarily.\n\nWhat other instances of collectivism have you encountered? How do you deal with having your individualism suppressed?  I don't really hate collectivism itself. Humans are social animals after all.  Exactly, collectivism can work great when done voluntarily and with small groups. Any time you hang out with friends, participate in a team, play in a band, work on a school project with classmates, etc. are all collective efforts. It's forced collectivism with large groups where most people don't know each other that it doesn't work. I don't really hate collectivism itself. Humans are social animals after all.   Aaron Clarey's latest video points out another collectivist trend: [Aversion to telecommuting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC2KQNq6npw). Originally the boss was fine with Aason telecommuting, but once everyone else found out he had to stop.    This isn't really related to philosophy, but if you go to the gym to build muscle mass, bodyweight exercises won't help very much. They are better than nothing, but won't get you much stronger. Instead, If someone is taking too long, just ask them \"How many sets do you have left?\" and that usually pressures them non-aggressively to allow you to use the machines.   Honestly, I think I've gotten lucky. I've managed to purge my life of nearly all collectivism. Family would be the final collective standing. Not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly taxing at times.   ",

It's fairly easy with most people I know, actually, if you're not annoying about it and you can explain the principles.\n\nYou: I think most people don't even like politics, even if they don't know why.\n\nYou: They just don't follow it at all.\n\nStranger: My friends get the principles, I guess, but they get caught up in the \"who will build the roads?\" discussion\n\nStranger: And under their thinking, if they don't know how the roads will be built, the ideology is completely invalid\n\nYou: Well, I mean, that's just a practical issue. There is an explanation there, if you can word it right. I think the reason most people get dismissive is because they view it as somebody getting overly hyped up over a topic that is outside their normal sphere of living.\n\nStranger: Yep.\n\nStranger: They also get into a circular argument about how the world started in anarchy and governments exist now, so clearly governments should exist\n\nYou: Ah, yeah - I actually have a good response to that one. What do you normally say?\n\nStranger: \"That is a circular argument\"\n\nStranger: How do you respond?\n\nYou: Well, the most important thing is definitions. The first thing to do, if briefly, is to define the state - and I'll save you the explanation - but the essential connective tissue is the perceived legitimacy to use violence. Explain that however you like. Then, if you look back through history, examining the paradigm at each stage, I think that in actuality there is no massive shift where the world goes from stateless to having a state. The perceived legitimacy of violence only grows in scope, until it becomes practically universal.\n\nYou: Actually, completely universal, but that goes past our species.\n\nYou: The state of nature *is* the state.\n\nYou: What we have is just the leftovers.\n\nStranger: If I may, I'm going to play devil's advocate here, because I want to nail this argument when I use it\n\nYou: Go for it.\n\nStranger: \"Since there's no massive shift, this clearly indicates that 'society' accepts the presence of the state. When people lived in tribes, they could go off on and live on their own, but they didn't, so obviously people accepted government and if you don't like it you can go build an island in the middle of international waters and go live in peace.\"\n\nYou: Well, it just proves that it's an institution that has always existed. But it makes sense - of course, even before tribal times, even past our species, the state would exist in a state of nature without technology or advanced communication. Even though it's not centralized, even though it's not organized, that *is* the state. All the essential ingredients are there. There is the ability to rule others, not decided by your assets and connections, but by your individual strength and size - and there is the perceived legitimacy, because nobody knows better.\n\nYou: I think that the state institution we have now is just the coagulation of thousands of years of excuses for violence.\n\nYou: And you can see the general direction it's going in, in the long term at least.\n\nStranger: \"So how is abolishing the state going to change that direction? It'll just restart and history will repeat itself.\"\n\nYou: I think that's correct, actually.\n\nYou: I don't think any of it actually depends on the state as an institution. It depends on its perceived legitimacy.\n\nYou: It's all in our minds, so to speak.\n\nStranger: I think the disconnect with him is that he thinks that an anarchist would arise from an overthrow of government, rather than people outgrowing it.\n\nStranger: *anarchist society\n\nYou: Yeah - I don't think that could happen. I mean, who knows - maybe the moment of transition would *look* like an overthrow in some sense - but in essence if people still believe in the state it will still exist.\n\nStranger: You don't think which would happen?\n\nYou: Well, I don't think the ultimate cause that would transition the world into a stateless society would be overthrow. It will be a loss of faith.\n\nStranger: Agreed.\n\nStranger: He also has this idea that government gets better and better over time because people can vote, and that a market can't do that\n\nYou: Yeah - I think that for the most part voting is a complete red herring.\n\nYou: I mean - pretty blatantly. I'm not quite sure if this is the *best* point to appeal to him, but whenever anybody brings up voting I just mention that it's more likely they *die* in an accident on the way to the polling booth that their vote has any non-negligible effect.\n\nYou: I'm not as optimistic that there's going to be a tie, I guess.\n\nStranger: But if people want their vote to count, they will vote for representatives that will make it so, duh.\n\nStranger: I just have to get him to say that\n\nStranger: That would be good\n\nYou: Just ask him, are you really willing to trade an hour of your time (or however long) for the chance that a presidential election ends in a tie, and it was your vote that made the difference?\n\nYou: And then watch him listen to you and it really does happen.\n\nYou: That would break his heart.\n\nYou: Haha\n\nStranger: Well, this has been helpful.\n\nStranger: Thanks\n ",

    "snippet" : "For those of you who haven't seen it, [you'll want to watch this for background](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO90sHeK1Uw).\n\nHere are [the emails Adam exchanged with Derrick, the employee in question](http://livefreeordance.com/adam-kokesh-commits-fraud/).\n\nKate Ager had an interesting point to Adam:\n\n&gt;I think this is a lesson to have contracts of this sort in writing, regardless of how trustworthy﻿ the parties seem.\n\n&gt;It seems that a lot of people are picking sides based on who they like more rather than what actually occurred, which is ridiculous. I still like you both.\n\n&gt;In my opinion, Derrick jumped the gun on publishing that video. Regardless, the email exchange makes it clear that $450 was agreed upon, so I think that ought to be fulfilled.\n\nAdam responded thus:\n\n&gt;Good points, except the email exchange was an overly generous offer that I made, not a contractual obligation. I can't engage in behavior that encourages people to take advantage of me. If I were to subtract the damages﻿ of the defamation, he would owe me money, but I'm not even going to bother. Much respect to you, Kate.\n\nHere's Adam's exact words from his email:\n\n&gt;How about I send you a check for $450 and we call it even?\n\nSo here's my question to you: is Adam breaking his contractual obligations by only paying $22.50 to Derrick, and thus violating the non-aggression principle? Is he making a legitimate distinction between contractual obligations and \"offers\"?\n\nEdit: For those particularly interested in this conflict, I recommend listening to the [Ladies in Keene podcast discussion of it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=BMkOLBZ4aaM).  &gt; is Adam breaking his contractual obligations by only paying $22.50 to Derrick, and thus violating the non-aggression principle?\n\nSounds like a question for a free market judge.\n\nFrom my untrained perspective, what stands out to me is that the (currently unpaid) sum of $450 was agreed on by both parties _after_ the work in question was completed. ie. There was no agreement to the effect of \"Do X and I'll pay you $450\". This means there was no fraud as far as I can see. At worst there's a broken promise by Adam. I don't believe that a broken promise necessarily violates the NAP.\n\n(Sounds like both parties are at fault for not being clearer about their expectations beforehand).\n\nInterested in others' opinions on this. &gt;From my untrained perspective, what stands out to me is that the (currently unpaid) sum of $450 was agreed on by both parties after the work in question was completed. ie. There was no agreement to the effect of \"Do X and I'll pay you $450\". This means there was no fraud as far as I can see.\n\nCan you explain your reasoning for why that nullifies the contract? Whether Adam agreed to pay him a certain amount before or after the work was done seems arbitrary- maybe it wouldn't be arbitrary if Adam and Derrick failed to come to a consensus about payment after the work was completed, but both sides still agreed upon a specific amount. Adam still entered into a contractual agreement- i.e. I will pay you $450. The only difference between \"I will pay you $450 for work you are about to do\" or \"I will pay you $450 for the work you did\" is that Derrick has no contractual obligations in the latter agreement because he already gave Adam his labor. &gt; Can you explain your reasoning for why that nullifies the contract?\n\nI don't see a contract. I see a promise, and I don't believe the two are necessarily the same.\n\nIf i say: \"should i give you 1000 EUR?\" And you say: \"Yes sure\", does this communication oblige me to pay you 1000 EUR? I say that it doesn't (even though it might make me a bit of a dick if i lead you to believe I was being sincere). &gt;If i say: \"should i give you 1000 EUR?\" And you say: \"Yes sure\", does this communication oblige me to pay you 1000 EUR? I say that it doesn't.\n\nIf I say \"you still owe me money for those three months of work I did for you\" and you say in writing that you'll pay me a specific amount for that work, and we both agree to it, then I don't see why that's not a contract. The fact that one side has already fulfilled his contractual obligations when the deal is made doesn't mean the other side has no duty to fulfill his contractual obligations after he has agreed. Because the agreement is \"I'll do Y\" and not \"If you do X i'll do Y\", its character is, imo very different to that of a contract, where fraud is possible.\n\n1. Do you agree that \"should i give you 1000 EUR?\" \"Yes sure\", does not oblige me to actually pay you 1000 eur?\n\n2. Is there any reason why a suggestion \"Shall I give you 1000 EUR, _because you did X_?\", once agreed to, should be treated as any more binding than \"Shall I give you 1000 EUR?\" on its own? What you're describing is how the contract lacks [consideration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration) from Derrick, and you are absolutely correct to say that this is not the same as a standard contract. What you're describing is how the contract lacks [consideration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration) from Derrick, and you are absolutely correct to say that this is not the same as a standard contract. Adam is paying for consideration already given. What they had was a contract (preceding the work) for which the price term was not yet negotiated. As soon as they settled the price term (in the emails), that was firm as well.\n\nAdam obviously owes the money. I got the impression that the price term was already negotiated (a fixed rate based on video views). I don't know all the details though so I may be wrong.\n\nIt's also generally unconventional to negotiate the price of services after they are rendered, so I think the burden of proof is on Derrick to show that such an arrangement was made beforehand. Adam didn't deny that such an arrangement was made beforehand, so it's not a point at issue. Interestingly, many companies leave out the price term at the point of negotiation, and courts and arbitrators often have to determine what that term will be. Adam, on the other hand, provided a number as an offer ($450), and Derrick accepted it. Transaction complete - Adam now owes Derrick $450, and if he pays, Derrick cannot claim that he was underpaid for his work. If he doesn't pay, however, he could be liable in court or arbitration for any amount up to the higher number Derrick stated, depending on what the court or arbitrator felt was reasonable.\n\nI think they should take this to judge.me, and publicize what happens for all of us to see. One of judge.me's better-known arbitrators such as Kinsella or Hornberger could preside, and the loser would pay the $300 arbitration fee.

That seems totally arbitrary to me.\n\n1. No, you'd have to respond to the \"yes sure\" with \"okay, I'll give you 1000 EUR\", and only if you're in a sober state of mind and put it in writing. If you do that, then you've entered into a contract.\n\n2. No. &gt;&gt; Because the agreement is not \"If you do X i'll do Y\", its character is, imo very different to that of a contract, where fraud is possible.\n\n&gt; What do you base that on? That seems totally arbitrary to me.\n\nIt's based on the definition of fraud: deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. Which doesn't seem applicable unless the agreement has the quality of \"I'll do X and you'll do Y\".\n\n&gt; No, you'd have to respond to the \"yes sure\" with \"okay, I'll give you 1000 EUR\", and only if you're in a sober state of mind and put it in writing.\n\nOk. I'm not sure. I'm not convinced that an exchange: \"Shall I give you $1000\" \"Yes\" \"Okay I will give you $1000\", should be binding.\n\n(fwiw: As far as I can see Adam didn't explicitly and clearly say/write the equivalent of \"I will give you $450\". Instead he implied it here: \"Or would you like the $450 converted to bitcoins?\") &gt;(fwiw: As far as I can see Adam didn't explicitly and clearly say/write the equivalent of \"I will give you $450\".

Agreeing to pay him a certain amount for services rendered and then paying a tiny fraction of that seems like deception intended to result in financial or personal gain to me. You seem to think that Adam never had the obligation to pay Derrick anything at all, but it's obvious from the email exchange that Adam and Derrick had originally agreed to settle on an amount of payment between the two of them at the end of Derrick's employment. This means, even with your distinction between a contract and a promise, that Adam and Derrick had a contract before the work began- but instead of defining how much money would be paid, the contract left the amount to be agreed upon at the conclusion of Derrick's employment. The two came to an agreement in writing and then Adam walked back on it. So even if you want to characterize the $450 agreement as a promise, it was a promise that Adam's original contract with Derrick obligated him to fulfill. &gt;(fwiw: As far as I can see Adam didn't explicitly and clearly say/write the equivalent of \"I will give you $450\".

Adam is under no obligation to conduct additional negotiations. &gt;From my untrained perspective, what stands out to me is that the (currently unpaid) sum of $450 was agreed on by both parties after the work in question was completed. ie. There was no agreement to the effect of \"Do X and I'll pay you $450\". This means there was no fraud as far as I can see.\n\nCan you explain your reasoning for why that nullifies the contract?

I addressed this:\n\n&gt;Adam and Derrick had originally agreed to settle on an amount of payment between the two of them at the end of Derrick's employment.

Can you source it for me? I don't disbelieve you, I just want to educate myself. It would be so much easier to talk about this if you'd read the emails. This is from Derrick's original email to Adam- it indicates that Adam and Derrick had scheduled days for payments which had not yet been quantified.\n\n&gt;2 things regarding $:\n\n&gt;1) I just checked my Bitcoin wallet and found that I have not yet received the last 2 BTC as payment. (for cohosting / mixing boards). My bitcoin address is at the bottom of this email.\n\n&gt;2) Tomorrow is the 4th of the month. (Month #2 revenue is due). I wrote for approximately 3 months of the show. My payment is calculated after each episode had aired for at least one month. January 4th would be the “maturity date” of episodes between Nov 4 – Dec 4. I accept Paypal, but Bitcoin is preferred. (This leaves Dec. 4-Dec 25th as the last payment which has not yet been delivered. It’s okay with me if you want to combine these.)\n\n&gt;I don’t have the official calculations in front of me, but based on last month’s payment, I’m estimating that the total remaining amount which I am owed from AVTM is approximately 15 bitcoins. Maybe you can confirm if this is accurate or not, and then send me payment. &gt;My payment is calculated after each episode had aired for at least one month. January 4th would be the “maturity date” of episodes between Nov 4 – Dec 4.\n\nThis sounds consistent with the claim that Derrick is paid according to video views. I don't know the details of how they calculate that amount, so I don't know if 22.50 or 450 (or 15 XBC) is the right number. Derrick wasn't paid according to video views; there were two separate calculations for payment, one of which used video views, but Adam agreed to meet Derrick inbetween the two calculations at $450. You should really read the emails. I read the emails. It sounds like 2 XBC + commission is what was agreed to prior to the work. Hourly wage and compensation for housing sounds like something that Derrick added on to the agreement after the fact. The $450 can then be seen as payment for Derrick to stop bothering Adam about rent and hourly wage, rather than payment for Derrrick's services.  &gt;&gt; How about I send you a check for $450 and we call it even?\n\nWhat was the other guys answer to that *offer*? &gt;If $450 is your max, I’ll take it.\n\nEdit: The fact that even this comment got downvoted says a lot. Case closed than.   Clearly offers (which Adam's query clearly represents) are not contractual obligations.  If they were, we'd pretty much never be able to say anything.  There must be some sort of formal agreement, even if it's just Derrick responding in the affirmative and Adam then saying \"Okay, deal then.\"  Just the initial question is not an obligation. &gt;Clearly offers (which Adam's query clearly represents) are not contractual obligations. If they were, we'd pretty much never be able to say anything. There must be some sort of formal agreement, even if it's just Derrick responding in the affirmative and Adam then saying \"Okay, deal then.\"\n\nI'm sorry I didn't include Derrick's response- that's essentially exactly what happened. Ah, well then - the question is then, did Derrick fulfill his half?  Did he agree to the 450, \"call it even\" (which I would take to mean ceasing the defamatory activities) and end it there?  Because if Derrick did, then yeah, I'd say Adam owes him the 450 (even if he was hasty in offering it, and shouldn't have).  If Derrick continued the unwanted activities in any way, however, then he certainly didn't \"call it even,\" and nullifies the contract.  If that's not what happened, then I'd say that even though Adam certainly shouldn't have felt obligated to MAKE the offer, once he did, it is what it is. Derrick accepted the deal on January 11, waited a week, tried to contact Adam and could not, and then made a video asking Adam to pay him. Adam decided that the video asking Adam to hurry up and pay him was enough reason for Adam not to pay him the full amount,  because Adam considered himself to have never entered a contract in the first place.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say that the contract should be nullified just because Derrick made a video which Adam deemed defamatory- isn't that a violation of liberty? Imagine if everyone who was owed a debt couldn't say anything about the people who owed them debts in the public sphere, even when the debtor is concerned that his payments are being shirked. Furthermore, even if it was true that defamatory statements should nullify a debt (which I don't believe is true), shouldn't that decision be determined by an unbiased third party? Under normal circumstances, you should be able to say things about your debtors, certainly.  But if part of the agreement is that you DON'T do that, and then you do, you've broken the contract.  So if I say \"I'll give you 20 dollars, on the condition that you don't mention that I owe you 20 dollars until I pay you, whenever that might be,\" then if you DO say anything about it, I don't owe you the 20 dollars any more.  Now, that's a dumb contract to enter into, but that's not what we're discussing.\n\nSo, some of it comes down to what you consider \"call it even\" to mean.  Does \"call it even\" mean no more money is owed?  Or does \"call it even\" mean that you should drop the matter?  If Adam in good faith considered \"call it even\" to mean \"I'll pay you, and you don't take actions against me\" then he's also in good faith to say Derrick broke the contract.\n\nUltimately, this is just an example of the problem with \"informal\" contracts.  Even if the email exchange CAN be considered a contract (and I'm okay with saying that it is), it was certainly an informal one with poorly-defined terms and conditions.  In other words, Adam shouldn't have offered it, and Derrick shouldn't have accepted it without being more careful to define terms.  Very few courts would award Derrick with the money based on the extremely informal terms from the email, especially since they're different from the more formal terms in their original employment agreement. &gt;Under normal circumstances, you should be able to say things about your debtors, certainly. But if part of the agreement is that you DON'T do that, and then you do, you've broken the contract. So if I say \"I'll give you 20 dollars, on the condition that you don't mention that I owe you 20 dollars until I pay you, whenever that might be,\"\n\nI definitely agree with you. I think though since there were no stipulations like this, Adam has to accept the obligation he made- he should have agreed to something similar to what you describe. I also agree that it was a very informal contract, but I still think the terms are pretty clear- Adam agreed to pay $450 to Derrick and didn't describe any circumstances that were nullify that obligation. Adam could claim that the phrase \"call it even\" IS such a stipulation.  Since there's no consensus on the exact definition of \"call it even,\" that certainly calls into question Derrick's responsibilities re: the contract.\n\nI'm not saying that's MY position, just that it COULD be Adam's.  The informality of the contract means that this would almost certainly have to be determined in an arbitrator's court - and my hunch is that an arbitrator would side with Adam. It seems pretty clear from the context of the emails that \"call it even\" just means that Adam is suggesting that neither party will have any obligations to the other after Adam has paid the $450 to Derrick. It seems clear to YOU.  It might not seem clear to Adam.  And if there's a dispute, they take it to a third party - usually a court.  We can debate it all day (and for the record, I actually agree with you), but the language just isn't clear enough to resolve it with anything like a concrete, unassailable decision.  So that means third-party arbitration.  There's really not much more for us specifically to debate. Derrick accepted the deal on January 11, waited a week, tried to contact Adam and could not, and then made a video asking Adam to pay him. Adam decided that the video asking Adam to hurry up and pay him was enough reason for Adam not to pay him the full amount,  because Adam considered himself to have never entered a contract in the first place.\n\nI don't think it's fair to say that the contract should be nullified just because Derrick made a video which Adam deemed defamatory- isn't that a violation of liberty? Imagine if everyone who was owed a debt couldn't say anything about the people who owed them debts in the public sphere, even when the debtor is concerned that his payments are being shirked. Furthermore, even if it was true that defamatory statements should nullify a debt (which I don't believe is true), shouldn't that decision be determined by an unbiased third party? I haven't followed this situation closely, but based on your description, this sound awfully a lot like extortion or blackmail. Clearly offers (which Adam's query clearly represents) are not contractual obligations.  If they were, we'd pretty much never be able to say anything.  There must be some sort of formal agreement, even if it's just Derrick responding in the affirmative and Adam then saying \"Okay, deal then.\"  Just the initial question is not an obligation.    No, but if you wish to take this into account when you consider Adam Kokesh's reputation, who would stop you? I kind of agree with this, but at the same, in my line of work, I make similar deals over email with other companies / agents all the time. I would like to think they would be upheld by an impartial arbiter.\n\n You probably do not have a former contract that has been breeched already when you make those deals.  I think that Kokesh, if what he said in his video is accurate and I am not sure anyone is disputing that, did nothing that violates the NAP.  He did irritate some people with the way he does business, so the appropriate response is to take it into account with his reputation. Is failing to honor an agreement a violation of the NAP? I agree with you, I don't think so. If everything stated is true I think he owes him the money, but I don't see where there was any aggression.  Sounds like they had a previous contract established, which I would assume takes precedence over any informal verbal negotiations that took place:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ZO90sHeK1Uw?t=2m10s &gt;informal verbal negotiations that took place\n\nIt was email (not verbal- if you read my OP you should know this) and it was a new contract to replace the terms of the old one that both parties agreed on. &gt;informal verbal negotiations that took place\n\nIt was email (not verbal- if you read my OP you should know this) and it was a new contract to replace the terms of the old one that both parties agreed on. &gt;It was email (not verbal- if you read my OP you should know this)\n\nI meant verbal in the sense that it was an informal communication, as opposed to a formal establishment of a contract. http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/verbal Are you trying to antagonize me? I'm trying to show you that verbal does not mean the same thing as informal.  Within a context of polycentric or private law *(i.e. case law)*; without a written/signed contract, or clear intent on fraud/deception, there's not a very strong arbitration case based on the above.\n\nHumans will often mistakenly say one thing, and then based on new information, new situations, or new circumstances change their mind.  Further, in the absence of a written and signed contract, it can be unclear as to what is genuinely agreed upon, as well as what is to be given in exchange (consideration).\n\nPerhaps if humans were more perfect, a string *\"you say it, you do it\"* standard might make sense, but considering humans as they are; contract law exists as it is based on a wide variety of experiences and reasons.\n\n---\n\nre: Is it a NAP violation?  Meh, I've dropped \"aggression\" appeals personally; far too much subjectivity involved. &gt;Further, in the absence of a written and signed contract,\n\nIt was written- it was agreed upon via email by both parties.   I think few people would consider that to be a valid contract. However, the bigger issue here is that both parties are now worse off by acting immaturely. Hopefully Derrick has learned that he should try harder to conclude these matters privately, and Adam has learned to be more clear on terms of compensation with contractors. ",

    "snippet" : "I am sure you guys are aware there are a number of leftist anarchist groups that like to pretend being proponents of free markets and that somehow they will lead to socialism disregarding every economic law saying otherwise.\n\nThis is not too different from Marx's labeling of \"Utopian Socialists\".\n\nAnyway, I believe the best way of combating this nonsense is defining our terms.\n\n\"A free market is the free trade of all physical objects and services.\n\nMutalists oppose the free trade of land and rent (sometimes labor).\n\nAnarcho-Socialists oppose free trade in labor(wages), capital, land, rent and law (sometimes money).\n\nAnarcho-communists literally oppose trade\n\n\"...houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished.\"\n\n— Peter Kropotkin, The Conquest of Bread\n\nConclusion, left anarchists cannot be proponents of free markets, or at least completely free markets.\"\n\nThoughts?  Actually, mutualists generally believe that some of the aspects of property rights that many capitalists insist on aren't actually justified by any coherent theory of property, and the specific practices that anyone will include in the category of \"free trade\" is always going to depend on how you understand the nature of the property to be traded. A free market certainly isn't the trade of objects to which you have no rights, in manners which your ownership does not make licit.  this. financial instruments are confusing, so they must be invalid! This is amusing, since the response I'm hearing is: Existing property titles can't be fixed, so they must be valid! I would like to hear how you would deal with existing property titles without resorting to force and becoming a statist. Simply remove social or legal protections for anything which can't be justified according to coherent property norms. Force is currently being used to enforce illegitimate titles. It looks to me like the defenders of *that* are the ones who owe us an explanation.  Regardless of what you think is legitimate in accordance to land, all left anarchists still oppose the free trade in capital and labor(wages).\nAre you telling me people don't have a legitimate title to their body and money?\n\nIf so, you still cannot be a proponent of free markets. Again, you assume that your analysis (if you actually have one) of the practices consistent with legitimate title (something about which we know we have differences, and about which you have so far been willing to cut corners) is the only one consistent with free markets. And that is simply begging the question. \n\nI suspect, once again, that what you call \"free trade in capital and labor\" involves a certain amount of \"freely\" trading other people's stuff, at present with the forced back of the state and presumably in the future with the aid of \"pragmatic\" distribution of property.  I'll ask again.\n\nDo people have a legitimate title to their body and money? Actually, mutualists generally believe that some of the aspects of property rights that many capitalists insist on aren't actually justified by any coherent theory of property, and the specific practices that anyone will include in the category of \"free trade\" is always going to depend on how you understand the nature of the property to be traded. A free market certainly isn't the trade of objects to which you have no rights, in manners which your ownership does not make licit.  If someone countered with something like that.\n\nI would just say,\n\"Whether you like it or not all these things are in private hands today. If you oppose the trade of such objects  and services, you cannot be a proponent of free markets regardless of what you think is \"fair\".\" And it would be fair, I think, to say: \"So you really don't believe in any principled form of private property!\" But, more to the point, you believe that \"free trade\" necessarily involves practices with no logical justification.  I would say, \"So, you really do believe in forcefully taking away already owned property!\"\n\nI would point out that the force required to do that would put them on the level of Lenin with his forced land collectivization that killed millions.\n\nI would then argue from a pragmatic and economic perspective.    Mutualists believe that land is not legitimate property.  As a Georgist I agree with them on this point.  Unfortunately, I find that this shared recognition doesn't get us nearly as close as I initially thought it would. \n\nMutualists make the same leap that all other ansocs make from this recognition.  They believe that since there is no good argument for claiming ownership of land, and capital can only be created by mixing labor with land, there is no legitimate claim on exclusive rights to land *or* capital (\"property\").  The only significant difference between them and other ansocs is that they tolerate particular free-market interactions for consequentialist reasons. First I've heard of Georgist. Besides Wikipedia do you have any good source material? The book, \"[Progress and Poverty](http://www.amazon.com/Progress-Poverty-Industrial-Depressions-Wealth/dp/0911312587)\" by Henry George.\n\nA good [brief summary](http://discoursesonliberty.blogspot.com/2011/10/images-of-freedom-georgist-political.html) of the idea.\n\nA [geolibertarian FAQ](https://sites.google.com/site/justindkeith/home/geolibertarian-faq#landownership)\n\nA fun little [online walkthrough](http://www.henrygeorge.org/rent1.htm) that highlights the \"law of rent\" and why understanding it is important. Mutualists believe that land is not legitimate property.  As a Georgist I agree with them on this point.

Do 'Georgist' have the 'labor theory of value' at the core of their economic philosophy like the 'Mutualists' and every other marxist/communist/socialist ideology? \n\nIf so it's built on a foundation of sand and cannot stand. \n\n &gt;Do 'Georgist' have the 'labor theory of value' at the core of their economic philosophy like the 'Mutualists' and every other marxist/communist/socialist ideology? \n\nNo.  Here is a blurb on George's conception of value:\n\n&gt;On the one hand, we have a Labor Theory of Value. Reasoning logically therefrom, we determine that justice can only be secured by removing the great vitality that society gains from the free market. On the other hand, we have a Subjective Theory of Value, which leads us to a \"best of all possible worlds\" in which our access to the natural opportunities, which all of us need to sustain life, must be purchased from private owners, for the sake of \"freedom\"!\n\n&gt;Value is not inherent, but a function of the buyers' desires. However, private ownership of everything -- whether or not it is a product of human labor -- leads neither to justice nor efficiency. George managed to cut through this dilemma by introducing the concept of \"value from obligation\". George saw that the *amount of value is subjective* -- determined by nothing more than the \"higgling of the market\". However, the source of value is not subjective! It depends on one all-important *objective* quality of a thing: whether it was or was not produced by human labor.\n\n&gt;This distinction means nothing to the individual; land, stocks, money or physical wealth all have the same kind of value to us, as individuals. A political economy that sees the aggregate as nothing more than the sum of all individual transactions and values would, likewise, see no importance in the distinction between value from production and value from obligation.\n\n&gt;Henry George showed that labor is not the source of all value -- but it is the source of some value: the value that comes from production. Furthermore he demonstrated that the amount of value a commodity has is subjective, bearing no relation whatever to that value's source. With this firm theoretical foundation, he could confidently build an economic theory that could reconcile freedom and justice, proving his contention (which he stated in Progress and Poverty) that \"justice is the highest and truest expediency\". \n\nMore [here](http://www.politicaleconomy.org/value.htm).  Can't say the writing is terribly good, but the content is solid.\n\nMore specifically on why he feels it is important to distinguish the source of value:\n\n&gt;Austrian theorists also get caught in a vicious circle when it comes to land. This is not because land value is not subjective, measuring the land's utility to the buyer; indeed it is. However, Austrian theory holds that unrestricted privatization leads to efficient allocation and promotes human freedom. This certainly seems to be true in the case of the products of labor -- but it is clearly untrue in the case of land. Although some still try to justify it, using exotic interpretations of allocative efficiency, the evidence is overwhelming that private collection of land rent leads to economic dysfunction. (Public confiscation of the legitimate products of labor and capital does, too -- but free-market theorists are eager to agree with that.)  &gt; However, the source of value is not subjective! It depends on one all-important objective quality of a thing: whether it was or was not produced by human labor.\n\nThis is were it starts to falls apart. Remove the distinction between 'land' and 'labor' then you might have something.  They are both the same thing economically-speaking. Treating labor as anything different then just another commodity is a mistake and leads to all sorts of bad conclusions.\n\n &gt;Treating labor as anything different then just another commodity is a mistake and leads to all sorts of bad conclusions.\n\nLike what? A example of this is when it is mentioned that different areas of land yield different levels of output. So you have one part of a field that yields 4 bushels, but another part that yields 2. \n\nWell the same thing is true with individuals. Some people's labor is simply has much higher output then other people's labor. This makes their time much more valuable and then this creates more demand for one person over another.  It's not unusual to see situations were one person has the same output as 10 or even 100 other people. It's also not unusual to see one person's labor output yield results that  his compatriots are simply not capable of matching.. period.  This can be due to a number of factors... skill, experience, drive, attitude, innate talent, etc etc.\n\nSo how as a \"Georgist\" reconcile this? \n\nBecause my labor produces output that is much more valuable then another person's labor.. then does that mean that I have some sort of special 'rent'?  Does that mean that other people should have equal access to my 'excess output' as I have?\n\nJust like how land has variable output, so do individuals. You see 'land' and 'labor' really shouldn't be treated any differently from one another.  Capital goods can be substituted for labor, and visa versa.  \n\nIn fact that this is one of the major things you have to decide when you are running a business. You can put tremendous labor into starting your business, or you can hire people. Or you can borrow money and substitute that labor with capital goods purchased from somebody else. Or you can use a combination of investment in capital goods to substantially boost your own labor output or the labor output of employees. How you choose to balance your approach and minimize risk is critical to being able to make the most efficient use of resources you have at your disposal.  Creating any special distinction between 'labor' and 'land' or any other commodity good is misleading at best and will screw up your decision making process.  As many others have already pointed out, socialists will simply counter this argument with something along the lines of \"owning property is illegitimate, and thus you cannot have free trade if the trade is with illegitimate property.\"\n\nWhat is key is to understand the reasons why they say this, and I believe that the main difference between \"socialists\" and \"capitalists\" mostly boils down to the initial assignment of unowned property. While such left anarchists try to claim that property is originally owned by everyone, ancaps tend to claim that that property is originally unowned. I think the main reason for this difference lies in different definitions and/or frameworks for the concept of \"property\".\n\nIn the end, I could really care less on what type of anarchy they advocate for. What gets to me is that many of these people will advocate if not pursue political means to achieve their ends, as well as, in some cases, more extreme violent methods.  ",

    "snippet" : "    I wonder how much money in resources it costs to arrest, detain and process 12,000 people? The fact that the state puts people in prison for tax evasion is completely illogical, even to those who accept the premise that taxation is okay. They're upset that you didn't pay up, so they spend more money to lock you up and keep you from working to have the ability to pay those taxes? Yup, that should do the trick! Obviously, the thought is that the threat of prison will be a deterrent.  Well sure, but since the ultimate goal of taxation is to collect revenue, wouldn't it make more sense to punish with a hefty fine instead? Ultimately all state action has to come down to either killing you or throwing you in a cage. \"You owe a giant fine!\" What if I don't pay? \"Then the fine will be bigger, and every time you refuse, the fine will continue to get bigger ad infinitum!\" Well, if I hadn't paid the first fine, what makes you think I'll pay the second. You see my point. This is a fundamental flaw of statism, that it requires violence to resolve any contentious issues with the state. The ability to use diplomacy, incentives and voluntary actions to resolve conflicts is atrophied when the tool you have to resolve problems is simply to send men with guns to throw people in cages. Well yeah, but I think many people would rather pay the first fine than go to jail.\n\nShit why do I even bother, government does so many other illogical things it's pointless to talk about. It's not illogical from their frame of reference though. Taking the time to use sufficient enough force to put someone in a cage and keep them there takes considerable resources. However, *threatening* to put someone into a cage if they don't abide by your sanctions is not only a lot cheaper but can in fact make money: see traffic courts.\n\nSo it would make sense that they would want to minimize the work they have to do as well as avoid fleecing the flock too much, lest the whole thing collapses (even though states always seem to fleece too much to afford the \"solutions\" to the problems they create over time and the \"solutions\" to those \"solutions\" ad infinitum).\n Well sure, but since the ultimate goal of taxation is to collect revenue, wouldn't it make more sense to punish with a hefty fine instead? The ultimate goal of taxation is not to collect revenue. It's to enslave the masses. The fact that the state puts people in prison for tax evasion is completely illogical, even to those who accept the premise that taxation is okay. They're upset that you didn't pay up, so they spend more money to lock you up and keep you from working to have the ability to pay those taxes? Yup, that should do the trick! That could rightly extend to any non-violent crime.  Prison should be saved for those who are a physical threat to others.   I don't think that the italian mafia could reasonably be called \"peaceful\". This article makes a lot of assumptions about the nature of these people and the level of writing appears to be about as good as all the conspiritard articles that appear alongside it on this website. No reasonable person would be persuaded by this propoganda. There are better reasons to be against the state.   Editorialising the headline kinda cheapens the impact of the actual story. I thought his headline matched well. \n\n* headline: 12,000 Peaceful People Arrested In Italy For Not Paying Taxes \n* article: Italy’s financial police said Thursday they had busted close to 12,000 people last year for evading over 56 billion euros ($74 billion) worth of taxes. \n\n* headline: Police Discover Thriving Black Market\n* article: The fact that there are so many people working in the so-called black and gray markets is the silver lining in this story \"Peaceful\" and \"thriving\" are assumptions, we don't know the nature of the people arrested nor the economy of the black market. Police didn't \"discover\" anything.\n\nI can't tweet/share stuff like this, it's obvious propaganda and demeaning to the intelligence of the people I'd like to have read it. Such editorialising is for PrisonPlanet-level blogging. &gt; \"Peaceful\" and \"thriving\" are assumptions\n\nI can understand your point about the use of descriptive adjectives. One persons \"pretty\" woman isn't the same as another persons. I don't quite understand the rest of your argument though.\n\n&gt; we don't know the nature of the people arrested nor the economy of the black market\n\nIt says in the article that it was \"56 billion euros ($74 billion) worth of taxes\", which translates to double or triple that amount in actual revenue. \n\nUnless by \"nature\" you mean that the people were bad for selling drugs or dealing in prostitution? If thats your point, then I vehemently disagree. it doesn't matter what government victimless crime law they were breaking, it only matters that it was voluntary. \n\n&gt;  it's obvious propaganda\n\nI honestly don't see this as propaganda. Who are they supposedly trying to promote if this was meant to influence us? The only thing I can guess is that you feel it's anti-government and therefore unpatriotic to challenge the government. You're in the wrong subreddit if you think we will shed a tear for the state.\n\n&gt; Such editorialising is for PrisonPlanet-level blogging.\n\nwell as long as it's better than huffington post, thats good enough for me. It isn't better than HuffPo. Huffpo doesn't editorialise THAT poorly, it at least assumes a facade of professionalism.\n\nAs for the rest of the stuff you wrote, c'mon man, we're all voluntaryists here. It should be obvious I'm not a statist, I just want a higher standard of blogging. Emotive, manipulative propaganda like this only serves to appease the ancap circlejerk while alienating potential concerts. The headline should be \"Italian government arrests 12k a year for non-violent tax violations\" or something equally factual, without all the pandering. We can't expect other people to take this stuff seriously (and it is bloody serious) if we share crap that's written like a PrisonPlanet diatribe. Any intelligent person is gonna be turned away by the headline. &gt; The headline should be: \n\n* Italian government arrests 12k a year for non-violent tax violations\n* 12,000 Peaceful People Arrested In Italy For Not Paying Taxes \n\nI'm honestly not seeing the difference. \"Peaceful\" is assumed and irrelevant, as previously stated, plus the other problems with the rest of the headline that I pointed out. The whole article reads the same way: the occasional fact and statistic surrounded by emotive rhetoric.\n\nIt's this sorta shit that makes us look like fringe loonies. This is how tinfoil hat people blog, not legitimate philosophical movements.\n\nPeople in this community write like this all the goddamn time and it's a damn shame. The fact that other Ancaps don't seem to recognise this type of behavior is particularly bothersome. &gt; The whole article reads the same way\n\nSo you don't really have a problem with the headline, so much as the whole article. Judging from your initial comment I though you had a problem with the OP \"editorializing\" the headline. Now you're just complaining about the article.\n\n&gt; surrounded by emotive rhetoric.\n\nkinda why I mentioned HuffintonPost. That website is worse IMO. They spin everything in favor of Obama and the Democrats.\n\n&gt; This is how tinfoil hat people blog, not legitimate philosophical movements.\n\nThe facts are indisputable. It seems all you're saying is that you don't want your statists friends to reject you. \n\n&gt; The fact that other Ancaps don't seem to recognise this type of behavior is particularly bothersome.\n\nthats why you struck me as a statist yourself. You seem more worried about the approach we take than the underlying facts. I wonder if you're equally as critical of HuntingtonPost and the crowd that frequents that place? Face it, no matter how much you curry their favor, their still a culture based on violence. We can nothing from a statists approval.\n\n &gt; You seem more worried about the approach we take than the underlying facts.\n\nYes, I am more interested in convincing statists to challenge their preconceptions and become anarchists than I am in perpetuating this dull, anti-intellectual circle-jerk where we just constantly remind each other of just how bad the state is. Is that weird?\n\nHuffingtonPost carries itself like a newspaper, complete with professional writing standards and obvious liberal bias. I don't mind bias in reporting, it's inherent in the job. I mind a lack of professionalism. I mind that our standards as a movement are so low that we reshare stuff like this to the rest of the political spectrum and shame ourselves. Half of the liberty movement online is just bad blogs, fake founding fathers quotes and misused memes. It's shameful. \"Peaceful\" and \"thriving\" are assumptions, we don't know the nature of the people arrested nor the economy of the black market. Police didn't \"discover\" anything.\n\nI can't tweet/share stuff like this, it's obvious propaganda and demeaning to the intelligence of the people I'd like to have read it. Such editorialising is for PrisonPlanet-level blogging. they were arrested for a peaceful \"offense\" that was what was intended by the title of the article :-)\n\nalso...the mainstream media can have an obvious bias in their headlines...why cant we :-P..your basically just pointing out that this article has a different slant than what you would expect in the mainstream\n\nI dont really see a problem with that\n\nthe point of the article was to stress the fact that taxation is theft, and the headline captured that The emotive language and unsubstantiated assumptions in the headline make the ancap blog, and by association the ancap movement, look irrational and amateur. Written that way it could only ever attract people who are already anti-government while alienating and insulting anyone who has yet to question the moral nature of taxation, whom we should be targeting. We can, and should, do better. everyone has their own approach man, some people like to put on a suit and tie and beg for acceptance from the mainstream...other people just want to do what they want to do and say what they want to say ...those people have blogs too, and they also read them :-P\n\nalso, perhaps it was targeting the prisonplanet crowd to pull them out of minarchism...might be a better target audience than voters lol thats not to say that targeting voters isnt valuable but just because it wasn't for your target audience or the target audience that are attempting to appeal to, doesn't mean that there aren't other audiences out there who are just as valuable to open up a dialogue with That's all true mate, and I wouldn't challenge anyone's right to be a shitty blogger, I'm just questioning whether we should be supporting stuff like this.\n\nAs an ex-PrisonPlanet reader who was pulled out of minarchism I appreciate where you're coming from, but it was coherent and reasonable arguments from Stefan Molyneux that pulled me out, not obviously deceptive headlines.\n\nI love your username. is the \"peaceful people\" the part that you take issue with as being deceptive?\n\nbecause perhaps that was a poor choice of wording..but i dont know if that would equate to shitty blogging\n\nlike you said \"12,000 people arrested for nonviolent tax related crimes\"\n\nor something to that effect would have probobly been better\n\nhowever i dont think that calling people peaceful is deceptive\n\nit just can be interpreted various ways\n\nit can be either interpreted as\n\nthese people are peaceful 24/7\n\nor it can be interpreted as\n\nthese people were thrown in cages for peaceful actions\n\ni came from the prison planet path as well..obviously still very connected to that path in alot of ways\n\nbut i have no interest in dressing up or polishing myself for the statists lol\n\nthats my approach... i respect other approaches..but that happens to be mine :-)\n\noverall in hindsight..i totally agree the title could have been worded better...i liked the title you provided\n\nbut i stand by the fact that it wasn't disingenuous \n\nim the author of the article by the way... and i appreciate the constructive criticism :-) &gt; im the author of the article by the way... and i appreciate the constructive criticism :-)\n\nYeah, I suspected that might be the case. I hope I haven't said anything too personal about your writing.\n\nI'm very sensitive to feeling like I'm being manipulated. All broadcast media attempts to manipulate the viewer, but the mainstream media has an established language which at least attempts to cloak the manipulation. Political bloggers, for the most part, haven't mastered the nuance of mainstream political writing. It's personally frustrating to me to see \"peaceful people\" and \"thriving black market\" and know that I'm having the objective information of the story editorialised in a way that panders directly to my existing prejudices. \n\nI'd never expect any of my non-ancap friends to read the article based on the headline, and they're precisely the kind of people who *should* be reading about this stuff.  A thriving black market in Italy? REALLY??? I once went to Italy and chartered a sailboat. Just about every harbor we went to, a man would come out in a dinghy and say: \"you should pay us x euros or else something might happen to your dinghy.\" Sounds a lot like taxation. Pay us and we'll provide you with a moderate protection service (mostly from ourselves). Sounds like the fucking mafia, and you don't want to play with that. I've never met a pizzo in my life and I hope I never will. That's the point. The government is an elaborate mafia... elaborate? Haha no.",

    "snippet" : "  I'm starting to think this sort of thinking is simply due to a lack of capacity for moral reasoning - a lack of ability to consider what should be. This guy says that he can adapt to any form of government, and that he's content in the status quo. I think that's indicative that he does not have any ideas about what should be; instead he adapts his ideas of what should be to fit the status quo, rather than the other way around.\n\nHe does occasionally make some moral claims, but it seems more like a game to him than something that should be used to actually guide his actions. Morality to him seems like an esoteric thought experiment, and nothing more. We're adaptable creatures, ain't we? In Antifragile, Taleb talks about the idea of someone fitting their morality to their profession, rather than fitting their profession to their morality. In the former case, you can be pretty sure that the person only has selfish desires and probably doesn't have enough integrity to be trusted. In the latter case, you can put enormous trust in the person since you know their beliefs dictate how they interact with their environment, rather than the other way around, and a change in political or economic climate isn't going to make them suddenly change their mind.\n\nI think we're seeing a bit of that dichotomy at play here.  &gt;I don't believe you're justified in your unhappiness\n\nListen, you should probably get this guy's permission to feel unhappy. You wouldn't want to have any unjustified feelings, would you?  I think you gave him too much leeway when he claimed that you owe the state money. Unsolicited services cannot possibly be a justification for taking money, lest we end up with absurd implications.\n\nI could put a pistol on my hip and take a walk around my neighborhood. I then claim that I've been offering protection services for people. I could claim that I'm protecting not just my neighborhood, but also all surrounding areas, since patrolling my neighborhood could potentially prevent one of my neighbors from traveling across the world and committing a crime.\n\nNow I've provided protection services for everyone in the world, and apparently I get to decide how much those services are worth, so I get to decide how much everyone in the world owes to me.\n\n___\nThe only workable model for intersubjective trade is a mutually expressed intent to trade. Passive non-refusal is not enough. Oh, I gave him a lot of leeway throughout the whole thing. I was hoping to catch him in the larger loop of circular logic rather than getting sidetracked with important but less convincing arguments. My goal was to actually convince him. Can't win them all. I think you were sidetracked a bit once you conceded that you owe for unsolicited services. At that point, the service provider can just not give you any means of opting out, and you've already conceded the grounds you need to argue against it.\n\nGranted, I don't think this guy was ever ready to change his mind. His morality is the status quo, so he's not going to listen to arguments about how to change the status quo. ",

(There's a dick joke in there somewhere) Now onto the topic:\n\nAssuming we still have the internet and mass communications, there appears to be a huge lurking problem of information. \n\n1. Reliability of identity - If someone commits an act causing them to be excluded from society, what's to stop them from simply changing appearance or their name and continuing their bad acts? \n\n2. Libel - Defamation - If I am a business owner selling bottled water, what's to stop me from going online and spreading misinformation about my competitors? This could lead to an economy of slander where the economic \"winners\" are those best able to lie. I forgot which AnCap thinker it was, but it seems libel is not a breaking of the NAP.\n\n3. The anonymity of the Internet - I think we can all agree that its absurdly easy to manipulate, hide, or hack your way to just about anything online. This, to me, seems to add significant weight to #2 being a legitimate problem even if libel is considered an a violation of NAP.\n\nAnyway those are some things I wanted to discuss. Let's hear some thoughts :)  None of these things are really fixed by existence of government.  I like the qualifier \"really\". \n\nFact is, governments can and do have ways of mitigating these problems. I'm here to ask how these circles can be squared in an ancap society.  As someone else pointed out, your reputation depends on how you have transacted in the past.  A fresh identity would have no previous transactions which would result in a low level of trust.  But we really need to look to technology for solutions.

You can verify my identity, which no one can forge without my private key.  You also have facial recognition algorithms that can establish identity... and google glasses are in prototype form which will eventually identify the person with whom you are speaking and relay information about them.  It's not difficult to see a mixture of these technologies used to validate identity.\n\nWith libel, that is a form of fraud.  While you don't own your reputation, those who are paid to independently score your reputation have an incentive to ensure that it is accurate.  If I make a complaint to the BBB, there is a process of investigation and attempts at remediation.  If someone makes a habit of false accusations, don't you think that those who manage reputation will use that against the false accuser's reputation?\n\nAnd with regards to the Internet, who cares about anonymity?  If you went on a blog that said using Windex on wounds is the best way to treat them, would you believe them?  What about if you went on WebMD and they said to use poly bacitracin?  WebMD has built a reputation of providing accurate information reviewed by medical professionals, thus is a trusted source by many.  There are independent agencies which rate the security of websites that handle money transactions... there are ratings of websites for customer service.  This has all emerged due to the anonymous nature of the Internet.\n\nWhat has happened on the Internet actually lends credence to questions #1 and #2.

Market solutions spontaneously occur where they previously didn't exist based upon a perceived demand.  Isn't that amazing and awesome? &gt; If I make a complaint to the BBB, there is a process of investigation and attempts at remediation. \n\nNo there isn't. The BBB just extorts companies. &gt; If I make a complaint to the BBB, there is a process of investigation and attempts at remediation. \n\nNo there isn't. The BBB just extorts companies. If the BBB does extort businesses, wouldn't companies want to create a better organization if there were no other protection? As someone else pointed out, your reputation depends on how you have transacted in the past.  A fresh identity would have no previous transactions which would result in a low level of trust.  But we really need to look to technology for solutions.  As we're not in the business of a monopoly of ideas, we can't say what will happen, just what might.\n\nSo today if I send you a crypto signed e-mail, you have access to my public key which can be used to verify that my private key signed it.  You can verify my identity, which no one can forge without my private key.  You also have facial recognition algorithms that can establish identity... and google glasses are in prototype form which will eventually identify the person with whom you are speaking and relay information about them.  It's not difficult to see a mixture of these technologies used to validate identity.\n\nWith libel, that is a form of fraud.  While you don't own your reputation, those who are paid to independently score your reputation have an incentive to ensure that it is accurate.  If I make a complaint to the BBB, there is a process of investigation and attempts at remediation.  If someone makes a habit of false accusations, don't you think that those who manage reputation will use that against the false accuser's reputation?\n\nAnd with regards to the Internet, who cares about anonymity?  If you went on a blog that said using Windex on wounds is the best way to treat them, would you believe them?  What about if you went on WebMD and they said to use poly bacitracin?  WebMD has built a reputation of providing accurate information reviewed by medical professionals, thus is a trusted source by many.

Not from someone, as I think the OP meant, who's determined to foil it.\n\n I like the qualifier \"really\". \n\nFact is, governments can and do have ways of mitigating these problems. I'm here to ask how these circles can be squared in an ancap society.  &gt; Fact is, governments can and do have ways of mitigating these problems.\n\nSo do private enterprises. Except they do it better and without the presumption of godlike authority. Nothing about these problems makes a state necessary.\n\nWhat is it about identifying people that requires universal and forced extraction of wealth by a monopoly? Your question leads to a debate on whether state power/force is justified. You think not because you accept the NAP which I don't accept, so my answer would be \"maybe\".\n\nThere, I saved us an hour of the same boring debate we could have any day of the week.  Then why bother bringing it up? You're the one who asked the question. I'd ask why you brought it up but I don't care. I'm not the OP here. You took the trouble to write a post posing a question.\n\nI tried to point out that you're making too many assumptions in your original question. Then you get bored?\n\nIf the answer sounds like \"the same boring debate\" maybe you weren't interested in a discussion in the first place. You pointed out the obvious as if it was worth discussing. Pointing out I'm not an anarcho-capitalist is not an argument.   \n\n1.  **Investment:**  It's the reason why someone with a 99.9% rating on ebay won't screw over their 5000th customer.  That said, I don't agree with the \"ostracism ONLY\" approach.\n2.  **Libel:**  I don't make aggression-appeals personally.  Libel is a harmful action to another human, and as such, as an arbitrator, I would reward libel cases.\n3. **Anonymity:** Obviously, if one can't catch a thief, one can't recover their stolen property.  Same is true of libel.  Also, If one is unwilling to attach their reputation to an accusation, those accusations are less likely to have \"weight\" on the mere basis of the accusation.   &gt;  Libel is a harmful action to another human, and as such, as an arbitrator, I would reward libel cases.\n\nSeducing someone's girlfriend harms them. Inventing the lightbulb harms candlemakers. Dispelling someone's cherished beliefs with logic harms them. Libel harms the victim. Do any of these harms violate someone's rights? Nope. What?  I mean....  sure if you.... stretch the semantics....   kinda like *\"you're infringing on my liberty to steal your tomatoes.\"* Prohibitions on libel infringe on real liberties. Libel infringes on no liberties. You do not own your reputation - \"reputation\" is a term for the collection of ideas that other people have about you in their minds. Other people own the pieces of your reputation. If I offer information to those people that changes what they think of you, while I have harmed you, I haven't violated your rights. Libel is not just simply an act of speech, it's an act of deception and fraud *(otherwise it's not libel, is it?)*.\n\nedit: from wikipedia....\n\n&gt; *\"In common law jurisdictions, slander refers to a malicious, false, and defamatory spoken statement or report, while libel refers to any other form of communication such as written words or images.\"*\n\nThe wikipedia page seems to imply fraud, though admittedly it's not specific enough.  To be more clear, under my proposed arbitration, libel suits would have to demonstrate some sort of willful fraud. It may be deception (though it may not be - truth can often damage reputations as well), but it's not necessarily fraud, as fraud would be a *particularly specific* offering of a lie to someone in order to induce them to engage in a transfer of title to property. Just as gossip is not properly subsumed under fraud, neither is libel.\n\nLibel is merely the free offer (via publishing) of information into the market. That good, information, may be useful or not, and it can be used for ill. There cannot be liability to the subject of libel, however, because *at no point are his rights ever violated.* Does fraud require a transfer of property?  Does fraud require a lie?\n\nFor example:\n\n* Person-A punches Person-B, to which Person-B responds by hitting Person-A back.\n* Person-A then tells other persons *\"Person-B punched me!  You should stay away from him.\"*\n\nTechnically, Person-B is telling the truth, but is willfully deceiving through omission. Is Person A trying to get other people to bring Person B to justice by apprehending him, etc.? If not, then he has not committed fraud.\n\nYour formulation of \"fraud\" (which you seem to be using as a synonym for \"deception\"/\"lying\") isn't useful, as it bears no relation to rights. The elements of criminal fraud include the stipulation that the deception must be specifically used on a personal basis for financial/personal gain. Thus, posting on my website that I'm \"better than all my competitors\" would simply be a non-actionable lie, even if I'm not better, but if someone asks me whether [specific product of mine] is better than [specific product of my competitors], if I substantially misrepresent the nature of the products in order to make the sale, I have committed fraud. \n&gt; *\"Your formulation of \"fraud\" (which you seem to be using as a synonym for \"deception\"/\"lying\") isn't useful, as it bears no relation to rights.\"*\n\nUseful to....  ?  Based on your abstraction of rights, perhaps it doesn't fit within that framework.  What is your abstraction of rights?\n\n*P.S.  Normally, I might make a more detailed writeup, but I'm trying to not spend too much time away from my programming.* \n\n1.  **Investment:**  It's the reason why someone with a 99.9% rating on ebay won't screw over their 5000th customer.

Is there a basis for this that can be achieved via the NAP? I'm sure if I were an AnCap I would probably agree with you, but it does ultimately seem like that's just an opinion. \n\n3.

When has anonymity stopped misinformation from spreading? ;-)  David Friedman discusses this issue quite extensively in his book *[Future Imperfect](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Future_Imperfect.html)*.  He is taking on the issues where reliability of identity and defamation are even more difficult to deal with, that being transactions that don't happen in the physical world. \n\nFriedman specifically discusses defamation in chapter 2: [Living with Change](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Future_Imperfect/Chapter2.html).  It's about a quarter of the way down or you can ctrl-f \"DEFAMATION ONLINE: A LESS SIMPLE EXAMPLE\"\n\nHe then expounds on some of the issues you bring up in Part Three: [Doing Business Online](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Future_Imperfect/Part_Three.html) chapter 7: [Contracts in Cyberspace](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Future_Imperfect/Chapter7.html)\n\nYou're assuming that a monopoly funded through aggression is more efficient then the free market.  I would disagree with that.  I would also point out that those who are best able to lie already have significant advantages in real life.  Also you're speaking as if completely changing one's identity carries little cost.  Doing just that is still possible under states and does happen, but few dew it.  I would submit that costs would be even greater in societies that relied more heavily on reputation.  \n\nThe example that get's brought up a lot is ebay. If my understanding is correct a better test will be if [Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_%28marketplace%29) if it continues to grow.  \n\nA quote from *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*:\n\n&gt;An earthman expects to find a law, a printed law, for every circumstance.  Even have laws for private matters such as contracts.  Really.  If a man’s word isn’t any good, who would contract with him?  Doesn’t he have reputation?\n\n\n\n Another good response! Thank you! I'll definitely take some time to read through the materials you provided before thumbing up a response.\n\nOne thing I will hit on though is your assumption of my assumptions. I'm here to learn how ancaps would propose dealing with these very real life problems. That's pretty much it. I don't understand the need to constantly point out the obvious fact that I'm not an anarcho-capitalist.  **Market anarchy will not immediately or always solve every issue. It is not a utopian ideal system, although some people here do come close to \"The Market will provide\" mentality that is so frustrating, it is a system that is better than our current model of centralization and forced-service-provider that we have now. Keep this in mind when you read peoples *suggestions* of how a civil society can solve or mitigate these issues.**\n\n1) What is an identity? A state issued id card, a name, a face, a given way of speaking or group association? People do this all of the time and by and large can get away with it. There are a couple of reasons for this; centralization of identity and sheer number of people.\n\nCentralization of identity means that if one identity provider can't make a good, secure form of identification then would be clients can't move to another safer one. This is huge and here is why: if I only have to comply with one standard for my forgeries than its significantly easier to make a living off of fake ids. If I had to learn 6-7 major ones then my job is significantly harder to make a living under.\n\nThe second is much harder to deal with but in reality some people will be able to get away with con artistry and fake ids just because of the sheer number of people in the world and the ease of transport. The only solution to this that is reasonable is to say \"Deal with it and catch the offenders you can.\"\n\nNow one possible solution is something that any blood donor with the American Red Cross, a donor card. This card has your name and some address related info on it as well as your blood type. The only thing you'd have to add to this is a system that takes a little blood, look at blood sugar readers that require very little pain/blood to work, and a database to register the blood with in a credit card like manner.\n\nThe other solution is in the opposite, but equally likely, direction of the above. This would be a focus on community that you see in tribal, not to be confused with primitive, or national anarchism. Communities and cultures work best when everyone can know each other and from there these communities can network together to create a very decentralized database of identity. Who's id you believe is based on who you and your tribe trust.\n\n*For those that say this can't work for whatever reason look at how firms, internally non-market actors, work in a market fashion. Each firm has its own culture, lingo and interior cliques/clans but the best ones have a unifying system that makes them similar across regions.*\n\n2) Just because some things shouldn't be fought with force doesn't mean they shouldn't be fought. NAP is a tool to get people to understand that a State doesn't have the right to tax or imprison anyone. Ancaps will use it as the basis of their legal system amongst themselves but its likely that common law will form in different directions from pure NAPism as it has in ireland, iceland, somalia and pre-statutory england. Basically, just because it doesn't violate the nap doesn't mean it won't be illegal in a more general common law atmosphere.\n\n3) Part of this is crap because you lump too much together. Its easy to manipulate, moderate to hide (Look at Anonymous v. Cheese Pizza darknets) and very difficult to hack a well built system. Now remember nothing is perfect and we as market anarchists aren't advocating a utopian system, simply a better one. But all new forms of communication, especially decentralized ones, have their issues. Can you imagine what people said when paper became economical for the poor to use? \"They will use it to plan revolts and shit! Or do dirty things!\" Paper after all has absolutely no signature inherent to it, unlike the internet, and need not be signed at all. Maybe your writing style can be traced by a crafty person could mitigate that with training as well.\n\nAnd to be entirely honest if you are worried about your info, don't put it online.\n\n**tl;dr There are solutions out there. Look for them please. Maybe you can even make money offering a solution.** &gt;Market anarchy will not immediately or always solve every issue. It is not a utopian ideal system, although some people here do come close to \"The Market will provide\" mentality that is so frustrating, it is a system that is better than our current model of centralization and forced-service-provider that we have now.\n\nWhile I agree with your sentiment, you also have to recognize that ideal solutions generally don't exist.  Every individual has an idea of what is ideal for them, and as such a monopoly on solutions nearly guarantees that the individual is left out.  What the market provides is a mechanism to allow individual solutions where prices are likely to be affordable where that solution meets the needs of the greatest individuals, but does not preclude other solutions from arising to meet the needs of those in the minority.\n\nWhile I don't think the market will solve all problems, I do think that we have to recognize that what appears to be a problem to me may be an ideal situation for my neighbor.  So chasing ideal solutions can be a bit of a time sink.   &gt;Reliability of identity - If someone commits an act causing them to be excluded from society, what's to stop them from simply changing appearance or their name and continuing their bad acts? \n\nThis has always and forever been a problem, technology fixes this more and more, if you want to interact with society, you need to have a way of identifying yourself.\n\n&gt;Libel - Defamation - If I am a business owner selling bottled water, what's to stop me from going online and spreading misinformation about my competitors? This could lead to an economy of slander where the economic \"winners\" are those best able to lie. I forgot which AnCap thinker it was, but it seems libel is not a breaking of the NAP.\n\nThat happens anyway...\n\n&gt;The anonymity of the Internet - I think we can all agree that its absurdly easy to manipulate, hide, or hack your way to just about anything online. This, to me, seems to add significant weight to #2 being a legitimate problem even if libel is considered an a violation of NAP.\n\nWhich we already have, your third question is really a run on point of number two unless I'm missing something.\n\n\nAncapism isn't utopia, it's just that sacrificing 30 to 40 percent of our GDP doesn't seem like a sane way to deal with whatever problems we have.\n\nSure, libel is a problem and we will have to find out ways of defending against that, but I don't see that as damaging, especially since we already have situations you criticize.\n\nI hope others have more ideas that address your issues. #3 is its own stand alone topic but can be an extension of both 1 and 2.

It's not going to convince everyone, but it will convince some people while demonstrating that the others are your enemy. They are not 'the enemy' they are fellow victims of organized crime. Can't they be both, if they support that organized crime? Well, for starters to be an enemy usually you have to be aware that there are sides and that you are on one of them.

I felt it was more or less intelligent (though wrong) until that last bit where it completely contradicted its entire premise by suddenly throwing a leftist conception of property at the reader and treating it as Universally valid, which it had just claimed was in and of itself invalid and a completely misguided way of viewing property relations.\n\nWhoever wrote this is basically just a Socialist of some bent, trying to justify taxes by \"ethics are RELATIVE MAAAAAAN\" and then ends it by saying \"except my ethics, they're absolute in some sense\". &gt;I felt it was more or less intelligent\n\nReally? I had to read some of those sentences several times to eek out their intended meaning. If I wasn't somewhat familiar with the argument the guy was trying to make, I don't think I could have ever understood this sentence:\n\n&gt; The income tax does not represent redistribution, since this takes for granted some different initial distribution of rightful holdings. \n\n \n\n That sentence seems pretty comprehensible to me? See now you have me doubting my own grammar. \n\nTo me the sentence doesn't seem clear at all. To me it reads like the word \"This\" could be referring to \"Income Tax\" or to \"[the idea of] redistribution.\"\n\nIf I was writing this I would have split it up into two sentences.\n\n        If taxes are meant to be a redistribution of wealth...then why do the poor have to pay taxes and receive very little in return? That just comes down to an argument of tax policy. Taking the USA as the example, the US tax system isn't meant to be redistributive. The mere existence of progressive taxation does not imply intent of wealth redistribution. funny you mention the USA, the USA has the most progressive and probably most redistributive tax system in the first world. This is only true if you look only at nominal tax rates and ignore where the money goes. \n\nI thought we were smarter than that.\n\nEdit: Also, to keep in the spirit of pointing out wiggle words, \"probably\"?  based upon my casual observations of how other states redirect the wealth that they have stolen, a bit of a complex system, where I feel I can make an educated, but nowhere near definitive judgement. unlike tax rates, which it is pretty clear how much more progressive the USA is than other states.\n\nhere's a pretty good explanation of how it is is Sweden. the same applies for many other states.\n\nhttp://www.whyileftsweden.com/?p=175 Unfortunately I don't know enough about Sweden to comment on it. \n\nAs for the US having high progressive tax rates we'll have to agree to disagree. I think they're rather low when talking about income tax rates. And as I said before, progressive indexing doesn't imply redistribution to the poor or even intent to do so. the rates may be low, but it is the most progressive system. this is an undeniable fact. \"disagreeing\" is simply rejecting reality. \"Progressive\" as I've been using it is in reference to progressive indexing of rates. So for you to say tax rates may be low but the US has the most progressive system sounds contradictory.  This is only true if you look only at nominal tax rates and ignore where the money goes. \n\nI thought we were smarter than that.\n\nEdit: Also, to keep in the spirit of pointing out wiggle words, \"probably\"?  That just comes down to an argument of tax policy. Taking the USA as the example, the US tax system isn't meant to be redistributive. The mere existence of progressive taxation does not imply intent of wealth redistribution. &gt; the US tax system isn't meant to be redistributive\n\nBut all taxation is redistributive. You're absolutely right. But intent is a factor, and there are many who don't believe all taxation is redistributive.  Intent doesn't mean anything really. Look at all the horrible liberty-crushing stuff that's happened over the years because of \"good intentions\". Results are what matter. Also, to deny that taxation is redistributive is utterly asinine because that's what's happening. Wealth (in most cases, money) is being distributed from people to other people. There's no real arguing that without willfully denying reality. Now, wealth redistribution in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, as that's how an economy functions. It's that the redistribution is involuntary that's the problem, and I think that's what needs to be stressed to those in favor of government redistribution schemes. Don't say it's theft, rather, let the people you're arguing with come to that conclusion, because like others have said, that's one of those phrases that closes people off to your arguments because they hear it as hyperbole and rhetoric.  That first argument seems to be two arguments wrapped into one: 1) One is that the state can determine at will what constitutes legitimate ownership (e.g. it can decide that any claim to own a house is illegitimate). 2) The other is that the state at some point in the past \"distributed\" ownership rights to people, and can therefore revise that allocation at will (implying that the state really owns everything).\n\nThe second argument is that it is not proven that you own the fruits of your labor. The third I think is clear.\n\nDon't think about this too much. The person the writer is trying to convince is not you but himself. If s/he were really serious about this then s/he would've considered the obvious counter-arguments.    That looks like the product of a certain anime-loving  tripfag on /pol/. Don't bother with their crap, they're marxist. back in my day we had Flower Girl for certain anime-loving tripfags :(            ",

    "snippet" : "Would certain communities agree based on purchased private law that you might need a license for example?  Depends on the communities. Do you rent property there? Then maybe it could be the case. But if it's your own property, it's impossible to force you to specific terms. But if somebody prohibited firearms on their property then obviously it would have to be abided by yes? on their property, they would be within their rights to forbid weapons. they would, however, be liable for any harm that would come to visitors or tenants that could have been mitigated by allowing self-defense on their property. basically, if you're going to ask me to disarm, you'd goddamn well better be able to cover my ass. Why is the owner of the property obligated to protect the visitors? How much protection does he have to provide? Can this \"right\" be waived by the visitors? Why is the owner of the property obligated to protect the visitors? How much protection does he have to provide? Can this \"right\" be waived by the visitors? I have an inherent right to defend myself. if you expect to infringe upon that right you had best be able to do it for me, otherwise you are liable.  In the hypothetical situation we're discussing, there is no \"infringing upon rights,\" because the visitors voluntarily disarmed themselves to comply with the property owner's rules. So who is going to enforce those rules?  In this hypothetical situation, is the property owner going to shoot it out with the dissenting visitor or is he going to call the police? Well, in the society I like to hypothesize about, there wouldn't be any compulsory government, which is all you really need to know. The property owner could defend his property himself, or hire a security staff to defend it, or contract with an insurance company that would employ its own security staff, etc.  Well, if there's no threat of violence to my person if I choose to not disarm, than I would keep my gun and tell you to go screw.  If you are going to hire a security staff and not protect the patrons or visitors, than you would be liable, one way or the other.  If there is no compulsory government, and say, my brother went into your house or business and disarmed and a situation happened and you failed to protect him, I would personally hold you liable and since there's no govt, that means I would probably stake out your house and kill you.  \n\nSo, what's going to happen if I choose to not disarm?  Is the security staff going to shoot it out with me?  \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that you are trying to obtain a monopoly on violence, without offering anything in return, therefore, I personally would either never step foot on your property and if I had to, I would not disarm, so take that for whatever you will. I have an inherent right to defend myself. if you expect to infringe upon that right you had best be able to do it for me, otherwise you are liable.  I have no idea why you are getting downvoted, if I require someone to disarm before entering my property, presumably I, as the property owner therefore now has the monopoly on violence, and hence has an obligation to use that monopoly to protect my guests from harm.  That's simply being a good host.   I don't understand this logic. baddox has it right. disarming to enter my property does not imply any obligation on my part to defend you. you enter at your own risk. you're choices are exactly as baddox stated: disarm and enter, refuse to enter, conceal and enter. you are responsible for the choice you make.\n\n &gt; disarming to enter my property does not imply any obligation on my part to defend you. \n\nRequiring me to disarm before entering your propery does, otherwise why would anyone choose to disarm?  What is the penalty for if I don't disarm?  Why would I negate my ability to defend myself?\n\n&gt; you're choices are exactly as baddox stated: disarm and enter, refuse to enter, conceal and enter. \n\nThere's a fourth choice, openly carry, tell you I refuse to disarm and see what happens next.\n\n&gt; you are responsible for the choice you make.\n\nIndeed.\n\n &gt;Requiring me to disarm before entering your propery does, otherwise why would anyone choose to disarm?\n\nYou would choose to disarm if you preference for entering the property outweighed your preference for being armed. Remember, you have no positive right to enter anyone's property you desire. \n\n&gt;There's a fourth choice, openly carry, tell you I refuse to disarm and see what happens next.\n\nThat's certainly an option, but one that would probably not be successful and would result in escalating what would otherwise be a peaceful encounter. You would be trespassing, a violation of the NAP, and would subject you to retaliatory force which would be justified. \n\nThe bottom line is that you're free to be a raging asshole in a free society. However, once you cross the line and violate the NAP, things may quickly go downhill for you. Regardless, I doubt anyone would be such a complete douchebag and force their way into a situation where they would so clearly be in the wrong just to prove that they're some kind of macho prick. It's a quick way to find yourself quietly buried in the back 40.  on their property, they would be within their rights to forbid weapons. they would, however, be liable for any harm that would come to visitors or tenants that could have been mitigated by allowing self-defense on their property. basically, if you're going to ask me to disarm, you'd goddamn well better be able to cover my ass. &gt; they would, however, be liable for any harm that would come to visitors or tenants that could have been mitigated by allowing self-defense on their property.\n\nI completely disagree with that part. you ask me to surrender my right to defend myself. if harm befalls me while you have disarmed me, to whom does the burden fall? i have made every attempt to defend myself, and *you* have reduced my ability to do so. if anyone is liable, it is you.  If you voluntary surrender your right to defend yourself while on my property, then the burden falls on you. then i suppose your business will wither and die. SORRY BRO. Well, that's my point. We don't need institutionalized violence to take care of these things. If people don't want to temporarily disarm themselves to enter a building, then they won't enter that building. Your proposed solution was to use institutionalized violence to force liability onto the building's owner. my proposed solution was to make the property owner liable for things that happen as a result of his policies. i don't see that as institutionalized violence.  Well, that's my point. We don't need institutionalized violence to take care of these things. If people don't want to temporarily disarm themselves to enter a building, then they won't enter that building. Your proposed solution was to use institutionalized violence to force liability onto the building's owner.

Whoa there, you are attacking a position I neither hold nor even mentioned in my post. You do realise that this is a libertarian subreddit right? I said nothing about about supporting these people through taxation, I'm not a liberal.

Seems pointless to force them to raise their children at the expense of the taxpayers and themselves. I agree, obviously it should be legal to kill your baby.\nI took umbrage with calling what I thought was an interesting article,\"conservative garbage\".\nI feel that there are negative aspects of cultures be they US culture, Christian culture, Black culture, French culture, Muslim culture or lazy culture they should be called out as negative and bad.\nOf course it should be legal to kill your baby, maybe I skimmed it, but I didn't read anything about abortion in the article.\nWhat I read was that there is a widening cultural gap that I find daily evident and quite problematic, I was positing what I feel is a basic libertarian, simple solution.\nGo to a hospital, 90% of those people that need free sick care are there because of an enormous excess of corporately mandated toxic chemical ingestion.\nAnd like the articles discussion of the cultural gap in education I am drawing a parallel to a present day cultural gap in sick care.\nThose of us that eat vegetables and bust our ass in the gym even when we're tired, and those that eat at McDonald's every day, try to sue anyone they possible can and expect someone to give them a pill or magic surgery.

No more reporting to the IRS? Trying to wrap my head around proclaiming the desire for Anarcho-Capitalism vs actually saying you're an Anarcho-Capitalist. It seems reasonable to me to use anarcho-capitalist to express a state of affairs _one would like_ to see arrive. Similarly: I don't think we expect a Separatist to make-believe that his territory is actually politically independent (if it's not yet so), we understand that this label signifies a hoped-for/advocated state of affairs. I hear you, and clearly you're not alone in that position. I don't know, for some reason this just sits funny with me. As if I just finished watching Apollo 13, and getting caught up in the heat of the moment, I rise from my seat and proclaim \"I'm an astronaut\". There's a difference in wanting and actually achieving. \n\nI'm picking, I know. I also don't mean to offend OP or others. But wanting to be an Anarcho-Capitalist while paying taxes seems Liberterian at best. Of course, you could refuse to pay your taxes now, but what title would we use if we're already using Anarco-Capitalist? &gt; But wanting to be an Anarcho-Capitalist while paying taxes seems Liberterian at best.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is a subset of libertarianism, (imo the logical conclusion of libertarian principles).\n\n&gt; Of course, you could refuse to pay your taxes now, but what title would we use if we're already using Anarco-Capitalist?\n\nIf its important to have a title for this, agorist might come close: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism The way the term gets used--to me--seems to emphasise counter-economic _action_, rather than ideological advocacy. I appreciate the back and forth, this question of calling oneself an Anacho-Capitalist in a state driven society has been troubling me for years. I'm an all or nothing kind of guy, so calling myself an Anarcho-Capitalist means I'm living like an Anarcho-Capitalist. In point, I refuse to send money to the state, and will fight, using the non-aggression principle, to protect that position. \n\nI'm not devoted enough in my principles to go to jail over being Anarcho-Capitalist though. I study, and admire Anarcho-Capitalism, but my actions say I'm a Libertarian. I'll act as a Libertarian now, knowing my end goal is one of Anarcho-Capitalism. My view: this makes me a Libertarian who studies Anarcho-Capitalism.\n\nIn the end, these amount to personal differences in labeling. I'd like to know when those proclaiming they're Anarcho-Capitalist decide they had enough with feeding tax revenue to the state. That would get my attention, and certainly change my view.  When I said anarcho-capitalism is a subset of libertarianism I mean that one who considers themselves an anarcho-capitalist (desires the end of the state) is also very probably a libertarian too (one who seeks to maximise liberty). The two terms are not mutually exclusive.\n\nOne who considers themselves a libertarian is not _necessarily_ an advocate of anarcho-capitalism of course. Minarchist libertarians believe that a small state is necessary.\n\n&gt; I'd like to know when those proclaiming they're Anarcho-Capitalist decide they had enough with feeding tax revenue to the state.

They may already be conducting black/grey market transactions wherever possible--using fiat cash, or Bitcoin to do so. &gt; When I said anarcho-capitalism is a subset of libertarianism I mean that one who considers themselves an anarcho-capitalist (desires the end of the state) is also very probably a libertarian too (one who seeks to maximise liberty).

Can you be against the state as an Anarcho-Capitalist, and fund it, at the same time? Seems a bit disingenuous when guys like Irwin Schiff sit in jail. &gt; my focus on taxes, instead of say \"illegal\" market activity, has to do with one directly FEEDING the state.\n\nI think the two are closely connected. eg. If freelancer X chooses to accept Bitcoin for assignments, and opts not to declare those funds as income, he/she is avoiding the funding of the state. The more of person X's market activity is on the black market, the less his activity helps contribute to the maintenance of the state.\n\n&gt; Can you be against the state as an Anarcho-Capitalist, and fund it, at the same time?\n\nI say sure. Just as you can be a slave, opposed the institution of slavery, while accepting food from the 'master' to avoid dying, or doing physical labour for him to avoid being beaten. &gt; I think the two are closely connected. eg.

I'll concede on that one, good job making the point.\n\n&gt; I say sure. Just as you can be a slave, opposed the institution of slavery, while accepting food from the 'master' to avoid dying, or doing physical labour for him to avoid being beaten.\n\nBut does the slave call themself Free? I'd assume no, which lends more to my side of the point. They don't give themself a title of what they want to be, if they did I'd make the same point as before.\n\nYour not a Vegan if you eat meat. Your not a Home Owner if you have a mortgage. Your not an Anarcho-Capitalist if you fund the state. Alright, newbie question. Declaring oneself an Anarcho-Capitalist, does this mean you'll stop paying taxes to the state? No more reporting to the IRS? Trying to wrap my head around proclaiming the desire for Anarcho-Capitalism vs actually saying you're an Anarcho-Capitalist. Alright, newbie question.
