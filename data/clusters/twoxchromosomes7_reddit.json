Let me know if you think I might have better luck elsewhere. \n\nI applied for this job that I'm really dying for (dream job in a dream town) but I don't think my interview went as well as I would have liked because I was so tied with nerves, it was also one of my first interviews. Do you think it's inappropriate to email the employer and ask about the job status? It's been over a week but I keep feeling I need a way to redeem myself. They said they would contact me in a few weeks. What do you think? Any ladies have experience in this situation? Should I email giving a little more information on my skills or is that a no-no? I'm driving myself crazy here!   It's a little late, but probably still okay to send an email.\n\nNext time, and every subsequent interveiw you have, email the person you interviewed with *the day after the interview* with a simple:\n\n\"Hello NAME,\n\nThank you for meeting with me today. I enjoyed learning about the company and am sure I would be a great fit. My XYZ skills will really be an asset to the company, especially on ABC [project or task you'd be doing that was discussed in the interview]. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nNAME\" It's a little late, but probably still okay to send an email.\n\nNext time, and every subsequent interveiw you have, email the person you interviewed with *the day after the interview* with a simple:\n\n\"Hello NAME,\n\nThank you for meeting with me today.

Send an email. It's natural to be curious about the status of your employment - also you might get useful updates such as \"The HR person has been on leave and will return next week, that's when we'll get back to you\".\n\nIn my experience, some people never contact you if you've been rejected, and you wait in anticipation for weeks for nothing. So yeah, I would definitely contact them.\n\nedit: Although, I would NOT send additional information on an email like that. I think that would look unprofessional.

Always wanted to be able to do it, and since I read it's most commonly achieved through g-spot stimulation, I tried that. Alone, with a partner, no matter what happened, it never worked. Since such a small portion of the population can squirt, I assumed I could not, and move on. Today, my boyfriend was eating me out (I was sitting on his face) and when I came, he made a sort of gasping noise. When I asked, he said I had squirted, on his face and neck. Luckily he took it with stride (and actually liked it!). This guy is also the first who has made me cum through penetration alone (another thing I didn't think I could do before him) so maybe it's something about him. ;P\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat makes women squirt? Like I said, I read that g-spot stimulation does it, but I didn't have any. Also, I'd love to her your squirting stories, embarrassing or otherwise. :)   I know nothing about squirting but wanted you to know there is /r/TwoXSex ",

    "snippet" : "I was browsing r/sex today and there was a comment from a guy responding to a post about not using a condom while on the pill. The guy's response was that the boyfriend should track her cycle because there are some days where the girlfriend is the least fertile. Obviously he does not know how the pill works and the fact that a woman has the same fertility every day of the cycle on the pill compared to off.\n\nMy boyfriend, unfortunately, no matter how many times I tell him, still thinks I am more inclined to get pregnant on placebo week than the other days. \n\nI've seen these kinds of instances several times on reddit and it just annoys me. Have any of you seen these types of comments? What do you think should be done and are any of your SO's like this too?  It's not just guys though, most girls who are not on the pill probably don't know exactly how they work either.  In fact, probably many girls who Are on the pill don't know exactly how they work.  The only reason I do is because I want to know what I'm putting in my body and what it's doing to me.  I think the issue would be education for Everyone. It's not just guys though, most girls who are not on the pill probably don't know exactly how they work either.  In fact, probably many girls who Are on the pill don't know exactly how they work.  The only reason I do is because I want to know what I'm putting in my body and what it's doing to me.  I think the issue would be education for Everyone.  IMHO, a year-long sex education class should be *mandatory* in all schools. One that's *not* divided by gender.\n\nBut that's not gonna happen any time soon. :(  As a guy can I ask how exactly we are supposed to know?  When we are very young no one tells us anything about women, as we get older we hear things from friends (but that info is pretty suspect), when we become sexually active many women are not yet comfortable enough with their their own sexuality to discuss things like menstruation and birthcontroll with us seriously.  Even when we ask we are often given the short answers.  As we get older we kind of stop asking because we don't want to look ignorant.  So if you want to know how to fix this then women need to be more open with us because it is not like we have to do a lot of investigating into them because we are not the ones taking them.  \n\nHell most men I know never even got \"the talk' from their parents because we are just assumed to know what we need to know by some sort of magic or something.  So if people wont even talk to use about our own sexual issues what makes you think they will talk to us much about womens sexual issues. Google this shit. Seriously that how I found out 90% of this stuff being a women. If you are concerned visit planned parenthoods website, it's very informative. I'm sorry but there is zero excuse for not knowing how the other genders genitals work. I never got the \"talk\" either but the difference between knowing this stuff and not is 20 minutes on the internet. I actually know a ton of women who don't know half this stuff either and I just refer them to the internet.   Proper education is key, for instance where I currently live it's not easy finding condoms and when you do $17.99 for a 3 pack $21.99 for a 6 pack it's crazy. I just get them online now so much cheaper and easier.\n\nFirst time I had relations with a girl I was dating for awhile used a condom, and she thought I stuck a toy in her. Didn't even know what a condom was.\n\nAlso have talked to guys that think that the pull out method is good for use against making babies and proper protection against STD's, because the only way a guy can get an std is from receiving it from behind and the girl can't get an std if you don't ejaculate inside her. \n\nI used to think health class was a standard class in school, guess not everywhere.

I'd never watched a man strip (even on the internet), but after a few months of being with the sweetest man on earth, I knew I wanted to watch him dance for me. I'd asked him for MONTHS to do it, but he struggled with self esteem and confidence and couldn't bring himself to do it. He sort of tried once, but  broke down a few seconds in, and said he felt too ridiculous and unworthy to do something like that. \n\nBut on this Valentine's Day, well after I'd given up most of my hope that this particular dream would come true, he told me to wait for a minute outside our apartment after we got home from dinner. He blindfolded me, led me into our bedroom, sat me down, removed my blindfold, and proceeded with the most mind-blowingly sexy dance in the history of history, complete with sound-activated strobe lights (from a phone app), which pulsed-- along with his delicious derriere-- to \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\". It was absolutely perfect, obviously well-practiced, and at the end, he shimmied out of his pants to reveal some brand new shmexy briefs, pulled out a bouquet of red roses that I hadn't noticed behind me, and, in his sultriest of poses, leaned his beautiful body over me and said \"Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie\". I. Melted.\n\nIt is one of the most visually vivid memories of my life, and it was such an incredible joy to not only see his hot self shaking his hips, but also knowing that the months of trying to build up his self esteem and letting him know that I really do think he's gorgeous and sexy finally got through to his head. He was so confident the entire time, and it was intoxicatingly sensual. I was overjoyed by the experience. I only wish I'd had a camera so I could see it again.\n\nAny of you had similar experiences, or want to?  I just surreptitiously linked my boyfriend to this. Didn't say anything, just gave him the link and pretended like nothing happened. :P And by surreptitious, she means \"I'm just going to leave this here.\" Gosh, honey, you could just ask :p\nSource: I'm her boyfriend.       That's a really cute story. I'm glad you got to experience it! \n\nPersonally the idea of a man stripping sounds only goofy, not sexy. But maybe that's because I'm more visually attracted to women.

    "snippet" : "  For everyone saying that none of this works and to not even consider doing it - this *IS* what got me out of my sexual assault. \n\nI was raped last year. I knew he had every intention of finishing inside of me, but he suddenly stopped and bolted when I threw up all over myself and the floor. I admit that I didn't do it on purpose, it was just a reflex - but it still worked. He left. \n\nEdit: Now that I'm off of mobile, I'd like to add that I don't think there's anything \"wrong\" with this list. Yes, rape shouldn't happen, and big steps have been taken to teach \"don't rape\" rather than \"don't be raped.\" However, just because we should teach not to rape doesn't mean that we shouldn't also teach what to do *just in case.*  Kidnapping shouldn't happen, but it's extremely common to tell children what to do if a stranger attempts to kidnap them.

I kept trying to push him away and when everyone came back with the pizza, he stopped and I started heaving again. He said, \"Oh, I guess if she's pushing me away I should stop, huh?\"\n\nSilence. From the entire room. They put him in a different room for awhile and someone else took care of me. About an hour later, two different people were trying to convince me of what a great guy he was because he was still sexually attracted to me after all that vomit.

Only nobody showed up to stop it. I stayed with him for four months after that.   I vomited on my rapist... I think it might have made him angrier. \n\nBut looking at the comments, it looks like mine is a rare exception. I don't know how I feel about these tips, but if they work a little, then it seems like a good \"weapon\" because unlike carrying a knife or a gun, your attacker can't turn this weapon against you.  In a sense, though, if it angers the rapist even more, couldn't that actually be \"turning it against you\"? There's no way of knowing how well this can work, and many people on here are saying \"Well what if helps 1 in 100 victims get out?\", on the other hand what if it ends up getting 1 in 100 victims raped AND killed, or raped in a more injurious way? \n\nI don't know, I'm a little torn. Usually fight or flight is not a very conscious process, so telling someone \"try and use your bodily functions to deter an attacker if you can\" seems very counter-intuitive to how I picture a person in shock. Some people lose control of their bodily functions and shit themselves, but the control could also be cut off in the sense that they CAN'T shit themselves even if they tried. \n\nI don't see a problem with giving this last-resort advice. I see a problem with people taking that advice and using it to victim-blame people. \"So you didn't say 'no' and didn't fight back....did you at least try to shit yourself?\" I can imagine a victim being doubly traumatized by having to explain \"No, I didn't shit myself, I was in shock\", \"Yes, I shit myself, but i had no control over it, and it made him angrier.\" \n\n\n I vomited on my rapist...

I don't know how I feel about these tips, but if they work a little, then it seems like a good \"weapon\" because unlike carrying a knife or a gun, your attacker can't turn this weapon against you.

He was, likely. \n\nRapist types overview\nhttp://www1.csbsju.edu/uspp/crimpsych/CPSG-5.htm\n\nPower rapists make up around 90 percent of rapists, and 80 percent or so of the total are the first type listed there, the power reassurance type. Something crass like throwing up is likely to be effective at breaking them out of their delusion that they are having consensual sex. With the other types though, not so much. That's a four in five chance, roughly, that it might work, and a 1 in 5 chance that it might get you killed. That's worse than Russian Roulette, and only the insane play that game, right?\n\nThat's another reason why tips on how to deal with rapists are iffy. And why the FBI's (if not the world's) leading expert in rape won't give any. To paraphrase Hazelwood: \"I don't know these women, what they are capable of, I don't know in what situation they will be, and I don't know who they will be facing, so I cannot give them any advice.\"  \n\nWhat works for one type might turn a rape into a murder with another. And it can be used as a weapon, still. At least one of humiliation and degradation, if that is the rapists goal, not that this type of rapist would be in short supply of that. You're really right, and that's an interesting read too.\n\nIt hurts that thinking back I'm sure there are a number of things I could have done to prevent it. I think a lot of survivors want to pass on things that realised could have helped them after it happened, but all rape situations are unique. There's not one big rule to follow if you are in a situation like this. It doesn't hurt me anymore, but I know what you mean. There might have been things you might have done, and you might change how you do things in the future, but the truth is, something was done to you, not done by you. \n\nI thought a lot about how I could have prevented it, myself. And, you know, changed because of it. And that was not a bad thing. Growth isn't a bad thing. But, really, I can't actually blame myself for what happened. I was young, and I believed people were good, and deserved trust. I was weak, and naive, and open, and it wasn't wrong to be that, or to believe these things. It was wrong to take advantage of me. I think it's important not to blame ourselves for what who we were, or what happened to us, even when we think about prevention, and how best to protect ourselves in the future, because there is a danger that when we take on the blame for what happened completely that we might see our best qualities as faults that need excising. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with trying to extract something of value from the experience, something that might serve as a seed for growth. It turns something meaningless into a stepping stone towards something worthwhile. Or it can. At least that's how I dealt with it, myself.\n\nAnd then maybe I find myself giving advice, now and then. It can happen. And people sometimes gave me advice. A lot of it didn't really do much for me, but I know it comes from the right place. Good people, trying to do good as best they can. And that's really something valuable in its own right, no? :)   My mom used to tell me something similar when I was little, not specifically referring to rape, just general abduction. She said that if someone ever grabbed me, pulled me into their car, etc., that I should piss/shit/vomit as much as humanly possible all over myself and anything in flinging distance. Though, I doubt puke or pee is going to deter a rapist. If anything, it might make them angrier. I tell my girls this. If nothing else, I think it is a distraction that might allow the child to get away. If you are holding a child and they pee/vomit on you, most people's first instinct would be to push the child away. In the case of a possible abduction, that may give the child just enough time to run. I freaking hate having to talk to my kids about this stuff at all, but I would feel even worse if I didn't and something happened that they could have gotten away from. Animals routinely defecate/urinate when captured. It's a valid defense mechanism (even if it's \"gross\"--or especially because it is). Indeed.  I learned this the hard way with a Chinchilla recently.  Apparently they are capable of rearing up on their hind legs and laser-shooting piss with freakish accuracy.\n\nWould not have tried to pet it had I known that ._. Indeed.

It's possibly good advice, in a sense of trying *anything* you can to buy yourself time and try to make your escape. \nI used to work for a special investigation police unit (obviously won't mention any specifics) and I remember a case in which someone actually did this. A woman had been abducted and dragged into woodland. Her attacker forced her to strip naked and give him a blow job. She was so terrified that she defecated; she then grabbed a handful and threw it at the guys face which bought her enough time to run away. She made it to a nearby road and was driven to safety by a passerby. \nI do however agree that this shouldn't be used as an argument that it's up to the woman to defend themselves this way, there's enough victim blame as it is.  Horrible situation but I can't help but smile at imagining at how badass this woman is for taking back control and flinging her poop at her attacker.  Someone close to me used the menstruating defense and it worked. I don't think the list should have been taken down. It might not be pc but I find these kinds of tips helpful.

Me too - I actually thought that peeing on a rapist might be a good backup plan as well. Probably wouldn't work, but to be honest, if I'm being attacked I'm probably going to piss myself whether I want to or not. Someone close to me used the menstruating defense and it worked.

My friend was taught in school to say loudly and clearly \"I am HIV+\". The reasoning was that if he didn't stop, he would at least wear a condom. If he said \"Me too\" then you could try to get on anti-retrovirals asap. I'm still pissed that nobody taught us retrovirals were a thing in sex ed.

That's just kind of bizarre to me that this would deter something trying to rape a woman. Great info though, thanks  Honestly, what is the problem?

Imagine a list of \"last-resort\" tips for someone to avoid mugging included such advice. \"Try peeing or vomiting on your wallet.\" \"Tell them that you're wanted by the cops, and trying to use your ID or credit cards will just get them arrested.\"\n\nHave you ever seen anything like that?

Credit cards can be cancelled. Those things are not worth your life. But rape is one of the worst things you can do to someone. Desperate times call for desperate measures. \n\nOf course people should be taught not to rape instead of teaching people not to get raped, but most of the world isn't there yet and rape is still a regularly occurring thing. Most rapists don't give a shit about how many times or ways you say \"No!\" or \"Stop it!\" or you telling them that what they are about to do is wrong. So until rape stops being a regularly occurring crime (and even if becomes a rare crime), you have to learn to protect yourself. &gt; Maybe it is because I see mugging as a minor crime. Money (in most cases) is just money. Credit cards can be cancelled. Those things are not worth your life. But rape is one of the worst things you can do to someone. Desperate times call for desperate measures. \n\nThink about that, though. Is it better to survive rape or to die? I mean, there really *are* people (I think mostly old white men) who have said that if you're being raped, you should do your best to get killed, because your life isn't worth living anymore. :-/\n\nSome women are raped, and get through the trauma relatively easily, like any other crime. What's different about them? Maybe because having sex taken from you *isn't* really so much worse, to them, than having your person or property violated in another way? Maybe part of the problem is the value we place on sex in the first place.\n\nAnd, while rapists don't stop because you said \"NO! STOP!\" you're far more likely to succeed in getting them arrested and convicted if you screamed your head off and beat against their chest.  I still don't see it as victim blaming.

Are you going to try and fight your attacker, or vomit on them? Or are you mostly going to cooperate and hope that you don't anger them enough to kill you? It's hard to say what you would do in the situation, I know, but if someone *didn't* put up too much of a fight toward their kidnapper, would you think that they wanted to be kidnapped? Or that they didn't care enough to *not* get kidnapped?

We expect different things of every other crime victim.  This is exactly it. I feel like it is victim blaming - giving you a set of new ways to prevent being raped that someone, somewhere, can point to and say \"did you really try hard enough? I mean, you didn't even pee on him, for God's sake.\" I don't see it that way at all. It's just a back up. Of it weld, it works. If it doesn't, that doesn't make it your fault nomatter what  That's fine if you see it that way. Obviously there were lots of people (victims included) who saw it another, more sinister way. I am one of them. I am a victim as well, but did not. Don't make this victims against non-victims; it isn't. I said victims were included in the people who took this the wrong way. You're the one who seems to want to fight about it. If there are some who feel that way, isn't it best to consider that it may have been worded/presented incorrectly?  I don't get why everyone is so upset about this. *Of course* rape shouldn't happen, *of course* we should teach \"don't rape\" instead of \"don't get raped.\" Yet,  this stuff still does happen, so what is so wrong about last resort advice that people may not have thought of before? \n\nIs it because it's demeaning to pee yourself? I don't get why everyone is so upset about this. *Of course* rape shouldn't happen, *of course* we should teach \"don't rape\" instead of \"don't get raped.\" Yet,  this stuff still does happen, so what is so wrong about last resort advice that people may not have thought of before? \n\nIs it because it's demeaning to pee yourself? With things like this, my take is that it is usually not that people are upset about the thing itself, but that it is another example of the larger trend. When it comes to rape 99% of what you see is messaging targeting women saying \"don't get raped,\" and a very tiny amount targeting men dedicated to \"don't rape.\" Personally, I can really only recall those subway ads in Canada as an example targeting men.    For me this just reinforces the \"You didn't do enough to stop him\" feeling I already have. Haha. Shoulda peed on him.

The fact of rape is that it involves two people, both of whom are independent, thoughtful (by which I mean capable of thought) persons. Since that is the case, that means it is possible for the victim (or potential victim) to deter said assault. That's my problem with this whole \"rape culture victim blaming\" pedagogy. It treats rape as an inevitable event, since any attempt to put agency in the victim's hands is treated as shaming or blaming. It's horrid, really.\n\n2. Another emphatic \"no\".

Should women not take self-defense classes if they feel afraid walking home at night, as it puts the onus on them to defend themselves by making them capable and informed?\n\nEdit: Well, that was no fun. A rape victim never did anything wrong, in any fucking situation. The victim holds absolutely no blame for being raped, ever. Any attempt to say they are partly responsible is exactly what rape culture is. Responsibility and fault are not direct synonyms, it's not appropriate to treat them as such. Moreover, I'm not sure what compelled you to post that cookie-cutter argument, as I didn't say or imply otherwise in my post. \n\nTake away someone's responsibility for themselves and you deprive them of all agency. You turn them in to a mere puppet, an object without will or the powers of thought.  You said rape is not a one way street. It is. It is one person getting raped. That's a highly naive and simplistic perspective, I fear.  How is it simplistic? Nobody ever asks to be raped, not even a little tiny bit. It's similar to how nobody ever asks to be murdered, robbed, beaten, et cetera.  That's a highly naive and simplistic perspective, I fear.  1. No it does not.

Actually, the \"I could've done more\" is a common thought from survivors because believing that one had any control over the assault makes them feel less helpless. \n\nPutting any blame or responsibility on the victim is harmful. You wouldn't blame anybody who is the victim of another violent crime (after all, that is what rape is), so why would you a rape survivor?  &gt;Actually, the \"I could've done more\" is a common thought from survivors because believing that one had any control over the assault makes them feel less helpless\n\nI can't fathom what drove you to post this. I didn't deny that, I didn't imply that that wasn't a common belief, nothing in my post necessitates that that statement be made.\n\nAnd I would, actually, in a very narrow set of circumstances. But, as you'll gather from my other reply to your other comment that you're probably reading right now, I consider responsibility to be completely removed from \"fault\" which apparently nobody else does. What I mean tot say is, \"I could've done more\" is a coping mechanism and completely fallacious. \n\nI know that you remove responsibility from fault, but putting either one on a victim is harmful. It is not the responsibility of a victim not be raped. It is not a victim's fault that s/he was raped. Teaching women how not to get raped is a harmful bandaid on a bigger issue that must be addressed.  &gt;What I mean tot say is, \"I could've done more\" is a coping mechanism and completely fallacious.\n\nAh, makes sense in that context.\n\n&gt;I know that you remove responsibility from fault, but putting either one on a victim is harmful.\n\nI would agree. It's not like I'm going to confront these victims and tell them they have some responsibility. But, I'm also not going to remove my beliefs from the reality of this world because I find it pretty and nice.\n\n&gt;It is not the responsibility of a victim not be raped.\n\nI never said it was, you're making a pretty wild assumption instead of asking me what I mean: not a good strategy if you want to hold a civil debate.\n\n&gt;It is not a victim's fault that s/he was raped.\n\nDon't know why you feel compelled to continually repeat this. I'm not arguing it.\n\n&gt;Teaching women how not to get raped is a harmful bandaid on a bigger issue that must be addressed.\n\nSince you decided to phrase it this way, it has no relevance to what this thread is about whatsoever. A list denoting \"last resort\" idea about how to *avoid* and imminent rape is not at all the same as \"teaching women how not to get raped\".\n\nHonestly, this is the most frustrating thing about debating this issue. Inevitably, I spent half my time correcting the other's assumptions about my position. It's almost like those I'm debating willfully aren't hearing my opinion, preferring to put words, statements, and opinions in my mouth. &gt;It's not like I'm going to confront these victims and tell them they have some responsibility. But, I'm also not going to remove my beliefs from the reality of this world because I find it pretty and nice.\n\nUnfortunately, on average one out of every four women are survivors of sexual or physical assault. By evening making a point like this on TwoX, you are essentially telling one quarter of its readers that they are in some way responsible. \n\n&gt;A list denoting \"last resort\" idea about how to avoid and imminent rape is not at all the same as \"teaching women how not to get raped\".\n\nThis list is didactic. It is telling women \"if you are about to be raped, this is what you do\". It may not literally say \"hey ladies, this is how you avoid rape!\" but it is, in essence, teaching women how to avoid being rape in a certain situation.\n\n&gt;Inevitably, I spent half my time correcting the other's assumptions about my position.\n\nWhat is your position? I'm rather confused now. You say that the survivor has a responsibility in what transpired, but is not responsible for not getting raped. \n\nDo you know what the most frustrating thing about debating this issue is, for me? Trying to tackle rape culture, and trying to reason with the way it is so accepted by so many people. I feel that every time I approach this issue, I am explaining to somebody why my assault has nothing to do with my fault or responsibility. I honestly don't know why I keep this up.  Disclaimer: This comment came from a misunderstanding on my part of what creepypaste said above. Though I would like to direct this now (obviously) at anyone who *does* think this is an instance of victim blaming.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea how you get that feeling from this news article, or the list itself. Yes, in an ideal world we would have to provide this sort of information because rape wouldn't exist, but it does and so people should have every advantage to try and stop it. I see nothing \"victim blamey\" about providing sensical (well, mostly sensical) ideas on how to possibly evade an attack. It's not like the publishing of this list means that if you do get raped, it's all of a sudden your fault because, hey, there was a list! \n\nThe only suggestion on the \"last resort\" options that even maybe kind of comes close to victim blaming is number 9 \"Understand that some actions on your part might lead to more harm\" but that's merely a reminder to be situationally aware. Is 9 suggesting that fighting back might lead to greater harm? I've always kind of wondered that myself. Does not fighting back decrease the chances of being seriously physically injured or even killed or do the people who are going to kill already have their mind made up to kill? It seems that the vast majority of rapes don't end up with murder, but I wonder what factors lead up to the ones that do result in murder? Are they usually planning on murdering the victim or is it something often something that just happens in a tussle?  For me this just reinforces the \"You didn't do enough to stop him\" feeling I already have. Haha. Shoulda peed on him. [deleted] Yeah I don't know how I feel about it. I am conflicted. But my hangups are my own, and if it does helps someone, like even one single person, obviously I would never want to restrict that kind of information. For me this just reinforces the \"You didn't do enough to stop him\" feeling I already have. Haha. Shoulda peed on him. For me this just reinforces the \"You didn't do enough to stop him\" feeling I already have. Haha. Shoulda peed on him.  I don't understand the mindset of a rapist, but would the offender even notice urine/vomit?  Would he care?  I'm all for protecting yourself but this seems as absurd as the old \"if you wear over-alls, rapists will snip your straps\" or \"if you wear a ponytail, rapists will grab you by that.\"  It's always easier to tell women to change their behavior than to try to reform perpetrators of rape, but I don't think it's a solution. I suppose in the drunken nonconsent situation it might deter someone who's being stupid but not particularly malicious, but chances are in that situation they're not totally sober either, so who knows. \n\nIn a violent situation, I think it's a crapshoot as to whether it deters a sociopath or not - mostly because it depends on how specific of a situation they're aiming for. It's just really hard to say.  I don't understand the mindset of a rapist, but would the offender even notice urine/vomit?  Would he care?

Yes, there is.\n\nWhen people are mugged, the advice is, \"Cooperate with the attacker. Better to be a few dollars shy and have to cancel all your credit cards than to get killed.\"\n\nSome women get raped; others get raped and murdered. The same rules apply... cooperation is probably safer. Except, when women cooperate with rapists, they often are then unable to get criminal charges filed, and frequently unable to get a conviction even if they do.\n\nWe hold rape victims to different standards than victims of other crimes, and we put women at risk... not just of rape, but of injury and death in trying to stop rape themselves.\n\nThere's also the element of the impact of this type of advice on potential or past rapists. \"Oh, see, I guess she didn't mind THAT much; she didn't pee on me.\" Yes, people will rationalize this way. And they will decide that it's okay to cross a person's boundaries if they don't literally piss on their territory to mark them.

I agree. If someone is sick enough to rape a woman anyway, would they even care if they got a little pee on them? Or would they enjoy the further humiliation they are putting their victim through? Rapists are fucked up, but not all in the same way. The way their mind works isn't always logical. Some rapists are actually extremely uncomfortable around women when they're not able to be violent towards them. It's not a case of being immune to all horrible things - they might be fine with violence and blood but disgusted by urine.\n\nOf course I'm not saying that pee is a rapist repellent, there's just a chance that some rapists might be put off by it. Delusional rapists who believe that their victim is enjoying the rape, for example.  I don't understand the mindset of a rapist, but would the offender even notice urine/vomit?  Would he care?

But shouldn't you try if it has a chance of stopping you from getting raped? I mean, if you are about to get raped and you have access to some overalls, by all means it's worth a shot. My concern is that it might make him more violent, though. I'm not saying, \"Don't fight back\" I'm saying \"Rape is never your fault, whether you fought back or not.\"   I'm not saying, \"Don't fight back\" I'm saying \"Rape is never your fault, whether you fought back or not.\"     Wouldn't a rapist already know that there's a possibility you might have a disease or might be menstruating? Maybe they don't think about that, but it just seems like it's an obvious \"risk.\" As for vomiting/peeing/pooping, I don't think that would deter them. How many rape victims are drunk and probably have at least vomited? Also I don't know that I could pee/poop on will, unless I already really had to go, in which case, I certainly am not going to hold it in! &gt;Also I don't know that I could pee/poop on will, unless I already really had to go, in which case, I certainly am not going to hold it in!\n\nThere was a research study done some years ago... not sure which class I read about it in, but this is going back probably at least 20 years... where they advised the participants to bring a change of clothes, and then put them in a room, served salty snacks and copious drinks, and waited. \n\nFinally, someone asked where the restroom was. \"Oh, there isn't one available,\" the researchers said. \"But it's all right to just pee here. We will clean everything up, and there's a shower right next door.\"\n\nPeople didn't do it. Then they got desperate... and some TRIED. And couldn't.

Caregivers try to recognize and respond to babies' bodily needs and enable them to urinate and defecate in an appropriate place (e.g. a toilet). Caregivers may use diapers (nappies) as a back-up in case of misses some or all of the time, or not at all. \n Ain't nobody got time for that\n\nSeriously, though, parents: would this be manageable?

I was in the ER and I had to pee while hooked up to all sorts of machines.. they stuck a bed pan under me, and left the room for me to do my thing.  Despite feeling like my bladder was going to explode, I had the most difficult time trying to pee.        You know what would be more effective than vomiting or peeing? Pulling a pistol from out your purse.  The reason the college released this was because they've banned concealed weapons on college campos I see. Seems to me like they might want to rethink that policy. I am willing to bet cold hard cash that a population of women with guns will be less raped than a population of women armed with full bladders.  Sure, so we'll have rapists with guns too!\n\nMuch easier than programs reminding men that they're goddamn adults and rape isn't OK I'm pretty sure if rapists find out it has become common for women to carry guns to prevent rape, the only thing it will do is cause the rapes to become more violent. \n\nOr there will be an alarming number of victims who have had their weapon used against them. \n\nYou can carry a gun, but by the time you know you're about to be raped, you're attacker will be too close for you to use it effectively. People don't seem to understand that it's not like a rapist calls out to you and says \"Hey I'm going to rape you\" from afar, which would give you chance to use a gun, but that just doesn't happen. And I doubt anyone would shoot that guy who has been walking behind them for just a little bit too long, without being totally sure he's a rapist, again by which time, it's too late. Or you're going to be drugged, passed out, or drunk.\n\n\nNot to mention, I'm REALLY not ok with rape victims having access to a firearm so soon after such a traumatic expirience. I'd expect a really sad uptic in suicides :( Sure, so we'll have rapists with guns too!\n\nMuch easier than programs reminding men that they're goddamn adults and rape isn't OK Sure, so we'll have rapists with guns too!\n\nMuch easier than programs reminding men that they're goddamn adults and rape isn't OK Sure, so we'll have rapists with guns too!\n\nMuch easier than programs reminding men that they're goddamn adults and rape isn't OK &gt; Sure, so we'll have rapists with guns too!\n\nUh, we already do. You're acting as if rapists aren't armed already... wtf? \n\n&gt; Much easier than programs reminding men that they're goddamn adults and rape isn't OK\n\nDo you genuinely believe that rapists don't know its wrong? And if they didn't know it was wrong, do you genuinely trust a rapist to listen to the message, without any protection or contingency?\n\nAs Al Capone said, you can get much farther with a kind word and a gun, than just a kind word. \n\n You seem to think college campuses are the Wild West, and if we armed the women folk, they could care for the 'stead.\n\nHere's the thing: a large percent of the time, you're going to get raped by someone you tangentally know. There will probably be alchohol involved. \n\nGiving either side access to a legal weapon isn't going to help protect women. &gt; Here's the thing: a large percent of the time, you're going to get raped by someone you tangentally know. \n\nThat is 100% correct. Which means that your potential rapist will probably already know that you are armed, and will know better than to try to rape you.\n\n&gt; Giving either side access to a legal weapon isn't going to help protect women.\n\nOh please, stop talking like an ivory tower intellectual. Women protect themselves from harm with firearms all the goddamn time.  You know what would be more effective than vomiting or peeing? Pulling a pistol from out your purse.  Only if you use it immediately. Otherwise, a bigger, stronger attacker can just pull it out of your hands and use it against you. &gt; Only if you use it immediately. Otherwise, a bigger, stronger attacker can just pull it out of your hands and use it against you.\n\nCriminals actually aren't the bravest of folk. They tend not to press their attack when confronted with a gun.\n\nHaving said that, if they do press their attack, then yes you fire. That is how guns work. And if you don't fire, then yes your attacker can take it from you, no matter what your gender (or theirs) is. \n I'm just trying to imagine what sort of rape you have in mind where the woman is armed, has the time/ability to reach for her gun while being assaulted without the attacker moving to stop her at all, aiming her gun (again, without being stopped), waiting for the attacker to back off and then firing the gun with accuracy.  I totally see that working on someone who REALLY wants to rape you, yeah, it would work like a charm and they wouldn't ignore it at all. Nope. If it prevents 1 rape in 100, isn't it still worthy advice? I would say no because there's better advice. Enlighten me. What sort of last ditch advice would you give someone who's fought and lost and is about to be raped?\n\nI mean, you're saying to not even mention this as a possible tool for defending yourself because there's better advice. If that advice fails, but this advice still prevents some sort of attack, isn't it worth it then?\n\nThe dichotomy here isn't this advice or that advice. Why not both? I don't understand your objection. I love how you set this up so that if anyone who argues with you is going to lose because they look like a horrible person. \n\nNo, the reason is that when you're in a situation like this, the body goes into a fight or flight response mode that forces the body to not pee or poo or vomit. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response#Physiology\n\nBladder relaxation means that pee goes into storage and your stomachs actions get inhibited, I would rather not give advice that goes against how the body handles a fight or conflict. Your whole body slows down so that you could either fight it out or get the fuck out.

Remember, there is no tone on the internet, you might've even been completely cheerful or respectful when you said it, but someone on the other end does not know what your tone is. The way it is phrased seems like you were trying to push someone into a corner to make a fool out of themselves.  It's the way you phrased it.

The way it is phrased seems like you were trying to push someone into a corner to make a fool out of themselves.  I notice that you are not actually supplanting this advice with different advice. Actual advice would be to be aware of your surroundings and to not be afraid to scream or fight if you need to. I notice that a lot of victims freeze up when this happens, either out of fear of being rude or just plain fear. Unfortunately there isn't any real advice one could give that one wouldn't naturally do, and I find giving advice to be extremely condescending regarding this topic because it's as if the people who give it expect the victim to just sit there and take it or they do not consider how terrifying the situation is and then think that the victim didn't fight hard enough when they froze. It's completely understandable if my advice doesn't work for some people, shit's scary and people freeze up over less, however that's very different than giving advice that goes against what your body does out of instinct.

[deleted] While a shitty thing to say, let's not forget the other side of this:\n\nRapists with guns!   hand guns work, too.  If you are allowed to carry them. I am not allowed to do so. On the up side, whoever might rape me is not allowed to carry a weapon, either. And I totally see that I'd prefer to kick the attacker to the join, but if I can't do so (for what reason soever), disgusting him to make him leave me alone seems like a good option to me. hand guns work, too.  A lot of people don't have that option - it's not legal in a lot of countries.  Please don't do this! They actually found that it only deterred less than 10% of rapists. This article only reinforces the belief that woman can't really protect themselves, only try to make themselves more disgusting to deter attackers....ya if someone is going to sexually assault you they really don't care if you've peed on yourself if your pregnant, or on your period.   Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that you're advised to piss yourself instead of shooting an attacker? Oh silly me, I forgot about the concealed weapon I constantly carry, because that's what everyone in America does Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that you're advised to piss yourself instead of shooting an attacker?

    "snippet" : "I've used them to help me sleep for a few cycles now. About half the time they come out just fine, exactly as the pamphlet says they should. The rest of the time it's a huge struggle. It gets stuck against the bone that holds them in, and even when I try to relax the area, I can't pull it out without using a second finger to grip over the top. Except that is painful... since I can't get far enough with my thumb I have to use my pointer finger, which means the rim of the cup cuts into the spot where my fingernail comes out of the skin. I can't hold that position for very long and it STILL takes quite a few tries to get it out. Today, I had to twist it sideways because my finger hurt so much after multiple tries. And no matter what I do, my hand ends up looking like a crime scene.\n\n\nHow come everyone else has like no trouble with this? I just don't understand!  Hook your finger under the plastic cup around the rim and pop it down slowly and when it's halfway out of your hoohah, pinch it. I call it..... the hook and pinch. Make a serious hook with your finger. There is no real easy way to do this, I am a champion blood flinger because of softcups.\n\nI got to the point where I could actually push it out without needing my hands at all and it would flop into the toilet and I could fish it out with a pencil or something so I never have to touch it. \n\nI am disgusting.  Are you using Instead? Those kind of suck. I use a DivaCup, so I can just pinch around the sides, but the Instead SoftCups are so flimsy that it's hard to get a hold of it. Yeah, the disposable kind, since I doubt I would want to clean something like this for re-use.  Just rinsing in the sink between insertions is pretty effective. I soak mine in peroxide overnight after my cycle, and if I'm a good girl and I remember, I boil it for a few minutes before starting a new one. It's a little bit of extra work and ickiness, but I've saved a crazy amount of money and stress.  Sounds like a hassle to me. I'd probably rather just get rid of it and not think about it. I could never get the Softcups to work for me, and the hassle is totally cancelled out by the fact that I never wake up in the middle of the night with period-stuff. Plus not having to worry about whether I have tampons or pads around. Yeah, the disposable kind, since I doubt I would want to clean something like this for re-use.  The reusable ones are made entirely differently, and clean really easily as well. They're a firm silicon and blood just washes right off the smooth surface, whereas the SoftCups are basically cellophane-like. \n\nWith respect to your current problem: Are you trying to use your thumb to hook it? I always just use my index finger if I use SoftCups, because my thumb wouldn't be long enough at all to reach behind my pubic bone and hook on the top to pull it below the bone. No, I've always used my middle finger for its length, heh.  I thought one of your comments sounded like you were using your thumb, but maybe you were gripping it with your middle finger and thumb?  In any case, I always had to hook my finger over the top of (not just behind) the rim to pull the cup out.  Aside from that, I've never had any issues getting them out and don't have any advice to give. :/ \n\nGood luck! Yeah, the disposable kind, since I doubt I would want to clean something like this for re-use. ",

    "title" : "My BF called me a slut and I'd like to vent",
    "snippet" : "Hey guys, so I just needed to get this off my chest as it's been bothering me all day.\n\nFor background, lately I've been feeling pretty low and have had recent arguments with my BF.  Little things have been tetchy with us because we're both experiencing a variety of issues and we're just generally pretty tender.  Things are sour.  The most recent example is we both went to a party last weekend with some close friends and I got really drunk and that pissed him off (he doesn't drink (recovering alcoholic) and I rarely do, I saw this as my opportunity to get blotto in a friendly environment). He got really mad about my drunken behaviour (just typical drunken foolishness, as well his view is that I didn't spend enough time with him that evening, also while we were dancing he spun me, I lost my balance, and I smacked him pretty hard with my head by accident which understandably wasn't a pleasant experience).\n\nLike I said, it's sort of a low point for us right now but we'd been pulling through it and I'd hoped we were through the worst. We've been together for a while now and I don't honestly think our difficulties lately are a reason to call it quits.\n\nAnyways, cut to this morning.  He'd been upset about my weekend antics but like I said, things were slowly getting better. We had our morning sex and then afterwards I was discussing how I'd recently read that semen was a natural anti depressant and maybe that would help. We joke around about maybe that being the origin of the term \"gay\" and whatnot.  \n\nAnyways, I bring up that it's unfortunate that real antidepressants make it difficult for a man to ejaculate or be aroused, and he asked me how I knew so I explained that I dated a guy who was on antidepressants and that it had been frustrating for him.  We've always been very open about our sexual history with each other, but for some reason this mention triggered him to call me a slut for the number of guys that I'd dated.\n\nIt really hurt but I didn't say anything right away.  I was quiet for a bit and he finally asked me what was wrong and I said \"that was a really hurtful thing to say... why would you say that to me\" and he tries to explain that it was a joke and sort of sighs like I'm being way too sensitive and apologizes... but in this \"I'm only apologizing because you're upset, silly woman, not because I'm actually sorry\" kind of way.\n\nI just say it was a really shitty joke and I don't want him to ever make \"jokes\" like that ever again.  He sighs again and said \"well I already apologized, what else do you want me to do? It was a joke.\" I leave it at that.\n\nWe talked about it at lunch later on, but I still got the sense that he didn't really understand why it would make me so upset.  I just don't think it's a word you'd use, even in jest, with someone you respect.  And if he really didn't like to hear about past boyfriends, why not just tell me he's uncomfortable hearing about my past boyfriends?  Also, like I said we've both been kind of sensitive lately and to me it didn't *feel* like a joke, it felt like a directed insult.\n\nI don't even really understand why it would make me so upset.  I'm really highly sexual and it's not something I've been ashamed of in my past. I'm feeling really ragey and also sad about this.  I want to get mad at him but I feel like getting mad justifies his actions in some twisted way. Like I'd only be offended about being called a slut if A) I thought there was something wrong with sexual promiscuity and B) there was some truth to the insult.\n\nSorry for the wall of text guys, I just needed to explain it all to someone and write it all out to wrap my head around how I feel and why this makes me so sad.  Your bf called you a term usually employed as a means to shame women and then applied the silly overemotional woman label. Of course you're upset. I can't say for sure, what with meaning being heavily dependent on body language and facial expression, but to me it seems as if he was still pissed about the weekend and wanted to hurt you, which is a shitty thing to do. He might have been telling himself that its a joke, but... it's a really bad joke. Lacking in originality for one thing. \n\nRe. the weekend. As someone who don't drink as a rule (booze and antidepressant don't mix) It's my experience that drunk people can be incredibly annoying, scatterbrained, nonsensical and completely unaware of it. When coupled with the fact he is dying for a drink, but not allowed to indulge, I can see why he'd be testy. I mean, you head butted him. Unintentionally, sure, but no-one force feed you those drinks. Seeing as you're dating a recovering alcoholic, I think that it's only polite that you consult him before getting blotto in his company. You wouldn't shoot up heroin in front of a recovering junkie, now would you? Do it on your own time. You're lucky. You're not an addict. He is.  \n\nThat being said, it's not fair of him to attack you. Least of all if he's not referencing what's really upsetting him. \n\nMaybe you guys would benefit from counselling, individual (for him) and/or for you guys as a couple? \n\nAlso, if you've not done so already, I'd suggest that you do a spot of research on the subject of alcohol dependency.  \n  Your bf called you a term usually employed as a means to shame women and then applied the silly overemotional woman label.

I'm 9 yrs sober. And I'm never dying for a drink. My husband drinks on occasion. Our house frequently has wine or beer in it.\n\nIt really bothers me when people without the addiction make the assumption that we are dying to drink again. Believe me, I'd be dead if I were drinking again.\n\nThat being said OP: I truly hope you and he talked about drinking when you are out together. In my house, he doesn't sleep with me when he's had a few out at the bar, because I can smell it, and it's gross to me. But he's awesome, and doesn't go out often so it's no problem.  As a person who works in alcohol/drug dependency counseling (group and individual) on a regular basis, let me just say that you are incredibly lucky.  Many people in recovery, even after 9 years, are still dying for a drink.   That's sad. Many of my friends who have been sober for a long time, also are not dying for a drink. I know many people that have time under them, and a foundation who don't struggle.

I want to get mad at him but I feel like getting mad justifies his actions in some twisted way. Like I'd only be offended about being called a slut if A) I thought there was something wrong with sexual promiscuity and B) there was some truth to the insult.\n\nBecause intent matters. He said a \"joke\" that was not a joke, it was a passive-aggressive way of attacking you. (Everyone does this at least at some point in their life. Its not the end of the world.) It may feel like he is judging you or devaluing your past sexual encounters or an important part of your history. \n\nIf something along this behavior pattern happens again, I would bring it up. Otherwise, he may have just gone full-middle-school and not thought before he spoke. (I am still learning how to be okay with people making this kind of mistake -I know its hard - but I know its something I have to learn because I hope others would forgive me my faults.)  I think you handled the whole situation really well. \n\nAnd I understand your feelings right now. Awhile back, when my boyfriend and I first started dating, and were struggling with some things, he would occasionally joke about how I was a slut. He didn't mean it, but I couldn't process it as a joke, because it felt so personal. Do you think that's what happened with you and your boyfriend? \n\nI think that maybe you should try to tell your boyfriend exactly this, what you've written here. Let him know that you've been feeling sad and sensitive because you guys are fighting a bit lately, and maybe explain how you feel about the word \"slut\". \n\nI think it's still okay to be bothered by the word \"slut\" - especially when someone uses it in a pejorative sense. It's historically a slur used to shame people for their actions. I don't think your emotional response to the word is invalid at all, or that it justifies the insult, or suggests that you are ashamed of your history. I've had a really active sexual past (hence my boyfriend's jokes that I mentioned earlier), and I would still be really insulted if someone called me a slut with the intention to shame or insult me for my history. It's just not nice.         There is a name for what he's doing, it's called gaslighting.      It might be your joking use of the word gay and so-forth led him to believe that you wouldn't find offense in the word slut.  If he didn't mean it in any negative way, then it would explain why he failed to see it as insulting.\n\nIf for instance you used the word \"fluter\" instead of slut and he got mad about it.  Then when you tried to explain it didn't mean anything he just got more upset you might understand his problem.\n\nNot to defend it.  I don't really use the word \"slut\" in jest, but then again I don't use the word \"gay\" in jest either.  So if you've taken it as a directed insult despite his protestations to the contrary, does it matter?\n\nIf you *feel* his apologies are insufficient, have you tried to ask him not to use that word around you? As far as I understand, they weren't joking about \"gay\" in a negative connotation... like saying \"that's gay\" to mean \"that's stupid.\" They were just noting how the generally accepted term for homosexuals (\"gay\") also means \"happy\"? \n\n I don't know, last time I checked 'gay' didn't translate to 'semen-eating'      ",

    "title" : "\"Friendzones\"",
    "snippet" : "I'm sure I'm not the first woman to post this here, and I apologize if I seem repetitive, but I am sick of the term \"friendzone\".  I've always had more male friends than women for some reason, probably because of my sense of humor, but I never had a problem having platonic relations with men when I was younger.  I just don't understand why certain men can't seem to grasp the fact that just because women are friendly to them that we are somehow obligated to be sexually attracted to them, and are somewhat demonized when we don't.  I view a friend as a friend, no matter their gender, and if friend of mine has a \"friends with benefits\" situation I am in no place to judge.  I just get angry when certain people automatically assume that because I am of the opposite gender and I have no urge to sleep with them that I'm \"friend zoning\" them and it makes me look like a bad person.  I am able to choose who I am and am not attracted to myself, and I refuse to feel shamed by men who decide that it makes me a bad person.  Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to see if any of you feel the same.  Thanks!  I've never experienced this in real life with any of my personal friends (thank god), but it is getting extremely irritating every time someone on reddit tells me that \"all my guy friends want to sleep with me.\" I say, \"No they don't.\" and they say \"HAHAHA SO NAIVE. yeah they do.\" (Bonus points if they say something like \"oh well then you must be fat/ugly.\") Aright maybe they don't WANT WANT to but maybe they TOTALLY WOULD if the opportunity were to present itself. Every man (average sex drive) I've heard talk about this subject has admitted this.  Yeah, or people on reddit tell me things like this as well.\n\nI do have friends who totally would if the opportunity arose. I also have friends who just would not. Because they are not attracted to me that way. Because the idea does not interest them. Because they are not curious about what it's like to do it with me. \n\nSo for the last freakin time, not every single friend of mine who has a penis wants to or totally would put his dick in me.  Aright maybe they don't WANT WANT to but maybe they TOTALLY WOULD if the opportunity were to present itself. Every man (average sex drive) I've heard talk about this subject has admitted this.  This is such a falsehood. And you get to say \"oh his sex drive must be low\" if any man would disagree with you. Not all straight/bi men are constantly wanting to have sex with every woman they encounter, and continuing to believe this myth will make men think something is **wrong with them** if they don't feel that way. If anything, I would whine that something is wrong with them BECAUSE they feel that way. I am a monogamy fan and I don't like that dudes I love want to sex other women. But I had to come to the truth that my man would have sex with friend x, y, z IF (again, emphasis on IF) I wasn't in the picture or the opportunity were to present itself. It doesn't have to be a bad thing either way.  This is an OPINION that you have. It does not make it a fact. Stop being so ignorant. If you want to believe about all the men you know that they'd sleep with anyone who was willing to, then you go ahead. But I can't *believe* you don't understand how disrespectful that is to men to imply that they have no capacity to discriminate about who they want to have sex with. Idiot. Aright maybe they don't WANT WANT to but maybe they TOTALLY WOULD if the opportunity were to present itself. Every man (average sex drive) I've heard talk about this subject has admitted this.  Not every guy is sexually attracted to every woman. I’m a guy and I have female friends. If they offered up a FWB arrangement; some I would take up on it, some I wouldn’t.\n\nOne thing I have noticed about a lot of other guys though is that women they aren’t attracted to are basically invisible to them. They may genuinely be friends with some women, but never one they wouldn’t want to have sex with because they judge women’s worth overwhelmingly based on their appearance. I think this might skew the results of your little informal survey. Thank you for your input. Doesn't exactly skew my loose, inexact survey of \"most\" guys I've talked to. I see a lot denial around here. Not that you are dishonest, I believe you... But I got a lot of other whiny replies. \n I'm just trying to contribute to the reddit community and offer my life experiences and honest, mature conversations with my male cohorts. This is something I was also in denial of so I took an interest in asking people I knew. A lot of them wouldn't be honest at first. They're afraid to express their sexuality. Then, with the help of another male interviewing them they admitted the truth. Ladies, they wanna fuck you (not 1,000,000 % of them of course, this reply being one of them). I'm not making this up. No one will believe me :( Thank you for your input. Doesn't exactly skew my loose, inexact survey of \"most\" guys I've talked to. I see a lot denial around here.

Maybe, if you talk to a lot of 15-20 year old men who think they understand everything (and are dying to explain that to someone with less experience.) Men might fantasize about their friends or consider sleeping with them, but to say that they all *would* do it is a little unrealistic.\n\nPeople are applying simplified models of their own psychology to everyone else. (Maybe they even asked a friend to confirm! But they didn't ask everybody: and probably only people who'd agree with them on everything else, too.) \n\nThere's plenty of diversity in people's actual behavior. Simplified models of their own psychology? Or just... Fuckin... KNOWING their friends and their friends' friends? And again... The emphasis is on IF the opportunity were to present itself. Also... NOT talking about 15-20. I'm older and I have a few older friends. Of course this isn't 100% of people... But a vast majority. Hey I wish it wasn't true either dude.  &gt;I just don't understand why certain men can't seem to grasp the fact that just because women are friendly to them that we are somehow obligated to be sexually attracted to them\n\nMaybe because i'm from a country other than America, where we have a different cultural meaning for the word, but i have a feeling the 'friendzone' has changed its meaning somehow. At least on reddit/online. To me, it always meant Unrequited love. Ie. You have a friend you are interested in on a level in which you wish to have a physical relationship, but your friend does not feel the same. That's it. Now it seems to mean \"Nice Guys trying to shame women's sexual agency, police their behaviour and ultimately coerce them into having sex with them because they used nice points and expect sex coins to fall out\" and if they don't they are shamed, called bitches etc.  &gt;I just don't understand why certain men can't seem to grasp the fact that just because women are friendly to them that we are somehow obligated to be sexually attracted to them\n\nEvery bloke I know who's been friendzoned has NOT been that way. They have all legitimately thought they were getting signals from the girl to say she was into them and thus that they had a chance. Only to get crushed. Did they blame the girl though? Because using the phrase 'got friend zoned' implies that the girl did it deliberately. No-one *did* anything to these guys. They misread signals and were therefore disappointed. No-one did that to them. So if the girl was just being friendly and they misread it and then behaved like she'd done something to them and referred to themselves as 'friend-zoned' then they are basically doing what the OP described.\n\nEdit: I say this because a LOT of guys do interpret you being friendly with them as being interested.\n\nEdit: spelling Did they blame the girl though?

And unfortunately the only recourse I have is to stop being friendly with people-- smiling, acting interesting in what they're telling me, making relevant conversation back to them, making eye contact.

That is, in my experience, I've never known that to be the implication.  If you say the phrase \"I got friendzoned\" it implies that the *other person DID something TO you*. That the other person \"put you in the friendzone\". You're referring to a situation where the other person had no idea you were interested and was just being friendly to you and YOU misinterpreted their intention. \n\nIf you were to say \"I found myself in the friendzone\" or \"I put myself in the friendzone\" then it has a completely different meaning to saying someone else did something to you. If someone else is just living their life as they would normally and you happen to interpret their behaviour as being interested in you and are wrong, they did not \"friendzone you\", you made a mistake. \n\nDon't you see the underlying implications of this horrible term. The fact that there is a \"friendzone\" that this person who was merely being friendly to you *put you in* begs the question \"What is the other zone that you were in before?\" If this person \"put you in the friendzone\" when you found out they weren't interested in you, where were you before? The obvious answer has to be \"the potential sexual partner zone\". Which also implies that people who use this term approach women with the idea that they are by default in the \"potential sexual partner zone\", and then feel it's some kind of demotion to be \"put in the friendzone\". \n\nIn the past the idea was that if you met someone and you wanted to be in a relationship with them, then you had to woo them, or do something to win them over and convince them to go out with you. (Granted it mostly applied to men back then, but there's no reason it shouldn't be extended to everyone). That you had to find a way to stand out and be interesting and have good stories to tell and things to offer other people. \n\nThis whole friendzone concept turns that on its head and decrees that everyone should by default consider you a potential sexual partner and that if they don't they're actively removing you from that position and taking something from you. Well they're not. You didn't have it to start with. \n\nPeople should be grateful to have people who want to be friends with them, not bitching and moaning at those friends because they don't want to sleep with them. Having friends is really special, my friends are extremely important to me and are a major part of my life, and in my opinion people who'll refer to someone else as having \"friendzoned them\" are not friends with that person, never wanted to be friends with that person, and are now blaming that person for the fact that they were dishonest in the beginning and didn't make it clear that they weren't interested in being friends. \n\nFor the record, I have had friends that I became interested in sexually and then found out they weren't interested. I didn't refer to that situation as \"being friendzoned\". I was embarrassed because I had made a mistake and potentially made an ass of myself. I also still wanted to be friends with those people even though they didn't want to sleep with me, because they were good people who I liked. \n\nYes it's disappointing to have feeling for someone and then find out they don't reciprocate. But it's not their fault, and blaming them for it makes YOU a bad person, not them.   ",

    "snippet" : "I could not be happier about it. \n\nI am under eighteen, have been with my boyfriend for a year, and have heard a chorus of \"underage sex is bad,\" \"unmarried sex is bad,\" and just plain ol' \"sex is bad\" from my peers and from most adults regarding this matter. \n\nHowever, after talking to my mother and my boyfriend about it, I realized I was not frightened at the prospect of \"losing my v-card\" so we did it with condoms on Saturday. And it felt *fantastic*. He was attentive to my needs, he made sure he was going at the right speed, and kept things very relaxed and comfortable. Afterwards, we watched a movie together and he stroked my hair while we cuddled. We've done it twice again since then.\n\nIt did not make me depressed, it did not make my grades tank, it did not make me an irritable and emotional sociopath, but it also did not make me a woman. PIV sex did not change a single thing except the fact that genitals instead of fingers were inserted into me. If I didn't love him before having my \"Sexual Debut\" with him, I wouldn't love him now. But I did love him then, and I do love him now. \n\nNot planning on having sex again until I'm prescribed BC or an IUD (better safe than sorry), but man, I had sex and I loved it. I'm not even a little bit ashamed. \n\nThanks for listening, TwoX. \n\n\n**EDIT:** Oh god, obligatory top post edit. I'd like to thank my vagina and my internet provider. I can't reply to all of you so I just want to say thank you SO much, I am reading every comment and taking everyone's advice. I will be speaking to a doctor this week and making sure I choose something that is right for me. But overall, I am just so happy that I can be part of a breed of women who like sex and aren't afraid to talk about it.\n\n For everyone who lost their virginity in bad circumstances: virginity is and always has been a social construct. Some people consider losing their virginity having oral sex, or having anal sex, or even kissing. As I have just learned firsthand, sex does not define you. *YOU define you.* Experiment, have fun, do what makes you feel good. \"The second half of the play is usually better than the first\". I just happened to get lucky. Love you, TwoX. Stay golden. \n\n  [Hooray!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbtg02hPnD1rtocdj.jpg) I let him wear his chain and his turtle neck sweater, so I guess it was positive for him too.

Also, go you for looking into birth control as well. I reccommend going a pill before getting and IUD just because hormones can be tricky while still in your teens and IUDs are harder to get removed if they turn nasty.\n The IUD is a bigger commitment but the non-hormonal Paragard can be a great, effective alternative to hormones (the pill or Mirena IUD) What's this? I've been having problems with birth control because it either makes me crazy or I have bad periods and I'm allergic to latex.  [Paragard] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragard) I was mainly asking about personal experiences, if anyone has had problems with it.  The only side effect I have experienced was heavy bleeding and a bit of mild cramping in the first few months. I am over half a year in though and it is honestly the best decision I have made birth control wise. I have never felt more in control of my body. Do periods stop eventually?  Not with the Paragard, it actually tends to make periods heavier. The IUD that tends to stop periods is the Mirena, which is the hormonal one. The Mirena attacked my vagina. I hate that thing.

I was mainly asking about personal experiences, if anyone has had problems with it.  I was mainly asking about personal experiences, if anyone has had problems with it.  I have it and I love it. It makes my periods a little heavier and last longer but I can't do hormones at all. I am pretty sexually active and I have had this for a whole year now with only one problem. The only problem was contracting a small infection or irritation after first getting it but it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. My doctor said it was probably just some stray bacteria. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't in a stable relationship because STDs are much more serious with paragaurd and mirena.  I was mainly asking about personal experiences, if anyone has had problems with it.  Since I adore my copper IUD and generally want to shout my love for it from the rooftops, I'll settle for telling you a bit about my experience! To give context, I'm 21 and have had my (copper) IUD for coming up to 18 months now. Most of this is stuff I have posted to TwoX in the past, but like I said.. I'm a big fan and wish everyone knew about it.\n\nAnyways: so far, it's AWESOME.\n\nInsertion: Relatively easy process - similar to a pap smear in terms of how uncomfortable it was for me. That being said, I was prescribed some meds to open my cervix and was also on my period when it was inserted (which made for an easier procedure). The whole appointment took about 10 minutes start to finish, and I felt like I could do cartwheels after! A few hours later I was slightly crampy, but it was wayyyy less intense than I had anticipated- close to regular period cramps (the kind that don't require any painkillers). Please don't let the pain scare you! Of course, it's different for every person, and I understand that I was relatively lucky in the cramping department.\n\nWhy I chose it: I got the copper IUD because there were no hormones involved, there's nothing to have to remember with an IUD, and the cost is super low (generally speaking and also in comparison with the mirena - It only cost me $80, a huge steal when you consider that it'll work for five years.)\n\nHow it is now: I really can't feel it at all. If I reaaally reach up to my cervix , I can feel the strings (which are similar to fishing line and are only a few cm long). None of my partners have been able to feel it during sex either, but I've heard it is an issue for some guys -- a fixable one, though, as the strings can be shortened in a relatively easy process. It made my periods heavier for the first year, and for the first 11 months I spotted (lightly) almost every day between periods. Not fun, but it stopped almost to the day of my \"anniversary\" and my bod went back to pre-IUD menstruation. To me, a year of a little blood was totally worth not worrying and getting to er.. ride bareback, haha. I have heard that it can also make periods crampier for some women, although I haven't experienced any cramping at all since the day it was inserted.\n\nFor more info, feel free to PM me if you'd like. All in all, it was a great decision for me and I encourage anyone to at least give it a try. Just think of all the baby-free sex you could be having!\n\n**tl;dr Pros: Low cost, high effectiveness, convenience, no hormones, makes barebacking a safe option (with tested partners). Cons: insertion discomfort, chance of rejection (around 5%), heavier periods, might have more cramping.** When I hear about interesting birth control methods like IUD's, I get excited and want to try it, but then I remember I have a penis... Haha! One day male birth control'll catch up, just you wait. Well I am actually a trans girl, so at any rate, hormone replacement therapy will render me infertile before long... Haha!

I had a healthy sex life between then and the time I met my husband around 25. I've been monogamous since then because that's what works for us. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex as long as you're honest with your partners.  Yay! I don't understand this whole sentiment that underage or unmarried sex is bad. I lost my virginity at 14, and because my mom had had several frank talks with me, I was prepared and all went well. I'm 19 now, and losing my virginity at \"such a young age\" has had no negative effects on me whatsoever. Yay! I don't understand this whole sentiment that underage or unmarried sex is bad.

Average sexual debut is 14.8.\n\nLocal school district does sex ed at 5th, 8th, and 10th grade.  Can you tell me what ages kids would be at in those grades?

I just have an alarm set on my phone for 11 PM every day of the week. Yeah, I set my alarm too.  But I've got ADHD, so I set alarms for basically everything I do except eating and breathing.  I have alarms reminding myself to drink water. I will seriously only drink my morning coffee and nothing else all day and wonder why I have a raging headache the next morning. \n Yeah, I set my alarm too.

How did you talk to your mother about it?\n\nJust curious  Hi! I said \"I feel like I may lose my virginity soon and I want to make sure I know everything before I go through with it\". She had a talk with me about condoms for the millionth time (thank you, mom!) and told me it was normal for me to be feeling sexually curious and that it wasn't weird for me to want to have sex. She told me she should get me on birth control once I absolutely knew I was going to do it, but if I felt uncomfortable telling her beforehand I could tell her afterwards. \n\nI love my mommy. She is the light of my life and my best friend. I don't know what I would do without her or my dad, I am very lucky to have such understanding parental units :)  That sounds awesome that you could talk to your mother about that. I didn't lose my virginity until last year when I was 22. I was also still living at home and I had my mother tell me that there's a no sex rule and I shouldn't be having it.\n\nNot to mention the fact I've always been a responsible person and I had been dating my first ever boyfriend for over a year when we finally had PIV sex.\n\nWhen they noticed I got myself on birth control I had to lie and say my doctor gave it to me to see about regulating pain. It just baffles me that they expect me to be a virgin at my age. Hi! I said \"I feel like I may lose my virginity soon and I want to make sure I know everything before I go through with it\".

She is the light of my life and my best friend. I don't know what I would do without her or my dad, I am very lucky to have such understanding parental units :)  Hi! I said \"I feel like I may lose my virginity soon and I want to make sure I know everything before I go through with it\".

Do you have any first time insight?  I have been living mostly on my own for almost a decade and married for more than 4 years, and just reading that still makes me involuntarily shudder. \n\nClearly, your parents were more sex-positive than mine :P I suggest being sex positive with your kids. My mom was very sec positive and I can't be any more glad that she did. I feel like it opened me up to talking to her about anything. I'm very very open with her. I even asked her if it's ok for me to try pot.... I'm 21. I shouldn't have to ask, but I did ask and I didn't end up trying it. Hated the smell. But anyway. Please try to be open with your kids if you ever plan on having them! They will thank you later. I have a similar relationship with my mom.  I'm definitely going to take this approach when I have kids of my own. I suggest being sex positive with your kids. My mom was very sec positive and I can't be any more glad that she did.

Hi mom I'm planning on having sex. Do you have any first time insight?  Hi mom I'm planning on having sex. Do you have any first time insight?  Hahaha I remember when I was 16 my mom asked me and my bf if we needed her to buy us condoms. So awkward but now that I think about it she was pretty awesome and trusting of me.                   Congrats!  I'm happy that it was a pleasant experience for you.\n\nI lost mine during my freshman year of college and it was painful.  Sometimes I wonder if it created a psychological blockage that inhibits me from being able to cum via intercourse.  Or I could just be one of those women that doesn't have a prominent g-spot.  Either way, thank god for the clitoris.                     ",

    "title" : "My boyfriend says that for me to potentially perform burlesque = embarrassing and slutty.  Now, my sister and her husband are saying basically the same.  \"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!\"",
    "snippet" : "This whole situation has turned into a bigger mess than I ever anticipated, and to be frank, I need advice.  And this story is LOOOOOONG!\n\nA few weeks ago, I breached the subject with my long-term boyfriend.  He responded with saying, \"You don't really want to do that, do you?\" and \"Pweese don't do burlesque!  For me?\"\n\nUntil 4 days ago, I dropped the subject.  I brought it back up because, without telling him, I learned that a local burlesque troop was auditioning for a stage kitten (stage assistant).  I voiced my interest via e-mail, the main performer asked for some pictures, and I provided.  The pictures I had taken showed some skin but were still tasteful, in my eyes.\n\nI still haven't told my boyfriend or family about this.  All that I got to say to my boyfriend before this situation exploded was, \"I think I'm going to do burlesque.\"\n\nFast forward to today and we've been talking about everything from which burlesque costumes would be acceptable to life plans and career goals.  We scheduled an appointment with a counselor, for tomorrow.  I feel like our relationship is falling apart and that I really might not be the woman for him.\n\nI talked to my sister and her husband for advice, because I value their opinions.  Much to my surprise, they mirrored everything that my boyfriend said as soon as they found out I wanted to strip down to pasties and a G-String.\n\nThey are all basically saying that women who strip are not desirable to men, are practically cheating on their partners by performing, are very taboo, live a dangerous lifestyle.  They say that this could jeopardize my other opportunities in life and relationships.  Apparently, my boyfriend's family are all in agreement, too.\n\nI'm overwhelmed and shocked.  I had always thought that burlesque was socially accepted by now, and I certainly thought that my family and boyfriend were...a little more progressive?\n\nI never thought that I would lie by omission to my boyfriend.  I'm going so far as secretly looking into apartment listings, because I feel like if/when I tell him the whole truth, he'll want me gone.  He's basically said as much.\n\nI'm starting to think that everyone around me is settling into the comfortable idea of getting a secure job, buying a starter home, getting married and having children.  I think that they expect the same of me, but the honest cold truth is that I want pursue my life goals and make them happen.  I happen to think that I'm quite goddamn fabulous and up to my eyes in talent.  And I'll give up a lot of things to achieve my goals.  To them, it's sex work, and for many, sex work is still taboo and suggestive of habits and proclivities that you may or may not have.\n\nI'd err on the side of considering my boyfriend's feelings. I try not to make my partners uncomfortable. HOWEVER, if this is what you really want to do, and you know what it means to *you*, then you're going to have to think about which is more important: Boyfriend or Burlesque?\n\nBut **NO** lies of omission. That would be a dick move. OP: this is rational, sensible, critical advice. Please listen to InfernalWedgie. This situation is my very own infernal wedgie.  I think this is less of an issue of burlesque being socially acceptable and more of an issue with respect in relationships. \n\nFor him, it's obviously not okay to have his girlfriend up onstage in pasties and a g-string. Regardless of how you think he should feel, that's how he feel's and you have no right to tell him he's wrong to feel it. Just as he has no right to tell you how you should feel about it. \n\nIf your relationship with your partner is worth ending over you wanting to dance, then do it! If it's what you really want to do. If not, I'd reconsider how important it is to you. Lying isn't an option if you want a healthy relationship. Is there any sort of compromise you two could make? Could you take classes and preform at home for him instead of on stage for a crowd?  A compromise is very plausible.  My dance studio has been talking about doing an invite-only, private burlesque show.  And he and I can talk about outfits.  But, you know, my parents always told me that as soon as a partner starts telling you what you may and may not wear, that should be a red flag about the dynamics of your relationship.  Is that same idea applicable to this situation? A compromise is very plausible.  My dance studio has been talking about doing an invite-only, private burlesque show.

I'd definitely talk to him as soon as possible though. It is going to be bad enough if he decides he doesn't want to stay together, but if he finds out you went behind his back, that'd probably hurt him. \n\nAre they informed clearly on what burlesque is??   Burlesque isn't mainstream. Just saying. Personally I'd be more concerned if I discovered that a loved one joined that military. \n\nStill, how would you feel if you bf joined the Chippendales and hid it from you, even-thought he knew you'd be upset by it? You're lying to your bf. Not cool. Not cool at all.  I know.  I never thought that I would.  It's so surreal.  I keep oscillating between feeling like a fallible human in her first long-term relationship and a...fucking douche.  I don't want to be a douche.  And as much as I'm not looking forward to it, I know that I'm the only one who can clean up my mess. I know.  I never thought that I would.  It's so surreal.

And as much as I'm not looking forward to it, I know that I'm the only one who can clean up my mess. If you thought he was upset when you were just talking about doing burlesque, just wait until he finds out that you have been doing it anyway and lying about it.  Talking about taking a small issue and turning it into a giant issue. Basically.  I really screwed the pooch on this one.  It's unfortunate, to say the least, that I only understand that in hindsight.   What are your life goals? To be a performing, touring musician with a band and albums.  It's true that burlesque would really only be something for fun.  Music is supremely important to me.  The problem is, once my boyfriend and I started talking really deeply, he didn't like the idea of me traveling and performing music and taking my music as far as I can.  He thinks that I have unrealistic pipe dreams and need to relegate my passions to hobbies.\n\nI guess what really bothered me about this whole thing was that my partner wouldn't back me up on my passions and the things that keep me loving life - whether they be temporary interests or decades-long.  My sister and husband thought that he wasn't backing me up because he thinks that my passions will negatively affect our relationship.  And you know what?  Maybe it will.  Maybe I shouldn't be in a relationship when I'm at work, 9-5, and practicing from 6-12.  Maybe 18-hour days aren't conducive to a relationship.  I don't know!  I'm very confused.

He's basically said as much.\n\nAre you being serious?  \n\nGood on you for sticking to your guns if it's something that means that much to you, but; you need to follow through now.\n\nThat means that you don't get to secretly look for apartment listings while he thinks that everything is peachy-keen.  You don't get to mentally check-out when he hasn't.  That's the hallmark of a coward.  \n\nSo far, you've done well by sticking up for yourself—if indeed potentially losing your boyfriend is worth that.  That's a tough choice to make to be sure of it.  But so far, you've only been ballsy with the things you *wan't* to do.  Now you have to go be just as ballsy with something that you *don't* want to do—sitting your boyfriend down and talking to him.  \n\nTo wit, he needs to hear you say this:\n\n&gt;I'm starting to think that everyone around me is settling into the comfortable idea of getting a secure job, buying a starter home, getting married and having children. I think that they expect the same of me, but the honest cold truth is that I want pursue my life goals and make them happen. I happen to think that I'm quite goddamn fabulous and up to my eyes in talent. And I'll give up a lot of things to achieve my goals.  \n Oh, you and your wisdom.  You're spot on, I think.  Can't deny it.  I have been cowardly, and I'm not proud of that.  Not at all.    First off, I think you should do what you want, regardless of what people think.  There's nothing quite like the feeling of performing on stage.  It can be exhilirating.\n\nHowever, a lot of burlesque people try to make a distinction between what they do and what we do in the strip club, but when it comes down to brass tacks, stripping is stripping.  It's no surprise that your boyfriend and family would have a problem with this.  Most people do.  If they are dead set against it, there's probably not anything you can say to convince them otherwise.   Hi! a) /r/burlesque exists. I'm not sure how active it is, but people there may be able to talk this through with you.\n\nb) I know a lot of local burlesque performers. Some choose to go down to pasties, some just do bra and panties, some would go full nude if the venue let them. You are going to get to set that comfort level. I think you should mention that to them. \n\nI also think you should mention that a *Stage Kitten is like an intern.* You may occasionally do numbers, which you would dictate the level of nudity in, but mostly you are going to be fetching other women's garter belts from the side of the stage. \n\nc) Have they seen burlesque? Its not stripping the way they probably think stripping is (obligatory \"not that there's anything wrong with that\"). Its a performance art and an homage to the early days of stripping, a call-back actually to a time with slightly \"higher\" moral standards. It can also be a great place to play with gender fuck and drag. There is a great documentary called [\"A Wink And A Smile\"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245369/) that is on Netflix, about women going through a burlesque boot camp. If they are not comfortable with going to a show, maybe you can sit with them and watch that. \n\nBurlesquers I know do different things. Some are nurses or lab assistants. Some are waitresses. Some are studying to do more. If you are going into education or anything involving kids, this is not a good idea unless you create a **very** clear line between your stage role and your personal life. You said elsewhere, however, that you want to be a musician. Burlesque is another art form, one that involves a lot of personal strength and a lot of thought about answering questions about exploitation versus self-fulfillment, sexuality as performance, vulnerability, and myriad other issues.\n\nPM me if you would like me to get you in contact with some current or recent burlesque performers who I know. They would probably be happy to talk with you about it.   So my wife is a burlesque dancer, and a decently prominent one at that (at least where we live). I have a few thoughts on this...\n\nThe first is that you may want to drag this boyfriend out to a few burlesque shows. 1 is not enough. He needs to meet some people who are regulars and get a sense of what the scene is like in your area. Is it a very body positive scene? Are the burlesquers doing interesting acts? Is there a lot of humor and skill? \n\nOnce you go out to the shows he'll probably notice a few things. One, the performers are generally clever, funny, confident and all around awesome people. Some of them are nuts, a couple of divas mixed in, but by and large, the coolest people you could ever hope to meet. They are not desperate or leaping into bed with the first audience member to tip them or any other such non-sense he's likely afraid of. \n\nThe audience for there part is also probably not what he'd expect. Women generally out number men at most shows. Gay men make up a large contingent of the audience. In my area the vintage fashion crowd come to all the classic shows and the ubergeeks come to all the Nerdlesque. And the vast, vast, vast majority of them aren't the slightest bit sexually aggressive. Yeah the woo and yell and applaud at a well executed stocking pull, but they're supposed to do that. It's not uncommon for the host to explain that to them at the beginning. \n \nThe atmosphere is just generally different from your average strip club and so is the audience. I'm friends with many strippers, some of burlesque friends are also strippers, and occasionally a show is at a strip club, I have absolutely nothing against the people we more conventionally think of as strippers, but it is a very different vibe. For starters, a burlesque dancer is playing to a crowd and they're not trying to sell lap dances. This means that the sexuality mainly stays on stage, it's not targeted at an individual man and it doesn't go from man to man trying to sell the fantasy of being with the dancer. \n\nBurlesque dancers don't generally make a whole lot of money (my wife is able to make a decent income and has quit her day job, but she's more of an exception) so it's usually done because the person loves it and not because it's their job. Going to a show is kind of like going to see a friend do theater or performance art (which it is), and when they come off stage that's how they act. (I'd also say that the two most common backgrounds in burlesque are trained actress and graphic designer with writer/english major or dancer/aerobics instructor duking it out for third place. This is because it is an art, and it attracts people with an artistic temperament who do not feel artistically satisfied with their jobs, and most of them get that satisfaction from creating these characters and designing their costumes and getting up on stage and performing their hearts out to an appreciative audience. \n\nMost people start with this default position that you're only nude around your partner and your doctor. They associate what you're doing with sex not with performance. They're not entirely wrong- a part of burlesque is (at least frequently) an expression of sexuality, but that's not the whole point by a long shot and that sexuality is not an effort to get someone to go to bed with the performer. My wife does a number where she's a hideous old witch and another where she's the Cookie Monster. If she was trying to seduce someone, I'm fairly confident she could go through a hell of a lot less effort and be much more effective than dressing up as a beloved children's character or making herself look several hundred years old. \n\nI'm inclined to agree with the people who talk about this as more of a relationship issue than anything else. When my wife first started, I wasn't entirely on board but I was supportive. Once I got to know some of the other dancers and the producers and some of the regulars, it became my social circle and it is so infinitely more awesome than going to a buddy's with a six pack and watching a movie on a Friday night.\n\nSorry- I'm pretty sick and my thoughts are all over the place, but I'm happy to talk about this some more with you or anyone who wants to get into burlesque, or even to talk to a significant other who is struggling with it. It's a real shitload of fun.    So my wife is a burlesque dancer, and a decently prominent one at that (at least where we live).

This means that the sexuality mainly stays on stage, it's not targeted at an individual man and it doesn't go from man to man trying to sell the fantasy of being with the dancer. \n\nBurlesque dancers don't generally make a whole lot of money (my wife is able to make a decent income and has quit her day job, but she's more of an exception) so it's usually done because the person loves it and not because it's their job. Going to a show is kind of like going to see a friend do theater or performance art (which it is), and when they come off stage that's how they act. (I'd also say that the two most common backgrounds in burlesque are trained actress and graphic designer with writer/english major or dancer/aerobics instructor duking it out for third place. This is because it is an art, and it attracts people with an artistic temperament who do not feel artistically satisfied with their jobs, and most of them get that satisfaction from creating these characters and designing their costumes and getting up on stage and performing their hearts out to an appreciative audience. \n\nMost people start with this default position that you're only nude around your partner and your doctor. They associate what you're doing with sex not with performance. They're not entirely wrong- a part of burlesque is (at least frequently) an expression of sexuality, but that's not the whole point by a long shot and that sexuality is not an effort to get someone to go to bed with the performer. My wife does a number where she's a hideous old witch and another where she's the Cookie Monster. If she was trying to seduce someone, I'm fairly confident she could go through a hell of a lot less effort and be much more effective than dressing up as a beloved children's character or making herself look several hundred years old. \n\nI'm inclined to agree with the people who talk about this as more of a relationship issue than anything else. When my wife first started, I wasn't entirely on board but I was supportive. Once I got to know some of the other dancers and the producers and some of the regulars, it became my social circle and it is so infinitely more awesome than going to a buddy's with a six pack and watching a movie on a Friday night.\n\nSorry- I'm pretty sick and my thoughts are all over the place, but I'm happy to talk about this some more with you or anyone who wants to get into burlesque, or even to talk to a significant other who is struggling with it. It's a real shitload of fun.       I have always been happiest with partners who support me in most everything and anything I want to do. It's likely, considering the kind of things that seem to appeal to you, that this wouldn't be the only thing he would try to prevent you from doing, and a relationship like that could make you feel trapped and unhappy. I hope he is willing to listen and communicate with you enough to change his attitude about it, but if not, I hope you can find a partner who will wholeheartedly love your performances. This is exactly the way that I've been feeling.  What I've been hearing from people, so far, is that no man exists who would support me in this endeavor wholeheartedly.\n\nAnd I'm concerned that if my boyfriend doesn't like the idea of skimpy outfits and provocative dancing, then he won't like me performing music on a stage, while wearing showy outfits and - to be blunt - playfully flirting with the audience.  (Being a musician is my life.  Burlesque is a side-interest.)\n\nBasically, I'm wondering if I'll end up hurting him, regardless of what I do!  I don't want him to feel like that, but it seems like my interests are basically bound to make him feel like that. This is exactly the way that I've been feeling.

He thought about it for a moment, then smiled and said, \"tell me more.\"\n\nThere **are** guys who will happily support this kind of decision. Huh.  Crazy.  You make it sound so...easy. lol Oh, I'm well aware of how fortunate I am to have such an awesome guy--he would never discourage me from doing anything I was really interested in.  ;-) You did ask him though \"How would you feel if I did x?\". Would he react exactly the same way if you just said \"I've decided I'm going to do x.\" He'd probably be more surprised and have to think about it a bit longer, but he'd be supportive. What if it was something else that he hated the idea of, like joining the military, or something else that he'd hate? Do you think he'd react differently to that depending on whether you floated it as an idea vs told him you were doing it? \n\nI just really struggle with having things announced to me as fait accompli, if my boyfriend does it it just makes me feel like he puts no weight on whether its going to bother me. I literally cannot think of anything that would spaz him out--short of things like making meth, sleeping around, or demanding a divorce.  If I announce I'm leaving to live on the opposite side of the planet for 5 months he won't like it, but he'll be supportive of my decision.  (This has actually happened.) Huh.  Crazy.  You make it sound so...easy. lol  First off, burlesque is not exactly stripping. I mean it is, but it isn't.  Not that I have a problem with stripping at all, but it is different.\n\nYou aren't collecting bills in your g-string. You are performing a type of seductive tease dance that has been around for a very long time.\n\nIt's up to no one else but yourself. If you want to do it, do it.  If the boyfriend can't handle it, its his problem.\n\nBTW, my boyfriend has been trying for months to get me to try it. We have lots of friends that perform burlesque, and I'm definitely thinking about it.  No, burlesque isn't exactly stripping.  But I've been to burlesque shows and I've been to higher-end strip clubs, and it's essentially the same experience.  Let's not pretend burlesque is something more grandiose than it is. I disagree..I know people who strip amd people who do burlesque.  The burlesque performers spend weeks and months on a single routine, not to mention the expense and work that goes into their costumes.   The strippers rarely choreograph a routine nor practice once they have the essentials down.  First off, burlesque is not exactly stripping. I mean it is, but it isn't.

    "snippet" : "  As someone who collects (a different kind) of doll, this is pretty interesting. I'm really amazed at the amount of skill they have at painting and weighting them to look and feel real. Plus when they're finished, you get all of the cute without the work. These are probably comforting to people who like babies but don't have any around. It seems like they could be helpful in psychological treatment. My mother's boyfriend has a job where he delivers bedding and such to nursing homes, and he's told us that a lot of the old women have baby dolls that really help them feel more at ease, so I can definitely see them helping in psychological treatment in general.

Can anyone explain why this works? I am biased in that I don't want a kid, but even if I did... this seems obsessive to me :/ Can anyone explain why this works? I am biased in that I don't want a kid, but even if I did... this seems obsessive to me :/ If I had a shitton of money it's something I might personally invest in, now that I think about it. I love children, and I love taking care of them, but I have lots of medical conditions that wouldn't make it feasible for me to take care of a child 24/7. Having something like this would probably help fill the void I have from my body wanting a child, but knowing that I just can't physically make those kinds of things work out.  I remember watching an episode of Trading Spouses (or maybe Wife Swap) with one of the mother's collecting these lifelike dolls. It was sad because her children were often neglected because she was too busy spending money on the dolls and spending time taking care of them instead of her live children. I don't see a problem with wanting a forever baby, but not if it causes you to neglect your actual children.

Along the lines of your thought process:\n\n&gt;“In general, most of the women are Anglo, conservative, Christian and right-to-lifers,” Ms. Martinez said.\n\nI wonder how many of those pro-life doll collectors have adopted or tried to adopt actual babies born to women who can't or don't want to be mothers. Or they could be foster parents, if they wanted to cuddle babies but not necessarily raise children. That would also be an option. It's a pattern I see from many (not all) pro-life people. \n\n\"You shouldn't abort a pregnancy, because it's wrong! Just adopt the baby out!\" Often these people have never adopted or fostered a child who is probably lonely, neglected, or even abused in the system, and they frequently have no interest in doing so, ever.

I was thinking the same thing, but adoption costs (and the cost of raising that child after) are expensive. Maybe some of these women would adopt but can't afford it (or are deemed kookoo for cocopuffs and not allowed to adopt).  When I used to work in a nursing home with patients with dementia, we had several dolls like this. It would most certainly calm both the men and the ladies, like pet therapy but available 24/7.  They would instinctively hold them close and gentle and coo them \"to sleep\".  It was sweet.  Oh that is exactly what happened to my grandma! Someone gave her a baby doll to play with because she loved babies but wasn't a fan of the therapy animal they had there (a bird, who was kind of bite-y...not sure why that was the therapy animal of choice, it was odd). She loved it so much. When I used to work in a nursing home with patients with dementia, we had several dolls like this.

This is somehow simultaneously extremely sad, and completely creepy.\n\nOf course, for some subset of these women, it's probably a perfectly happy and harmless thing. When my grandmother was in her 90s and her Alzheimer's had become very severe, she had a baby doll that she seemed to believe was an actual, real baby. We were all worried this would stress her out somehow, but it actually seemed to make her extremely happy; she loved caring for the \"baby\" and talking to her.  I know this is really rude, but I just find myself thinking over and over, \" they need therapy. They obviously need therapy.\" My grandma-in-law has a few. The one she got for Christmas this year closes its hand around her finger. It comforts her. Same with the heartbeat one she sleeps next to. She lives alone (though my MIL and her other children come by quite often, every single day) for the first time in her entire life. She's getting close to the end of her time on earth and I see no harm in it, and no reason to be in therapy. She just likes the feeling. She knows they aren't real. I think her happiest time in life (until very recently, and she's no linger able-bodied) was when she had babies, and the dolls bring back that comfort.  This is a really interesting example. Almost anything that brings comfort during the last stage of life is permissible. What would therapy accomplish at that point? It would be unnecessarily difficult, at a time when she just needs comfort.  This is a really interesting example. Almost anything that brings comfort during the last stage of life is permissible. What would therapy accomplish at that point? It would be unnecessarily difficult, at a time when she just needs comfort.  If anything it would be seen as a kind of therapy in itself. It's... A source of comfort. Therapy is a very specific treatment for emotional problems. In this situation, the problems aren't being resolved (because resolving problems takes work and time, and at the end of your life, that would be a waste of precious energy), but instead this is sort of a stop-gap to provide some comfort. Like emotional morphine. Not treating the problem, just treating the symptom.  Interesting. How does that compare with therapy animals? They are a source of comfort, and have been shown to have positive physiological effects (lower blood pressure, increased oxytocin output, pain relief properties,) but they themselves are not therapy. Owning a pet is healthy, but if you need therapy, you need a trained, licensed therapist to adjuster it. Normally ere are other things that go along with the animal therapy - the therapist has you do other exercises, you don't just per the dog, then go home. \n\nEdit: but it's an interesting comparison you're making, and dolls are used a LOT in therapy with children.  Dolls are used in therapy with children, as I understand, because it's difficult for children to explain their experiences and perceptions, but they can often demonstrate them through doll play. It's a different sort of thing... not the interaction with the doll creating the therapeutic intervention, but being used as a communication tool. They are a source of comfort, and have been shown to have positive physiological effects (lower blood pressure, increased oxytocin output, pain relief properties,) but they themselves are not therapy.

So is \"therapy dog\" a misnomer or is it called a \"therapy dog\" because it's used in conjunction with actual therapy? In conjunction with actual therapy. I'm pretty sure they have other terms for the dogs they bring around hospitals to cheer up the kids.  I know this is really rude, but I just find myself thinking over and over, \" they need therapy. They obviously need therapy.\" This was my initial reaction too. That being that obsessed with a baby is unhealthy. Especially the women who lost children. Which I know is one of the most painful things that can happen to anyone. But I was reminded of my aunt - her son (my cousin) was killed when he was 16. And a year or two after his death I went to visit her, and she kept his room exactly as it had been - half drank bottles of soda and all. And that weekend she kept playing his voicemail message over and over because she had the phone company send her the sound file. And it all seemed really unhealthy to me. I think coping behavior (particularly in the face of something as traumatic as losing a child) can seem pretty bizarre or unhealthy. However, if it's not causing any actual harm to anyone and is perhaps alleviating some of the pain of the situation for the victim, it's generally not something to be too concerned over. It can be disconcerting, though, to outsiders, obviously.\n\nAs long as your aunt is still generally taking care of herself and her living space and her responsibilities, leaving the room as is is probably fine--in fact, I think it's pretty common for people who have lost a close loved one to do so for years or even decades.

I'm sure that were I offered the chance to hold one, I'd probably instinctively try to rock it too.  \nEdit: Also, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF8eHuQuR1o) is a TLC (ugh, I know) clip about a woman who makes dolls like these.

I've only held a baby once in my life and I was petrified. It was so gross and I thought I was going to drop it. :/\n\nSomehow all my mothering instincts have been transferred to cats. Which is good because they are a lot cheaper than miniature people. I feel the same way. Those dolls are terrifying, but to me, infants are even more terrifying. Not like I hate them or anything, but I don't feel that maternal pull towards babies, and I can only think of them crying or vomiting on me or that I hold them wrong and hurt them. Sometimes I feel like I am broken. But hey, like you, I am very mothering towards my pets!   I dont know why but it made me sad.  I dont know why but it made me sad.  I had a friend who died in a freak accident at 20. His mom started collecting dolls like these that resembled him as a baby. It was very, very sad.      I wonder if this is related to the fact that women are having fewer babies now. My great grandma had 22 children, my grandma had 9 my mum had 2. This means that the proportion of their lives spent looking after a baby is now much less than it was. Perhaps the need to care for a baby-like object is a strong evolutionary drive and these people are fulfilling it in a way that does not impact their health or family life. If  it does then it is a problem if it doesn't then -so what?

That's over 16 years of your life spent pregnant, if there aren't any multiples and the pregnancies all go to term. Twenty two live born children- including 2 sets of twins. One child died as a baby but the rest grew up. Boggles the brain really doesn't it? Don't know about any miscarriages but I don't suppose there was a lot of time!! Even with two sets of twins, that's amazing!  You must have a billion cousins.  :)  So, fun story time: My significant others mother has one of these and takes care of it as though it was a real, growing, breathing baby. \n\nI understand the collecting. Doll collecting generally freaks me out (they stare back!), but these are crazy detailed and worth lots of money. The fact that people collect them doesn't really surprise me. I also understand their utility in comforting the elderly.  \n\nBut his mother acts as though it is a baby. She burbs it. She takes it places. It has a cradle in the living room. She has two grown children, and she got the doll after we told her that we would not be having children for at least 5 years. After giving us shame about 'not wanting to carry on the family', she went off and bought herself a grandchild. \n\nHer kids don't seem to find this quite as alarming as I do. They see it as a temporary thing, and I see if as her almost divorcing herself from reality. I rather concerns me as to her ability to interact with the world around her. It has, however, brought a complete stop to the incredibly mean harassment about me not wanting to push out babies. It was getting to the point of 'you're not a woman, you're a horrible person' berating because I'd like to wait to have kids.  Unsolicited advice: when/if you do have kids... have them in a different city from where this woman lives.    Upvote, for one of the most insane things I've ever read. Great article.   I've seen ones that have 'heart beats' and 'breathe' and they terrify me to no end. I have a teddy bear that has a fake heartbeat when you squeeze her. It's quite soothing, actually. Definitely don't doubt it! But the dolls look so real that the added heart beat and breathing scares me haha!   I wonder why so many people think this is a sad thing, when these babies make these women happy?\n\nI don't collect dolls anymore, but the ones I still have from the days when  I did collect (not these kinds of dolls, Sailor Moon dolls lol) have a lot of sentimental value to me and I treat them very carefully. Not just because they have collectors value but because to me as a child they were my best friends, and though I know they are absolutely not alive they still feel that way to me. I don't think of them as children as some of these women might with their dolls, but I can definitely understand how some of these women must feel. I don't think it's something that needs pity. Its a hobby, and as long as its not negatively impacting anyone in their lives who cares if they enjoy it? I don't understand why people look down on these women and assume they must be sad or lonely, when they are simply sincerely enjoying something that you probably don't. I think some people find it sad due to the suggestions and anecdotes about how some people participate in this hobby out of terrible loneliness or in order cope with the loss of children or infertility. The implication is that these women have no one to love and comfort them in a way that can help them heal through relationships with real people, so they direct their emotions toward an inanimate object and play pretend to cope with the reality of their loneliness and sadness.\n\nI'm sure many collectors aren't in that boat and maybe just like the dolls and have fun pretending their real. Of those in sadder situations, it's probably better for them to have some way to comfort themselves, but it's still sad that they can't be fulfilled by interacting with real people or don't have real people to interact with. Then really when they think it's sad they're just projecting things they've heard onto other people, right?

I don't understand why people look down on these women and assume they must be sad or lonely, when they are simply sincerely enjoying something that you probably don't. Sailor Moon dolls?! Which of the senshi did you have?  All of them :D But my Sailor Saturn is only a Dream Pocket because obviously it is the most common and least expensive of all the Saturns. Sailor Saturn was my favorite! I made a fansite dedicated to her, had a costume and everything, but not the doll. :&lt; They are super expensive. They never released a Saturn doll at all in the states, only in Canada and of course Japan. They pop up on eBay now and then but they only rise in price every time I see them. Even my Dream Pocket Saturn was $40 out of box when I got her and now she goes for $70-90 out of box, $150+ in box D: I want to sell mine and buy a Saturn that's more similar in size to the rest of my dolls but I feel like by the time I can afford one she'll have doubled in price, lol. /doll rant OMG, I just looked on eBay and they're all like hundreds of dollars. :(\n\nDo you have any pictures of your dolls you could share? :D Yeah actually! Here's an [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/UcYk5) I took a while back :D Awww there's a little Artemis and Luna! :3 And Card Captor Sakura! That is an awesome collection. Haha the Luna and Artemis were actually key chains from a series of Chibi Figures, but I took the keychain part off of them and used them to play with my dolls as a kid :P Thanks!       Really? Now we are just posting shit to bash on people who have different interests? Shame on all of you who upvoted this, that is what is really sad about this post.",

    "title" : "[Update 2] Well 2x, she's pregnant.  Things are... strange [long]",
    "snippet" : "I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so you're it, 2x.\n\nThese past few days have been so strange.  Awful.  She's a lot less frail, but as we've talked, she's also less certain.  I broke down yesterday and couldn't be strong about it anymore.  I sobbed and cried for what was probably 2 hours.\n\nShe admitted that she likes being pregnant.  She's happy.  She's trying not to get attached to the baby.  She's trying not to think about it what it would be like to have it, but it's impossible not to.\n\nWhat it's come down to is this: she worries we're throwing away our best chance to start a family, even if it is an awkward time.  She rationally thinks it's a bad idea, but emotionally, she wants to keep it.  On top of that though, if I were to tell her that I wasn't ready or didn't want it, she'd terminate it.\n\nSo that basically puts the entire decision onto me.  If I say \"keep it,\" we keep it.  If I say \"I'm not ready,\" she'll go through with the abortion.\n\nI feel **horrible**.  I hate this.  Deep down, I don't want this, but I feel like I can't tell her to go through with it.  It's her body.  It's what I can tell she wants.  It's not what I want.  I'm not ready.  I just don't want to do this.  If I tell her that, she'll get the abortion, and it will crush her.\n\nI feel like no matter what I do, it's the wrong decision.  If I get what I want, I feel like I'll scar her forever.  If I tell her we should keep it, I'll be thrust into parenthood by a pregnancy I don't want and don't feel prepared for.\n\nOur financial situation and her education sits on top of all of that.  Maybe I could find a better job.  Maybe she'll find a job that can work with a pregnant woman.  Maybe I won't.  Maybe we'll end up making a huge financial sacrifice and impoverishing ourselves, permanently downgrading our quality of life.  There are so many questions.\n\nI feel alone.  I feel like the weight is entirely on me.\n\nChoice feels like the most difficult thing in the world.\n\nI'm just rambling.  Thanks for listening.  Your comments have been really supportive.  This whole thing is just... awful.  No matter what you tell her, it's going to be the hardest thing you'll have to say. Whether you go with option A or B as related above, the weight of both of your futures is in your hands and that's not easy or fair.\n\nSo I wonder if the best thing would be to tell her exactly what you've told us here. Tell her your fears, your doubts. Tell her you don't want to be the decider, that her voice and desires need to be taken into account as well, but be honest about yours at the same time. \n\nThese conversations will never be easy. So they might as well be honest, so there's no regret in keeping the truth to yourself for the sake of hurt feelings.  THIS. SO MUCH.\n\nThis is NOT a decision one party should make, and not a position you should let yourself be pushed into. If that happens, blame will be put on you, no matter what the decision. It's gonna be: \"You made me abort!\" or \"You wanted this child!\" \nI am not saying she will necessarily do this, but it might happen. And it's neither right nor fair nor good. \n\nYou need to talk this out. Any decision will have to come out of what you both want, with no responsiblity shifting.     Forgive me if it has been said already, but has the compromise of adoption been contemplated? I do not mean to imply that you have been rash in your thinking either, as I am rather sorry that you are found in this predicament friend.    Have you considered adoption? That could be plan C. You could support her and help her choose parents that would be the best suited to raise your child. It could be an open adoption, so you will always know how the child is doing. You could get letters, or phone calls or even visits. There are varying degrees of open adoption that range from what I just listed, to no identifying information until the child is an adult.   Is she mindful of how much pregnancy hormones influence the desire for motherhood?   It's probably why she's having a hard time making up her mind.   Pregnant women are so affected by the hormones that they begin \"nesting\", suddenly strive for cleanliness, and are especially freaked out by insects.   These are just some of the anecdotes you'll find if you search online, along with the happy feelings associated with being pregnant.  \n\nYou're right that you can't make the choice for her.   Find some articles about how much hormones can influence someone during pregnancy, and share them.   Then spell out your mutual finances and goals.   Tell her to really think about this, and be sure to say how much you want a family with her in the future.   (Assuming that is true?)\n\nUpdate us! This is such a stereotypical misleading caricaturization of the supposed behaviour of the pregnant woman, I had to double check it wasn't suddenly 1950 in here.\n\nHey OP, whatever you do, DON'T tell your wife her hormones are affecting her ability to make a rational decision.  Actually, Googling \"pregnancy, hormones, nesting\" brought up a wealth of legit articles for me.\n\nI agree that OP should be careful about how he brings up the subject of hormones to his pregnant wife, but at the same time you can't ignore their existence either. The range of pregnancy symptoms is as varied as the woman that experience it, and they range from undetectable to bliss to morbid depression.\n\n\"Hey honey, be mindful how much the hormones in your body are influencing what you want.\"\n\nThis is the same attitude that prompts men to invalidate any \"unpleasant\" behaviour from women by saying \"oh, she must be on the rag.\"  Dismissing women's behaviour because, \"hormones.\" They used to simply call this \"woman's weak, erratic nature.\" We just give it a more scientific name now.\n\nKeep downvoting me, but I reiterate to OP- don't question her feelings in this way. Wow, hostile much? I didn't downvote you, and you'll find that I also agreed with you.\n\nThe only thing I pointed out differently is that we shouldn't completely ignore the effects hormones can and do have on us, even to the point of influencing our decisions. That was more of a general comment to the down votes I got for disagreeing with the original comment, not directed at you. Could've made that more clear.\n\nThe only thing I'm hostile towards is questioning and evaluating the validity of women's feelings differently due to hormones. And rightly so. Im sick of reading this crap on the rest of reddit and cant believe I'm seeing on this subreddit of all places. More from the other comment, not from yours. But I don't think being pregnant makes you handicapped in anyway, and taking OPs wife's feelings, at face value, is enough. When you don't, her experience is devalued completely.\n\nALL of our feelings are the result of chemical impulses, and I reiterate if OP comes close to implying her wishes are coming from somewhere less than authentic and should be tempered accordingly- frankly that is gross. And bad advice.\n\nAlso- quick edit- I'm on my phone, this is probably typo city  Some women respond very, very badly to being pregnant. I will not go into detail about my own experience but it was awful. I do understand your resentment of the long history of invalidating women based upon hormonal issues, but it was true for me. Based upon my own experience I think the issue is worth discussing between OP and his wife. This is such a stereotypical misleading caricaturization of the supposed behaviour of the pregnant woman, I had to double check it wasn't suddenly 1950 in here.\n\nHey OP, whatever you do, DON'T tell your wife her hormones are affecting her ability to make a rational decision.

The more you think about being oppressed, the more you'll feel oppressed. That might actually inhibit your reporting.  Male journalist here. For what it's worth I have worked for a female editor, have lots of female colleagues, etc. and never saw/heard anything like this. I feel like this piece is trying to portray the industry at large as being particularly misogynistic, and I just think that's blatantly false.  I totally agree. I've never felt discriminated against in this industry. Ever. Yes, people have pointed out the fact that I'm female, but never in a derogatory way. \n\nMaybe it's because I mostly work with features and light news and not \"male\" topics like sports or finance. (I do work in music journalism though. Music is a male-dominated industry and I've never had a source or boss talk down to me because I'm female.) I also don't deal with international news. Women reporting in the Middle East certainly have it rough.  \n\nHowever, I've never felt like I was hired or rejected from a job simply because I'm female.

A big, big Betacam, probabily heavier than me (LOL). Weren't rare the occasions where people would ask \"can you carry THAT on your back\"?? They were probably more impressed than worried about the fragile girl. That's my guess at least.    I'm a \"lady journalist\" and usually the only sexist things I hear directed towards me are from sources, not from colleagues. Though I have heard colleagues say sexist things, they didn't realize they were being sexist until I pointed it out. Then they apologized.\n\nHowever, some of these are pretty bad and aren't really laughable. Maybe I'm just sensitive because I hear a lot of sexist comments in my area, but a lot of these are really disrespectful. ",

    "snippet" : "Hey, \nThis is my first time posting anything, just feeling like I could do with a bit of support... hope I'm doing it right. Sorry for the length of this. I (f22) recently started getting abused, physically and emotionally, by partner of about one year (m26).\n\nA month ago we moved to a new country together, were \"best friends\" and totally in love. We could talk about anything together, we had talked openly from day one and had been open about wanting to grow old together, we had a million sayings that only we 'got'. Back home, he rarely over indulged in alcohol, BUT for the past month, I don't think a day went by without him having a drink. This became a problem and escalated his anger, even when not drunk it seemed. He was never really that angry before we came here. I think because I was more isolated here he felt he had more control over me, and the more scared I felt.\n\nAnyhow, last Saturday-  the morning after the serious physical abuse and threats to kill me (mild physical abuse went on occasionally for 6 days before this, emotional a bit longer), while he was out I packed my stuff and left. I don't know many people in the city and most of the people I do know were through him. A kind family member lives a bit out of the city and picked me up.\nI have filed a police report and a court date has been set.\n\nI have email contact with a few close friends from home but I don't feel like I can go back there, I didn't move here for him and I don't want to leave because of him. He owed me a bit of money and was counting on that to live for the next couple of months while I found a job, so money is a bit of an issue on top of this (I recently graduated from university so not much savings). My friends have been very supportive but don't really understand what I'm going through, and an email can only help so much.\n\nThe hardest part is being alone, my family member is out during the day and I don't know them well enough to talk to them about it much. I do seem to hold it together OK during the day, keeping occupied with housework, walking the dog etc. \n\n\n**Night time is the absolute worst** (hence this post at 2am through a foggy cloud of tears). I feel like my entire stomach/ heart/ throat has been ripped out from inside me. \n\nI feel stupid and pathetic, but I just can't sleep. I feel empty and broken, I barely recognise myself sometimes (mainly this night time thing). I just hate lying there on my own, as I close my eyes and try to sleep, I can't stop imaging lying in his arms and what comfort that used to bring me, the love I used to feel when I was with him.\n\nI don't want him back - I just don't know how to deal with this\n\nAny words of wisdom would be so very much appreciated\n\nTLDR: ended abusive relationship, feel too alone and sad to sleep. Help\n  Being in this situation takes a heavy toll on your heart, but you should know that it gets better.  I was in an abusive relationship (emotional, he also threatened and went through with hurting himself) and I know how painful it is seeing someone you loved turn into something so awful.  You should be extremely proud of yourself for getting out when you did and never doubt you did the right thing.  You are stronger than you think, and it's good that you are trying to keep occupied (that was going to be my first piece of advice).  I know how especially tough nights can be, you could try falling asleep to a movie, or reading a book in bed.  When I'm upset I jump in the shower and let the water calm me. Also maybe spend more time with your dog (teaching it new tricks, exploring new parks or trails, I'm not sure how much of this you already do).  The key is to stay busy with things that make you happy, and love who you are.  Try writing yourself encouraging post it notes to stick around the house and find later :)  Remember you are one of a kind, never let anyone treat you like you aren't. \n\nEdit: Also for sleeping, try waking up earlier so you will be more tired later on and more easily fall asleep.  Also thinking of things you want to do the next day will keep your mind off more touchy subjects.  &gt;Try writing yourself encouraging post it notes to stick around the house and find later\n\nThis is excellent advice. I found that writing myself notes when I was feeling most down helped me get back into a healthier head space. OP, things will get better. You are strong for getting yourself out of this situation, and you have a good future ahead of you. Don't bottle up these feelings, and please do not feel embarrassed or ashamed for the emotional roller coaster that you're riding. \n\nDo you have any hobbies? Do you like to cook? I found that baking bread and kneading the dough by hand is great therapy for me. Running works too, or any sort of physical activity that really gets your heart pumping. Good luck, and keep your chin up.  thank you! much appreciated :)\nkneading bread sounds perfect haha\nneed to find where the closest pools are I think, bit of a water baby, that would definitely help Do it!

Am also loving making lists of things I need to do which helps as well.

Also maybe spend more time with your dog (teaching it new tricks, exploring new parks or trails, I'm not sure how much of this you already do).  The key is to stay busy with things that make you happy, and love who you are.  Try writing yourself encouraging post it notes to stick around the house and find later :)  Remember you are one of a kind, never let anyone treat you like you aren't. \n\nEdit: Also for sleeping, try waking up earlier so you will be more tired later on and more easily fall asleep.  Also thinking of things you want to do the next day will keep your mind off more touchy subjects.  It sounds too much like \"hit the gym\", but physical activity during the day helps your body be tired enough to sleep even if your brain isn't there yet.  Walks, housework, exercise... whatever you prefer.  Hey - that's a rough situation. My heart goes out to you. \n\nI don't know if this will help or not, since the advice is more focused towards letting go of grudges ... but I [came across this](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/16x17f/hi_rpsychology_im_looking_for_advice_or_a_good/c80925j) while browsing /r/bestof this morning, and thought it might have some relevance for you. It resonated for me because I write everything out as a way of dealing with my emotional issues, and it's helped me to let go of a lot of past baggage. \n\nWhen I left my ex, I found the nights to be the hardest as well. I left for different reasons, but I spent a lot of time feeling alone, guilty, lost, and filled with sadness and tears. I found that it helped me to write it all down, to get into a shower with water almost hotter than I could bear and cry it all out, and to get out and be active. Yoga and running helped a lot.\n\nAnd while it's probably really scary and hard in a new city, getting out there and making your own new friends would be really worthwhile too. Long distance friends can only offer so much, and it's nice to have people who are right there and able to go out, spend time with you, and take your mind off of things. Maybe see if there's a support group in your area for people who have gone through similar situations to you?  What you did was seriously brave. Everyone thinks it should be easy to walk out of a situation like yours, but it's harder than it looks. You're brave, you're strong, and you're an inspiration.  I'm realy sorry you went through such a terrible experience. I want you to know, if you don't already, you did absolutely nothing to cause this, all the responsibility is on his part. No one deserves to be treated that way.\n\nI've been through my share of bad relationships, though physical violence hasn't been a very big part of my experience, but everything else has, and I did experience some physical violence, and I can relate to a lot of what you wrote. \n\nI agree with the others, you show a lot of strength in getting out and going to the police. You did the right thing. \n\nIt sounds like there weren't \"red flags\" in this, that his behavior was a result of the alcohol which is something you never could have known or gotten signs of how he was going to become. You may want to look over some information about the possible warning signs of abusers to make sure for your own future that there was not something that could have been an indication, as a possible future protection for yourself. But like I said, it sounds like the alcohol just made him crazy, I know it can happen. Not that its an excuse on his part-alcohol or not, he had no right to treat you that way, but just as a possible explanation.\n\nIf you can give yourself the love that you're missing right now it may help. Be compassionate towards yourself, its impossible to always predict things in life and unfortunately bad things happen to good people. But you can be your own friend in this, treat yourself with fun or good things, take good care of yourself. It may even help to find a therapist to talk to to sort out some hard feelings, it doesn't mean anything bad about you to talk with someone who may help sort things out. Sometimes they're helpful.\n\nSending you support in this difficult time-  From your verbiage and spelling, I would guess that you live in a country that provides free or low-cost medical care.  I highly encourage you to contact a therapist.  You have been through something highly traumatic, and a good therapist can help you deal with that. Thanks, I'm new to the country I'm living in at the moment and thinking I might move cities - once I've got an income and a more stable environment I think that's probably not a bad idea. Until then I think I'll try to keep a bit of a record of my days, things that are bringing me down and things that bring me up, reflect and make a plan one day at a time It sounds like you have a plan, so keep going and recognize that things will get better.  **DeviousDaffodil** said\n&gt; After my break-up I saw a therapist who helped me not only with getting over everything, but also career counseling, and planning my future. The right professional can make all the difference.\n\nIf the country you are in has public health care or support centers, they may be able to provide free or cheap therapy. Also see if there is a crisis phoneline that can help.\n\nAlso, OP, you are three or fours days out from this and you are doing **great**. You got out of the situation. You reported it to the police. You are aware of yourself and your needs for the future. I'm impressed and proud of you. \n\n&gt; My friends have been very supportive but don't really understand what I'm going through, and an email can only help so much.\n\nCan you call anyone? Skype? \n\nI also would like to emphasize the importance of an earlier sleep schedule. It helps to keep yourself from falling into a depression when you are already starting your recovery from trauma. Melatonin has been a god-send for me when I am going through sleepless periods and need to regulate my sleep cycle to something healthy. \n\nAlso: I have no idea where you are, but there is a giant internet hug or shoulder or whatever you need right there for you.  This is going to be very hard on you for a while, but it does get better and you will get through it. I would suggest finding someone like a social worker that you can talk to. There should be some free resources in your area and any doctor will be able to recommend some to you. There are also women's help lines that you can call 24/7 who are more than happy to just talk to you if you are feeling alone in the middle of the night. I know its not the same as feeling a loved ones arms around you, but it will probably help enough to get you through the worst of it. \n\nI am so glad you are out of that awful situation and I commend your strength to leave him. It took me a lot longer than you to get out, and I know you might not feel proud of yourself but I'm proud of you :). Keep your chin up and find some activities that you enjoy to keep yourself busy. It will get better, I promise.  I was in a similar situation but stayed way too long, until I had to put my ex in prison. Way to go girl. You are incredibly smart for getting out when you did. Not everyone has it in them to do it when they need to, and you're setting a great example for other people in similar situations. I know it's hard right now, and that being somewhere new may make you feel more isolated than normal, but I think you're right by staying. This is a great opportunity to meet new people and really begin your life now that you've graduated. But I know most of that doesn't matter right now, and right now you're hurt.\n     Getting some sleep will definitely help you, and everyone's given excellent advice. Think about herbal teas and things to help calm you, and try to establish a relatively normal bed routine. This could help your body condition itself to go to bed. For a few months I could only sleep with a television on, if it's something quirky like that to make you feel less alone, go for it. You will feel better in time, but until then try to find an activity or job to stay busy. And therapy can be a great option for all kinds of things! After my break-up I saw a therapist who helped me not only with getting over everything, but also career counseling, and planning my future. The right professional can make all the difference. My heart goes out to you. Good Luck!  I'm sorry this happened to you. While I don't have any advice for you as I've never been in this position, /r/relationships are a great sub for this type of issue. Good luck.   So sorry this happened to you... as a practical piece of advice - get up early so you'll get tired earlier. The mind goes to dark places at night, so you just need to go to bed before it hits.\n\nIn order to not feel so alone, try checking out [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) for groups around your age that might get together (for hiking, bowling, karaoke, pub night, quilting, whatever!!), and you might be able to make some friends with some similar interests. I did that when I moved to a new country, and made some awesome friends.   Thank you, will work on sleep hygiene as #1 priority from today.\nHadn't heard of that site, looks great I'll have a browse for sure!\nThanks!!! Glad to help - and seriously, give it a shot! The first meetup I went to ended up being mostly middle-aged people, but I tried a few others and eventually found some people my age. Plus it's a great way to discover cool things to do in your area. :)  WELL DONE!!! on being strong and independent and getting out of that toxic situation. I don't have much advice, just had to say that, but maybe some volunteering or something? It's free (obv) and you can meet nice people (new friends!).  I have a friend who came to the US for a man about 9 years ago. They had a beautiful daughter, and then things went to shit for her. She's from Poland, and while she'd love to go back, it would mean never seeing her daughter again. And then there's the whole money issue... she couldn't go back to Poland if she wanted. \n\nSo what is she doing? Making a life for herself and her daughter the best that she can here. She has the occasional relationship, but hasn't found the right person for her. In the mean time, she's doing the best she can.\n\nHope Iga's story helps you. ",

    "snippet" : "Okay. So my friend has been with his girlfriend for about 2.5 years. I've only known him since August, which means I don't really have a RIGHT to say a lot of what I want to say to him, but basically things are like this:\n\nHe adores her. He always lovingly compliments her. He never says a single negative thing about her nor will he accept anyone else saying anything negative about her.\n\nOn the other hand, she loves talking crap about him. One example - he's very, very proud of the college he goes to and rarely accepts any shit from anyone about it - except her, who openly mocks and insults it all the time, and he never asks her to stop. And this is a recurring pattern - she says very negative things to him that invalidate his feelings, he accepts it and doesn't protest. Or parrots her even if he clearly disagrees. \n\nShe also blames him for things that were out of his control. This Valentine's Day he was trying to get a ride to go visit her (because she has yet to visit him, because she refuses to, because she hates his school so much, and he always has to be the one to visit her). He doesn't have a car. He couldn't get a ride, and she got extremely upset at him. Then on Valentine's Day he went to do an assignment and she got furious because \"the assignment wasn't due that day\" even though she and everyone else knows he struggles very hard with completing work on time - in fact, he almost failed last semester - and should have been, imo, congratulating him on working on an assignment ahead of time. But no, she just got furious. And then she told him as punishment/to make it up to her (for something that is, again, not his fault), he would not be allowed to go to a major school party this weekend (very big deal and huge part of the school culture) because there MIGHT be girls hitting on him and she wants to skype with him that night. Granted, she has gone to tons of clubs and even played spin the bottle in the past few weeks. Then come the night of the event, she goes out to the movies - not on her Skype date with him - but he's still not allowed to go to the party. And what's more, he feels guilty about the whole ordeal of not being able to visit her. He genuinely feels like he was in the wrong. Even though he had done nothing wrong at all. \n\nAnd this is a reoccuring pattern. She even expressed frustration to me a while ago about people calling their relationship awful \"because they just don't know our business\". Of course, this means that multiple people have, in the past, called out their relationship for being awful.\n\nAgain, I've only known him since August. I don't know what to do or how to help him, because he refuses to hear anything negative about her. But she is, imo, extremely toxic for him. He's cried a few times from the intense guilt she makes him feel and truly genuinely will not stand up to her. I'm really concerned for him and there's nothing I can do and no real leg to stand on to confront him.\n\nAlso, I befriended her (before I realized how toxic their relationship was). Sometimes I figured hearing her side of the story would reveal that he had indeed done something wrong, but I've found that it almost always just shows more shittiness on her part. \n\nOh, another incident I just remembered - one time, when he did get a ride to go up to visit her, she yelled at him (awfully, from what I heard from the driver) about where he was dropped off - which of course, only the driver controlled. \n\nSo that's the situation I'm in and I'd really like some advice. How do I help him without 'triggering' him to defend his girlfriend?      A good place to start would be to offer yourself as a shoulder to cry on, showing that you support him without saying anything about his girlfriend that might offend him. Point out that he seems stressed out or a bit down or whatever the case may be, and tell him that you're there if he ever needs to talk. When he does mention the horrible things his girlfriend does or says to him, don't criticise her but her actions - encourage him to bring it up with her that some of her words and actions can be hurtful (bearing in mind that it's entirely possible that this girl doesn't even realise she's being manipulative and controlling). The more he's able to communicate about his relationship with other people and hear their viewpoints, the more he'll realise what the bad parts of his relationship are, and the more open he'll be to the idea that maybe they're not right for each other. This is all just my opinion, I've not been in this particular situation myself, but it's what I would do if I were in your shoes.  I've done the 'been there for him while he cries' but, but I always feel awkward trying to toe the line between not insulting her and still pointing out that her actions are unfair. It's a tough one. :/",

    "snippet" : "Warning: this is about to be a huge rant. I'm so sorry!\n\nI was so excited to come to college this past fall because it would be my first time out on my own, making my own decisions -- my first foray into adulthood and independence! After the first few exciting weeks, the activities started to die down and the real grind of work kicked in, along with some crippling homesickness. My parents have always been two of my best friends. When I was in high school and got ditched by some of my friends for more exciting plans, my parents would spend their whole weekends hanging out with me. My mom and I would get our nails done together, and we'd shop, and we'd have a grand old time. I really look up to and respect my mom. There are a lot of qualities about her that I want to see myself with one day. She's a great role model, and we love each other very much.\n\nThe problem is, we're not on the same page about something in particular: the very independence I was so excited to start experiencing last fall. In my opinion, I'm eighteen (I have been for some time) and living away from home for most of the year -- I should be able to operate sort of autonomously, without much interference from her. She texts me every day. Last weekend, she asked if it was OK for her to come visit me at college even though I'm coming home for a break next weekend. I have no classes on Fridays, but when I had a school-sanctioned break that really only consisted of a Friday free of classes (plus Saturday and Sunday off) she insisted I come home to visit. And even now, I'm working on a play (theatre major) that has rehearsals over Spring Break, and she expects me to tell them that my mom wants me home for the week, so I can't come back to my college town early. I've tried explaining that I need some space, especially when it comes to establishing my professional reputation (and that no professional director is going to take \"my mom won't let me\" as an excuse for an absence), but she takes it all so personally and thinks I don't want to be around her. Over Christmas Break, my boyfriend deployed overseas, and she would sort of make me feel guilty for spending so much time with him before he left because it meant that I wasn't spending it with her. The thing is though, when we spend time together, it typically just consists of us sitting in the living room on our computers watching TV. I mean, I love my mom, and spending time with her is important to me, but I feel like I'm being smothered a little. What if I just wanted to stay at school over spring break and enjoy the introvert time? I can't imagine her being okay with that. And, one day soon, I'll probably want to spend a summer away from home working at an internship or something like that, but I'm not sure I could even try to broach that topic without her getting upset. \n\nThere's also the issue of my boyfriend (22). I feel like my parents should have no say in how I choose to conduct myself with my boyfriend. I'm on the pill, we're monogamous, and we love each other. My parents like him a whole lot, they think he's good to me, and they're totally fine with us dating, but they act like I'm still this pure thing that needs to be protected from all men. They're not even religious in the slightest, but they act like they have to protect my (long-gone) flower with all they've got. He and I are going on a trip together this summer with some friends, and the only way to get my parents to agree to letting me go with them was to assure them that he and I would not be sharing a room. He's in the military, and before his current deployment, I wanted to go to see him for a couple days before he left. He had a hotel room and arrangements were all made, but they refused to let me stay with him and made me stay with my grandparents who live nearby the base. Before he freakin' deployed! There's no way they can think that I'm not having sex with this man that I love, and there's no way that they can actually think that them forbidding me to sleep in the same bed as him a couple important nights before he left (for months) would keep me from doing it. My mom even knows that I stay at his apartment many nights when he and I are both at school. I know for a fact that my parents were living together for at least a year before they were married. They can't be oblivious. I think they just don't want to think about it. I also think that the actions that occur in my relationship should be none of their business. I know they're uncomfortable with that, so I'd never go against their wishes in their house (and I've told them that), but I think they need to butt out. \n\nThere's definitely a double-standard between how my parents treat my brother (21) and how they treat me. I get that he's older, so they give him a lot more space, but when he was my age, they never asked where he was going at night. Occasionally they'd ask who he was going to be with, but for the most part, they just assumed they'd see him sometime. He'd ignore their texts and calls for weeks at a time, and though I saw how much it hurt my parents to feel like he was cutting them out, they started letting him do his own thing. Currently, he's not in school and he's living at home while he's saving up money, but he spends every night at his girlfriend's apartment. They realize this, but shrug it off because they \"cant control what he does.\" I certainly don't want to hurt them and make them feel like they're not important to me anymore, but I don't know how to set the boundaries of my own life. \n\nBasically, I guess I'm just worried that my mom (and my dad, I suppose) still thinks of me as a child that she needs to check in on. I know I'll always be her baby, and I like that. My mom's a really cool gal. But I pretty much view myself as an adult. I know that I probably sound like a whiney teenager right now, but I really need some advice from you all who have had to do this. I definitely don't want to cut the cord with my mom, because I want her in my life, but I need to feel like I'm on my own, or I'll never learn how to be independent. \n\nSorry for the long rant, and I'm really sorry if I sound dumb and stupid. Any advice is helpful. Thanks, twox.  Bear in mind, your mother needs to adjust to your absence, too. She'll always see you as her little girl. I'm 32, married, and my parents still lord over me (Asian parents -- whole 'nuther species, IMHO).\n\nI know  you wanna fly, bird, but pick your battles. It's your best chance to get the independence you need, without alienating the ones you love. Indulge them the separate hotel rooms thing. It's not a big deal. The big picture is that they're not trying to drive a wedge between you and your military man. Be glad for that. You're right. I really don't want to alienate them - just want them to know that it's ok to start letting me go a couple days without a check-in or to let me handle my relationship on my own. But you're totally right.  *sigh* ok - first of all, as I write this response to you I am going to sound *exactly* like my mother - and I hate that - but now that I am a parent, *I finally understand*\n\nIt's so incredibly hard to explain because unless you have a child, you don't know what it feels like to have them fly the nest. When I was 24, I left London, England and moved to New York. It was *awesome* but it was really hard for my mum and I didn't understand why.  She adjusted but having her baby leave the nest wasn't easy (especially leaving for another country 3,000 miles away!)\n\nYour mum just wants to have you near her as often as she can.  This is probably a difficult adjustment for her so don't be too hard on her because you *will* hurt her feelings if you tell her you don't want to spend time with her.\n\nIt's great that you're asserting your independence - and you should - but understand where your parents are coming from;  when they seem to be hard on you, it's because they've been where you are before.  They are just trying to protect you.  \n\nDo try and spend some time with your mum - and also do the things you want to do.  There's a balance that needs to be made, a healthy balance - your mum texts you every day because she misses you.  Text her back, tell her everyday that you love her and you miss her.  That's all she wants.  \n\nIt's not that they think of you of a child - it's that they are worried about you.  I can't imagine my daughter growing up and leaving home (she's only a year old at the moment!). It fills me with dread but at the same time, I want her to be independent and travel the world - I am going to encourage it because I think travelling is a great way to grow and become cultured.  But I'm not going to lie, when that time comes, I'm going to text her every day... :)\n\n:)             ",

    "snippet" : "Hi, please help as Google keeps telling me different things! \n\nI did not have sex but 'sort of' did because there was slight penetration. There was also a lot of precum. I bled a little after fingering and slight penetration but I think it's because my parts aren't used to having fingers and stuff up there (couldn't even put in a tampon right) and it was a little rough anyway. I haven't taken any form of birth control previously.\n\nAnyway, given my extreme paranoia and obsessiveness, I had to take the ECP for my mind to be at ease. The bleeding from before continued for about a day and stopped. \n\nFour days after taking the pill, I noticed some spotting in the morning. Now it's gotten heavier and it's not my period because it's not clotty and my period doesn't come until next week. I looked it up and apparently irregular bleeding in between your cycle is a common side effect however I believe that there is something wrong as the blood flow just keeps increasing and it hasn't stopped all day today.\n\nOther effects I've been feeling are slight nausea, breast tenderness which only started being noticeable a few hours ago, and some lower abdominal pain that subsided within a few days as well as some really mild period cramps.\n\nIs any of this normal? Anyone care to share their experiences? Please help me!\n\nEDIT: Added more details  This is all very normal. A plan B pill is basically an over does of birth control. When I forget to take one of my birth control pills, and take 2 at the same time, this happens to me. It starts off as spotting, but it turns into enough to be a period, but it's dark brown and very runny. Due to the increase in hormones in your body (which you are not used to as you have never been on a birth control) its very normal to have sore breasts and some nausea. It sound like you are going through all the normal side effects. Your cycle may be off as well now. When I had to take a plan b i had some spotting and then my period didn't show up at all for 2-3 months. If you are concerned you can always call a pharmacist and ask questions and they will let you know if everything is okay :) but I think it is.  How long did your bleeding last? And thanks, I think I will call a health line (:",

What can I do to help my husband in this situation and keep myself sane in the process... I'm losing it ladies...  (((hugs))))\n\nI feel for you!  Give him hugs, tell him you love him, ask him what he needs from you.  And help wherever you can.\n\nRemember none of this is about you.  It is about him possibly losing his father.  One of the top stressful events in a person's life.  Just love him and hold him, and listen to him.  \n\nHe will vent, he may say hurtful things to you.  Just remember that this is not about you.  He is going through the grief process and may lash out.  Don't respond to his anger.  Hold him through his grief.  Listen through his bargaining and denial.  \n\nTake care of yourself so you can take care of him.  Make certain he gets enough to eat and sleep and clean clothing to wear.  He won't be thinking about those things right now.  Make certain his work knows what is going on so they can make arrangements for it.

So what if you can't stand Aunt Carol's casserole?  Say thank you, put it in the freezer and serve it when more than 5 people come over.  We live out of state and are both military. My job just called me back so I'm not by his side anymore which is causing me great stress. He's not in denial but he is in the I was a bad kid, I didn't call enough stage. I went through this with my grandmother and I really want FIL to pull through and the doctors have told us not to worry too much, but I never trust doctors. Family is supportive but broken on his side. People/siblings/grandparents that haven't talked to anyone in decades all came out and want a say. \n\nI'm just stressed and he's stressed and he won't say anything to anyone. He's talked to me about wanting those individuals to GTFO but he won't say that to them or let me ask them to back off some... And you DON\"T say anything to those individuals to GTFO.  Because that is his anger talking right now.  Not his rational mind. OK?\n\nThere may be fights.  There may be fisticuffs (my ex-husbands family specialized in those at funerals and weddings).  It has nothing to do with you.  Stay out of it.  You are there for him.  Talk to him daily if he wants.  Listen to him.  Ask him questions - How does that make you feel?  What do you think would help?  How can you make it better?  How can I make it better?  - repeat ad nauseum.    \n\nIF you are back on base, get some counseling.  Family counseling does not count against a security clearance.  Including a TS/SCI.  I have one, and I have had years of family counseling.  It will help you support him in the best way for him, and keep your stress levels from getting too high. We live out of state and are both military.

    "title" : "Just broke up with my bf, who's an amazing guy... I thought I would feel more relief, but my feelings are pretty mixed.",
    "snippet" : "TL;DR: Broke up with an amazing guy just now (a few hours ago). The pros definitely outweighed the cons (in my opinion) for this guy. I will even go as far to say that this guy set the bar pretty high for any future boyfriends, that's how highly I think of him. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel that spark/romantic chemistry towards him. Relationship lasted just shy of the one year mark. It was a mutual breakup (but I initiated it). I feel like I should be relieved and that's what I thought I would feel once the break up happened. Instead I'm feeling pretty mixed and a bit broken... never thought I would feel this way either.\n\nAny words of advice or just words of comfort would be appreciated. If you went through a similar situation, I would definitely love to hear your story. \n\nMore details below- \nI didn't really start dating until I was 27, almost 28. And by dating, I mean I met 3 guys off OkCupid. One of which, before we even met, I already established I was only interested in a friendship, and the other I didn't really click with (1 date). The third was my ex. In the time we've been together, I don't think I ever truly felt that spark or excitement, or even the initial butterfly feelings for my ex. If I did, they were fleeting and rare. (I do understand that the butterflies you get or the gushy lovey feelings you get tends to/may subside over time and won't always be there, but not having them, not even in the beginning, is weird, right?) This is probably a good time to say that I struggle with social anxiety. I wasn't sure if it was my social anxiety getting in the way of me feeling anything, especially towards the beginning. Since this was my first time dating, first real relationship, etc. my social anxiety flared up really badly, particularly at the start. I kept giving it time in hopes that if I got more comfortable with him or got to know him better than maybe something more would develop, but it never did. \n\nWhy didn't I break it off sooner and continue to date for so long? We got along very well. In the time that we were together we never got into any major arguments. I think our personalities were pretty similar too (e.g. neither of us are major party people, neither of us liked to drink, more introverted than extroverted, etc.). Since this was the first time I really dated, I was ok with just casual dating if that was all this ended up to be. I went in with no expectations. I just wanted to get myself out there. (I ain't getting any younger!)\n\nI always thought that when I (or he) decided to finally call it quits, it would be easy to take/handle. If my feelings for him weren't that strong, then it shouldn't be hard right? I was a lot emotional than I thought I would be. The days leading up to this, I would cry randomly. Constantly doubting myself and if this was the right thing to do. But I also knew it in my gut that I needed to break up with him. That it's not fair (to either of us) to continue if I just wasn't feeling it. The break itself up went fine, aside from my crying/break down. (I just could not hold the tears in. I'm on my period now so I blame PMS for being extra emotional.) He apparently was on the same page and mentioned that he was thinking about doing the same a few weeks back but didn't. (I was a bit unclear as to why... I think he said because we were busy, but we weren't... anyways, not important)\n\nHere's the messed up part (on my end, not his). He has always been very adamant about not staying friends with his exes. He feels like staying friends right after a breakup makes it harder to move on, and he likes to give it time before evaluating whether or not a friendship would work later down the road. When we almost broke up in Jan, he mentioned that he didn't want to stay friends. That if we broke up, it would have to be a clean break. At that time, he did mention that he was starting to get more attached. Perhaps since he didn't feel a change in me/my feelings, whatever feelings he had also subsided? No idea... He said that he would be fine staying friends after the breakup today (since we get along so well and didn't really have any major issues), basically he has no bad feelings about me or the relationship, and he'd leave the ball in my court to make the first contact. I should have been happy to hear this, but a part of me was like... what, did I just hear you right? I don't understand this reaction of mine. Maybe I'm a bit disappointed, but why would I be? I should be honored that he felt that way, but I'm feeling kind of mixed about it. And I feel horrible for feeling mixed about it. We broke up on good terms, what else could I want?\n\nAnother thing that kind of bothers me (and it shouldn't)... I know that my ex moves on quickly from relationships. He has a lot more dating/relationship experience than me, from what he's told me, I'd summarize him as a serial monogamist. He tends to jump back into the dating pool rather quickly as that helps him move on. I guess the thought that he might find someone within the next few weeks or earlier kind of bothers me. (As I'm most likely going to be single for awhile after this, as I'd rather focus on other areas of my life than dating.) It shouldn't bother me, especially since my feelings never developed for him anyway, but it does. I'm not sure what that says... does that say that I may not be able to maintain a (strictly platonic) friendship with him? If I do go the friendship route, it will be a few weeks before I make contact. And I know, I know... this isn't something I need to decide now.\n\nI also have a few other (irrational) thoughts floating around that I can't seem to stop, like... what if my social anxiety, depression, low self confidence, etc. is keeping me from really allowing myself to feel connected with a guy? Like I said, I felt like my ex was amazing and if I couldn't develop anything for him, then am I broken? I understand that this is my first relationship, so a lot of this is new to me and I still have a lot to learn... and most likely I'm just going to need time to process everything.\n\nIf you've managed to read all this thank you! I know I wrote a shit ton, and I tried to edit it down and make it shorter, but it's still very long... sorry about that! I will say that I do feel better after getting all that out.   Did you ever feel a spark or never have? I feel like your time frame reached the end of the honeymoon period. And now it's no longer as exciting or passionate and you look at him as more of a friend, even though you do still love and care for him. I figure that's normal for most relationships. The excitement ebbs and flows and the proof of the pudding is when you care enough about to him to stay even when it's more boring. I personally would have stayed and tried to make it work. I would read about the ending of the honeymoon stage to see if this is what happened to me. I would organise dates, road trips, exciting holidays and try and recoup a spark. And only after all that, if my interest in him was not salvageable, would I leave. &gt; Did you ever feel a spark or never have?\n\nI can't say never felt it, but as I mentioned above, it was rare when I did. Also, if I did, I don't think it was for him specifically. I know this is probably going to sound bad but I think I may have been more giddy over the fact that a guy was showing interest in me, wants to spend time with me, etc, particularly in the beginning. (I've never had a guy shown this kind of interest in me before.) And I know I mentioned this above, but I justifed the lack of spark/excitement in the begining to my anxiety. But when I began to get comfortable with him and the anxiety started to subside, I started realizing that the feelings that should be there weren't... I guess because of that, I felt like we never really had a honeymoon stage (from my side anyway). \n\nMy friends have brought up the fact that whenever I talked about us, I have never sounded really excited or happy about the whole thing. I just talked about it matter of factly, and almost 'blah' about it. (Can't think of a word that fits, so 'blah' will have to do.)  And this has always been the case, even from the beginning. \n\n&gt; I personally would have stayed and tried to make it work. I would read about the ending of the honeymoon stage to see if this is what happened to me. I would organise dates, road trips, exciting holidays and try and recoup a spark. And only after all that, if my interest in him was not salvageable, would I leave.\n\nWe almost broke up in Jan, but we decided to give it more time and really give it a try. We took a trip together and tried to get out more. Granted, it's only been a month and half, but I didn't feel anything changing on my side. He was a big part (and constant) of my life for almost a year, so I definitely care very much for him... but the romantic feelings just never developed. I don't think there was ever any (or much) interest to salvage (on my side). I was just hoping (especially after to getting to know him better and realizing how great he was) that something would happen... I was hoping that I would be one of those late bloomers, or whatever you call it. (i.e. instead of love at first sight, it would take time before things started to fall into place and romantic interest starts to form) I guess it depends on what you want in a relationship, and how much you want to be in one. I personally don't think a spark is necessary for a successful relationship. Relationships that begin with high passion can then end when the passion does, and it will. Every relationship will eventually settle into more of a friend based one, and to keep that sustainable there needs to be love, care and affection and a desire for the relationship to last. If you can look at him and honestly say I would be happy with my life if I spent the rest of my life with you, then try and make it work, if you can't, then leave. But either way, I personally don't think there needs to be a spark. Love can and does grow between people who are together and who have mutual goals.",

    "snippet" : "Hey ladies, using a throwaway here, I'm quite embarrassed I feel this way.\n\nI'm 20 and so is my bf. Lately I've been feeling like I'm not adequate enough in the bedroom for him. We've been dating for 2 years give or take, all which have been a long distance. We see each other 3 times a year, but that's not the issue as the distance will end next month.\n\nI've been feeling that way because when we're together, I try to fulfill his and my own sexual needs. This usually results in us having sex twice a day or him receiving oral twice a day. However some days he locks himself up in the bathroom and masturbates, even when we've been active. Because of that I feel like I still don't satisfy him enough and I feel hurt knowing that he's in there thinking about other people to get himself off. Just to be clear I have no issues with him doing that, I'd just rather he does it when he's alone. I've talked to him about this before and he claims that he has a very high sex drive. \n\nAm I wrong to feel like this? If I am how do I get over it? I don't want this to ruin our relationship because besides that everything is great.\n\nThanks for any advice.   Maybe I'm old and square, but I honestly think he's being fucking ridiculous.\n\nHe can't go a few days with \"only\" two orgasms a day? He can't even crank one out in the shower to clear the chamber? No? He simply must masturbate right then because he happens to get horny at that time? He's like a fucking child! I realize he's 20, and 20 is the new 13, but please ask him to exercize a modicum of the self-restraint that he'll sorely need on the off chance he ever becomes an adult. Just jumping up and going off to the bathroom to jack off are the actions of a person who seems regard delayed gratification and self-control as utterly foreign concepts. I'm not going to lie I feel the same way. Roughly 2-4 times a day seems really excessive to me. He claims he doesn't have an addiction but his habits have me wondering if he does. \nOn the flip side, would having high testosterone explain it or would you think its merely just an excuse?  Masturbation isn't the same thing as sex, it satisfies a different urge. You don't know what he's thinking about when he masturbates, so don't worry about it. He might be thinking about nothing! Is he *ejaculating* more than once a day? Because that's a little more interesting. But don't feel down because he masturbates, masturbating is a thing people do with themselves. \n\nBut there's nothing wrong with asking him to not tell you just before he does it, or asking him to do it in private, because you don't need to know every time he decides to whack it.  Thanks for your reply, to answer your question, yes he does. He ejaculates up to 4 times a day. His reasoning is that he has high testosterone and if he jerks off at X hour, then the next day he feels horny again at that time. I'm not sure what to make of that.\n\nI'm not worried about him doing it, its just the mere fact that he goes off when I'm right there. I don't really know how to ask him in a way which he wont think I'm berating him for it.   Would you be willing to give him a bj/hj at those times? Would it make you feel better about it? If so, I'd suggest bringing that up with him.  Honestly, just talk to him. You can't know what he likes and doesn't like if you don't ask him. It seems that he won't be forthcoming with you about it so you have to take the initiative. Tell him what's bothering you and why. He'll understand.  I can see where you're frustrated, but its probably not a big deal, and it probably has nothing to do with how he feels about you. How do you even know he is thinking about other people? \n\nAlso it could just be that he has a routine that he is used to. So even though you guys had sex a few times that day, he still has himself conditioned to get himself off a few times a day as well. I wouldn't read too much in to it though. Maybe he does just have a really high sex drive.\n\nIf you're happy in any other way (in my opinion) this seems like a silly thing to make an issue of. If you feel like you need to say anything at all, maybe  just bring it up lightly, like not in a confrontational way. I wouldn't pick at it though.",

    "title" : "Question for 2X: Why are my bra straps always falling down?",
    "snippet" : "Hi 2X! \n\nI was wondering whether anyone has the same problem as me or, better yet, a solution. My bra straps are ALWAYS falling down onto my arm. \n\nMaybe I have super sloped shoulders, I don't know. All I know is that I'm constantly reaching into my shirt to adjust the bra straps. I've tried making them really loose or really tight, but they just keep falling! \n\nAny advice?  My first tip? Go to r/abrathatfits!!!! You may be in the wrong size bra, and should definitely measure yourself (or have your SO measure you) using the fitting guide in their sidebar.\n\nIf the band is too loose, then the back will ride up, causing the straps to slide down your shoulders. Thank you!! I would never have guessed that the size would affect the straps. I haven't been sized since I was a teenager, so I'll look into a better fitting bra!  Weeeeeell, my first question would be: \"Are the little metal/plastic doohickeys (that the bra straps loop through for adjusting the length) a bit buggered, causing the straps to loosen throughout the day?\" Because if they are, time for a new bra.\n\nAlternatively: \"Are they those cylindrical/fashion straps (very pretty but great at falling down) as opposed to the flat-against-the-skin straps?\" If so, potentially buy bras with differently-styled straps in the future.\n\nQuestion three... \"Does the bra actually fit? When did you last get measured in store somewhere and subsequently buy new bras?\" Whilst this may not be directly connected to slipping straps, everyone should have a well-fitting bra and straps will lose their stretch with age.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that if you always carry your bag on one side then one of your shoulders may be more sloped than the other, with one strap requiring more tightening than its counterpart. (This is my issue!) To add, if it is simply the case that you have very sloped shoulders, have you ever considered something like a [bra clip](http://www.thebraangel.com/#/bra-clips/4541329623)? Designed for things like racerback tops, they will also prevent your straps from slipping down. \n\n(N.b. I have absolutely no affiliation with the linked site - they were simply the first site to pop up in Google when I typed \"bra clip\")  I used to manage a lingerie shop. 9/10 times if this is your problem, you are wearing too large a band size. Try going down 1 or 2 band sizes and up 1 or 2 cup sizes. For example, if you are wearing a 36C, try a 34D or a 32DD. What if your band is too right, but your straps STILL fall down? where does the band sit across your back? A too large band can actually FEEL too tight because it rides up in the back and pinches under your arms. The band should be level all the way around, so in line with your under bust.\n\nIf that's right, I'd try adjusting the shoulder straps. Many bras are more decorative than functional and do not adjust enough, even on the shortest adjustment. Look for a bra with the ability to adjust the whole strap (or most of it). Look for straps that aren't \"slippery\".\n\nIf all else fails and you just have very round shoulders, racer back styles would be a good option. But I've only ever actually met one person in that situation. It's basically always a cheap bra/ bad fit situation, not an anatomy situation. \n\nIf your underwire pokes you or pokes out, that's another good sign you're wearing the wrong size.    I actually did a Google search on this, because I used to have the same issue as you.  This is an informative article that popped up: http://blog.cupidintimates.com/2010/07/22/why-do-bra-straps-fall-down/\n\nIn my case, I think it was because I was wearing the wrong size bra (my band size was too big because I was wearing a bra that was 2 cup sizes too small for me).  But then I got new ones after a fitting, and this doesn't happen to me anymore.\n\nHope this helped somehow.\n\n   ",

He admitted to me that he's been a cheater in the past but claims that he has grown past that and wants to cultivate a healthy and lasting relationship with me. I, too, have cheated in the past and feel the same way towards him and I don't hold the belief that once a cheater, always a cheater. \n\n\nAnyway, today I got curious and made an account on a dating site where I know he has a profile. The site allows you to see the person's last login and according to his profile, he last logged in earlier today.

    "snippet" : "Lately I haven't wanted sex at all.  Not just no sex with my bf, but at all.  Can't even think about David Beckham to get going....just nothing.  And we have still had sex but I'm just not into it.  Couldn't orgasm this time.  I had an orgasm last time but holy shit was it work to get there.  The time before that I didn't have an orgasm either.  And for the few days before that I just gave him a BJ because I wasn't feeling it.  \n\nWTF is going on? No unusually big fights, nothing....I am just a dud.  It's really aggravating bc I know I should want it.  Up until a couple weeks ago we had sex 3-4 xs per week.  Anyone go through these spells?    It could be your birth control (if you're on it). A lot of hormone based birth controls cause a drop in sex drive. You just have to experiment to find the right one. I'm going through this right now too. It royally sucks. If it's not your birth control idk, the other ladies of the subreddit may have more insight  A doctor told me that it could be your hormone levels not just based on birth control, so they issue bloodwork panel. I've never had an IUD but I think it would take time for your body to adjust to what it thinks is a foreign object. Relaxation and having patience is always good, but if it worrysome you should ask your doc.   A lot of things can zap your sex drive, including depression, stress, or a hormonal imbalance.  Definitely worth it to get everything checked out by a doctor, since this could be your body telling you that something is up. I did just start my second semester of my PhD. And I have to get 2 A's to keep my fellowship so a combination of depression and anxiety might be playing a role. I might go to one of the student center's walk in counseling seasons....maybe I need to let off some steam.....",

My birthday was February 1st, and [my boyfriend](http://i.imgur.com/mICzq3S.jpg) of 8 years has been giving me one gift every day since my birthday. Each gift corresponds with a year from my life. For instance, the gift on February 7th was symbolic of things that happened when I was 7 years old. \n\nWhen I was 20 years old, I met a super talented musician, Levi Weaver, as an opening act for an Imogen Heap concert. His music struck a chord for that time in my life, and he and I kept in touch for the next couple years and became friends.\n\nWell, evidently, my boyfriend asked him to [create a song](http://tindeck.com/listen/dndh) for me for February 20th, and this is what he came up with. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. It was so personal and so sweet. I seriously have never had anything nicer done for me in my life. I am so grateful to have such wonderful friends in my life. \n\nThis may not bring as much joy to your life as it did for me, but I hope can enjoy the song for what it is anyway, and I hope you all can find this kind of love someday. :)\n\nhttp://tindeck.com/listen/dndh  This is a beautiful story and you two are a beautiful couple.

    "title" : "What does marriage mean to you?",
    "snippet" : "This is a question specifically addressing marriage, not sex, pre-marital or post.  I have had an evolving understanding of marriage and it's value.  In my social and cultural community, it is regarded as a sacred bond and supposed to give special meaning to a relationship.  However, I've come to realize that all that really matters is love, devotion, and respect for one another in a relationship.  What is the purpose of this label?\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I believe that anyone who wants to get married should absolutely be able to.  But sometimes I wonder if a desire to get married stems more from social acceptance and presenting your relationship in a certain way to other rather than adding meaning to the relationship itself.  I don't know if that makes sense.  But I wanted to hear your thoughts.  Socially, culturally, or personally, how do you approach marriage?  How does it add meaning to your relationship?  Ok I'll be blatantly honest even if its not want people want to hear. I want to marry my SO because I'm almost 30 and I want to call him my husband. I want to have a family with a mom and dad that are husband and wife. To me, because of years of society telling me so, \"husband\" feels like you formally picked each other. It sounds more serious. It sounds like you don't care if the whole world knows you are coupled up. \n\nDeep down I know people who are dating can still be 100% devoted and monogamous. I know that spouses can still cheat/leave. I would still adore my SO without the title, but I want the title. It sounds really good to me. \n\nWe will probably move to that step this year, actually. And we both don't want a wedding. So it's not about the party or the dress. It's about having a husband rather than a boyfriend. It's about sharing a last name and starting a family. \n\nI'm a very independent lady with a professional job and I still feel this way. I don't know what that means.  I'm also a professional with plans to get married later this year, and after hemming and hawing over it for a very long while, I've decided to change my name and use my maiden name as my middle name (just like my mother and grandmother before me).  Now that I've decided, I'm oddly excited about it, and I feel kind of bad for being excited, like this is some regressive thing that I've bought into and I should be ashamed of myself.  Identity is a messy thing, in big and small forms.   Ok I'll be blatantly honest even if its not want people want to hear.

I definitely agree that terms like \"husband\" and \"wife\" are charged with certain qualities of distinctive emotional attachment and elicit strong sentiments.  If it means something special to call your SO \"husband,\" go for it!  My boyfriend and I live 8000 miles away from family. One of my big reasons to want to get married is that if something happens to either one of us that lands us in hospital I want the other to be able to make the decisions that need to be made without the problem of them not being family thus not being able to make medical decisions. If we are married and one of us loses our job there is then a little more security (work visas, insurance, etc). I agree with wrongmetro that the weight behind the words husband and wife from a societal view is advantageous however using the term partner as opposed to boy/girlfriend seems to work just as well. Plus getting married means I get a new special ornament for my Christmas tree (I know it's lame but I document my history on my tree).     I'm currently engaged...I can't wait to call my fiance my husband, because referring to him as my boyfriend simply didn't express what he meant to me. Boyfriend feels too fleeting, and can imply that we've only known each other for 2 weeks or something. I know that's not true...unmarried couples can have the exact same bond that married ones do. But the fact is, I've had quite a few boyfriends, and only one man who I've chosen to spend my life with.       ",

    "snippet" : "I bought her an \"early birthday present\" today and we talked for a while. She realizes that it's treatable and that she could go her entire life without actually getting full-blown cancer. But she also realizes that it will be a constant worry, a constant struggle. She has insurance, but it's not great and finances are a big issue. And she has no idea who she got it from or who else could have it, which is an issue exasperated by the fact that they apparently can't test men for the strain. She's afraid her boyfriend will leave her. And afraid that he'll stay with her just because he doesn't want to give it to anyone else. She also doesn't know how her parents will react and isn't sure how to tell them.\n\nI want to help. I want to give her some idea of what life is going to be like from now on. Knowledge is better than uncertainty, usually. And being prepared always helps. We don't know if she has cancerous or pre-cancerous cells yet, but we'll know in the next week.\n\nSo, twoX, please share any stories or resources you may have. I realize that this may be difficult for some people to talk about, but know your stories, if you want to share, will be valued.\n\nThank you.  Well, for starters, most young people clear HPV spontaneously within two years. So it won't be a lifelong struggle. Secondly, HPV is a fairly benign virus that almost 80% of sexually active people have at some point. I'm thirty two, I've probably contracted a few different strains of HPV by now. I don't know because they don't test for it here. I don't care either because I have my Pap smear every two years which I would do whether I know I have HPV or not, and which is in fact the only thing you can do anyway. Third **the only reason they test for HPV is that some doctors feel it helps them decide whether to further investigate abnormal Pap smears. They don't test for it like they do for other STDs - in order to try and stop it being spread. Mostly because you can't stop it being spread, and you can't treat it.**\n\nThe most helpful way of looking at HPV is that it's about as dangerous as the common cold. Almost everyone will catch it at some point, most people will just get better, *very rarely* someone will have a cold that develops into pneumonia because their immune system is run down or something, and *extremely rarely* someone will die of pneumonia (usually older people). It's actually no more frightening than that - and no-one would be afraid to tell their boyfriend they've got a cold.  You're overlooking a serious issue though. Of the dozens of HPV strains, almost all of them are basically benign (warts aren't exactly pretty, but not harmful either.) But there's a few strains that can lead to cancer. And that's what she has. It's *because* of those strains doctors do pap smears.\n\nComparing it to a cold leading to pneumonia doesn't even really make sense. It's more like if there was a specific cold that often caused pneumonia and you knew you had it.\n\nAlso, I'd you're getting pap smears you'd know if you have HPV or not. It's not a bonus test they do on the side. A pap smear *is* an HPV test. If you've never had an abnormal pap smear, you don't have HPV. And if you have had an abnormal smear, then I really hope it was properly investigated.\n\n You're overlooking a serious issue though.

    "title" : "For Valentine's Day, I got ... sexually assaulted.",
    "snippet" : "Sorry for the wall of text. I just need to get this out.\n\n\nThis past weekend, I went to a convention for work. I was with several other co-workers, including sharing a hotel room with another (female) co-worker. We're all fairly young and around the same ages and we enjoy each others company, so we intended on drinking a bit.\n\nAnyways, on Thursday night I was in my room doing a little bit of work with my roommate (E) comes in with two of our male co-workers, F and G. E and F are engaged and live together. \n\nThe three entered with a 12 pack of beer and said they wanted to play cards, which of course I joined in. We played for a few hours while getting drunk and generally having a good time. I did notice that G (who is married with kids) was getting closer and closer to me, but I planned on ignoring it. He made a few comments about my breasts, but we'd been drinking, so again I ignored it.\n\nWhen it came time to go to bed, F left and went back to his room. G complained that his roommate was a loud sleeper (true) and that he kept the room at 50-something degrees. We agreed he could stay on the couch. I went into the bathroom to pee and get changed, and when I came out he was getting into my bed. I asked him what he was doing and he said, \"I'm keeping my clothes on! And I'm not going to touch you anyways.\"\n\nI've spent many a drunken night sharing a bed with a male friend, so I didn't really think anything of it. However, when I went to get into my bed, he was on my side and wouldn't scoot over. He had his arms out like he wanted to cuddle, and when I sat down he grabbed me in a somewhat-playful way. E noticed that he was being weird, and she called F to come back up and spend the night. We turned out the lights and attempted to go to sleep. I think E and F slept fine.\n\nOnce the lights went out, G kept trying to cuddle with me, spoon me, etc, and I kept scooting away and asking him to stop, as well as getting up and going to the bathroom. We had a couch bed, but there was a door in between that and the bedroom and I was scared he'd follow me in there. After about 30 minutes of this, I figured I could handle him cuddling me if it meant I could sleep. He kept going further.\n\nFirst he was just rubbing my back, then he was rubbing my back underneath my shirt. He moved up to my stomach, but I had crossed my arms over my boobs so he couldn't get to them. After a few unsuccessful tries, he (forcefully, but not violently) moved my arms and felt up my boobs. He asked me if I wanted him to stop and I said \"Yes, I just want to sleep.\" He kept going anyways.\n\nAfter getting to my boobs, he moved his hands downwards. He pulled my pants down several times, and each time I pulled them back up. I was laying on my side and had crossed my legs and was keeping them as tight as possible. He rubbed all over my lower abdomen and my pubic area, then my butt. Eventually he forced his hand in between my legs and started rubbing my labia. I was trying to get him to stop (quietly, without waking the others, who knows why), but he wouldn't. He pulled my pants all the way down, forced my legs open, and put his fingers inside of my vagina. He then proceeded to \"fingerbang\" me, and also put his fingers in my anus. At this point, I had given up fighting (because it hurt) so I just let him get whatever he needed to done, so that I could sleep. Once he had had enough, he stopped and rolled over, so I figured I was good. Everything up to here had taken about 3 hours.\n\nI slept for about an hour, and then I felt his hands on my again. He followed a similar process as before (back, boobs, butt, vagina) but much faster. I could also feel him pressing his penis up against my butt. This time, he decided he wanted to have sex. He was trying to put his penis inside of me, but I put my hand in the way and said, \"No, you don't have a condom.\" I don't know why I thought to say that, but it worked. He rolled over, grabbed my boob, and then masturbated while feeling me up. Not too much longer, my alarm went off, and I got the fuck out of bed.\n\nThe next day, he texted me several times and called twice. E told me that that next evening he had waited in my hotel room for me with E and F hoping that I would come back. Luckily, I was with other coworkers and kind of overstayed my welcome so that I could avoid him. I honestly believe he had bought condoms and genuinely thought I was interested in having sex with him.\n\nI didn't really know what to do about it, but at the urging of friends, I called a supervisor on Monday night and told him about it. He told me I needed to call a different supervisor first thing Tuesday morning. I did so, and was later told that they can't do anything about it because it didn't happen on work property. I would have to file a police report for them to be able to do anything about it.\n\nSince we live 4 hours away from where this happened and it's been almost a week, I don't think it'll help to file the report. There's no physical evidence, so all we have his my word vs his, which is not much help. E and F can contest that he was acting strangely, but also we'd been drinking.\n\nSo, I was sexually assaulted and violated, almost raped, and nothing will happen to him. He wont even know that I complained about him.  I'd tell his wife and ruin his life. No way he should get away with that.    I'm sorry, but if the convention was for work, I would assume you are getting paid for it? If you were, then you were working and it IS your company's business to do something about it. I would also file a police report (maybe it would be easier to file with the state police rather than local police?), but do not let you bosses sweep it under the rug by stating it wasn't their business even if you didn't file the report.  I'm really sorry this happened to you.  The first time I read through your post (I read through it a few times), I was thinking things like \"oh she shouldn't have done that\" or \"I would have said x and y time.\"  Then I felt horrible as I remembered how a couple times semi-similar things had happened to me.  It's so easy to say what the *correct* choice of action was given a cold set of facts retold in a page-long post.  It's hard to explain the weird mixes of fear, guilt, humiliation, shock, etc. that go through your mind in the moment.  A lot of it is also thinking that if you just deal with it for a little while, it'll all go away or they'll stop.  No one should have to deal with crap like that, and I hope you realize it wasn't your fault.  This guy sounds awful.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what kinds of things did G text when he was waiting for you?  Did E&amp;F know what happened?  Do they realize what he did wasn't consensual?  Is G someone you work with, or just someone working for the same company?\n\n*internet hugs*  I'm not sure where you live and whether you're protected by any workers compensation legislation, but if you have sustained any injury from this (including any psychological injury) you may want to considering lodging a claim. \n\nI'm also really sorry this happened to you. :(",

    "title" : "\"A good female design engineer is rarer than a hen's tooth.\"",
    "snippet" : "I am considering accepting an engineering job at a company that overall I like a lot.  However, when I was there for an on-site interview and I was talking to an HR manager about typical boring HR interview questions (\"What kind of people thrive at your company?\" etc), he told me, \"I'm going to tell you the thing I'm not supposed to say.  A good female design engineer is rarer than a hen's tooth.  It's not their fault, it's just the way the industry makes 'em.\"\n\nHe went on to elaborate that female engineers coming out of college go to big companies and become \"systems engineers\", and it's very uncommon to find a really good hardcore female design engineer.  But that of course \"we want female engineers too\" because they have a completely different perspective.  \"I mean, if you sit down with [insert name of some female engineer he knows] and talk to her about a technical problem, she's got all the same hard technical skills as any guy, but she'll come at it from a completely different angle.\"\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen to them during an interview?  I'm unsure if I should be concerned/worried about this...thoughts/advice appreciated.   As a female engineer, this is a common comment.  \nTo be honest, the industry teaches different skills depending on where you work.  Statistically, more engineers become system engineers.  Also, there are more males than females in engineering.\n\nThat being said, most girls go into systems engineering, just like most boys go into system engineering.  Because there are much fewer girls, it is rare to find a good design engineer who is also a girl.\n\nIt is a true statement.  It isn't because girls are worse at it, but because  there are fewer girls.  People need to back off and stop reading into things.  If you throw the sexist card at every comment that could possibly be construed in a negative way, women will never be a prominent face in the industry.  Engineering doesn't have room for that drama. It is a true statement, but the connection between \"it's just the way the industry makes 'em\" and the statement that most *female* engineers go into systems engineering (not  just most engineers out of college go into systems engineering) suggests that he doesn't believe it is based on simple statistics;  that something about being female inherently makes one less likely to be a \"really good hardcore\" design engineer, which is a worrying perspective.   I would be most worried about company culture regarding female engineers after that discussion. The companies that are truly the best about diversity and inclusion have no need whatsoever to talk about it in the manner of that HR rep. I would take a step back and evaluate how everyone at that company interacted with you. He could be a fluke, or he could be a signal that there's some possible culture issues. To me it sounds like they are pretty serious about wanting to bring females onto the team - it's hard to find good design engineers, period. It's even harder to find female design engineers, because there are fewer women in the field, period. I think it's a good sign they are actively trying to bring in women, rather than saying, \"only dudes in our group? oh well!\"    Obligatory \"Oh HELLLLLLLLL NO\" comment . I mean saying \"It's very rare to find an intelligent black person.  It's not their fault, it's just the way their brain makes them\" would get you FIRED.  How is this any different??\n\nNow that that's done...\n\nFirst thing's first: you were talking to an HR manager.  He's in HR.  He has pretty much zero clue what the real needs, requirements, and abilities of the engineers.  All he is doing is inapproriately voicing his own internal sexism to you.  \n\nDon't take it to heart, and don't think that this attitude is reflective of the coworkers you will be around when you are hired.    I don't see where he said that women are stupid. It's asinine to think that men and women don't often have different life experiences and, as a result, have different perspectives.\n\nIt is absolutely nothing like saying black people are stupid.

It may be that that is what he's observed, but you can't simply apply that to every woman who walks in the door.

He went on to elaborate that female engineers coming out of college go to big companies and become \"systems engineers\", and it's very uncommon to find a really good hardcore female design engineer.\"\n\nI read this as women can into \"systems engineering\" jobs without having to go through the drudgery of becoming a \"good hardcore\" engineer, or because they can't hack design engineering.  I will admit that I'm not familiar with the engineering scene, but at the very least he certainly comes off as dismissive towards women.  Even if it is \"the industry's\" fault.\n\n\n&gt; He may not know anything, but he may see the interactions between staff, or be in meetings where the issues and their potential resolutions are put forward.\n\n\nBut as an HR rep, is it really appropriate for him to be commenting on how female engineers are or are not?\n\n\nIn any case, he's making generalizations across an entire gender.  It may be that that is what he's observed, but you can't simply apply that to every woman who walks in the door.  I would be insulted if someone were to make assumptions like that about me.\n\n\n\"I mean, if you sit down with [insert name of some female engineer he knows] and talk to her about a technical problem, she's got all the same hard technical skills as any guy, but she'll come at it from a completely different angle.\"  \n\n\nSure in this case he's being complementary, but he's using one woman as an example to represent all women.  You don't see any problem with this? Sorry, just need to comment.  Systems engineering can be equally hard.  I have done both.  Both have their challenges.  \n\nHe isn't saying women aren't good at design or good enough to design.  He is saying it is hard to find women in design.  Which is true.  It is hard to find women in design.\n\nAnd, every female engineer I have known approaches engineering differently from the males.  Women tend to set out the knowns and the equations first.  We make a plan of attack.  Then we do the problem.\n\nGuys tend to jump in and have a basic plan, but figure most of it out along the way.  These two different styles teach different lessons to the engineer.  The guy that jumped in learns to plan.  The girl that planned learns to back off on over planning to meet deadlines.  \n\nThese stereotypes fit roughly 80% of the engineers I have met over the years.  They are accurate representations of how people act in the workplace.  Women do attack problems differently than men, on a statistical basis.\n\nBut what do I know?  I am some girl on the Internet. Thank you for your engineering insights.  I am not attacking the observations themselves, but rather as they are applied as a generalization.  The problem, as I see it, is that the HR guy is just outright saying \"you're a woman, so 1) you're weird for applying to design engineering and 2) you probably approach problem solving differently than men.\"  \n\n\nHR guy could have instead *asked* \"Here is problem X.  How would you go about solving it?\" or \"what do you feel your design engineering strengths are?\".  Now he is no longer making assumptions, he is in no danger of being offensive, *and* he is assessing OP's abilities/attributes.\n\n\nIt would honestly personally irritate *me* because I tend to fall into that \"male\" category of thinking.  I have better spacial skills than my husband, and when I take those online gender tests or writing analyzers, I usually get identified as \"male\".  I'm not saying stereotypes don't exist for a reason (didn't reddit just have a front page racism-fest yesterday about that?), but you can't just go making sweeping generalizations like that *at an interview*.  It feels pretty borderline inappropriate.\n",

    "title" : "Late 20s and Burnt out.",
    "snippet" : "I wanted to post today, to share with you all, my current state. Mainly because it's something that i can't really shout from the rooftops. \n\n\nI am late 20s, at the point where 30 stops being a scary number starts becoming a state of mind. I have a college degree and a post graduate diploma. Since graduation nearly 6 years ago, i chased for that dream job, which i came close to grabbing it twice. Over a 5 year period i had 23 interviews (with major corporations), culminating in only 3 job offers . I have had 2 long term relationships, back to back spanning 9 years. I have a circle of friends that has become smaller and smaller as the years progress. I have moved address/home 20 odd times in the past 8 years, following happiness, love and career. Oh yeah! and i am mentally and emotionally burnt out.\n\nLife kinda all caught up with me in 2012. It was like a rubber band, which was stretched and stretched. I had started working in a new job and i moved to a new city. I left my boyfriend of 4 years as this was the only job i could find after 24 months of looking. The job did not suit me at all. I hated it and infact i was mislead about the nature of the work but i figured it would help my career progression. I made some new friends with people who were just different to me. These girls were shallow and slutty. I was not. I started drinking more than i ever did before in my life. \n\nMy relationship deteriorated with my partner, or else i just gained perspective from being away. I felt trapped by life and expectations. I had one of those \"is this it?\" moments. Was i only working so that i could get married and have kids? I felt like i wanted to have fun and travel the world. My vocab changed and i started telling my partner i wanted to have adventures. In reality, i think my mind was telling me i needed a break asap. I became disinterested in my hobbies (i had started quilting) all i wanted to do was flake out. I started getting annoyed when my partner wanted me to visit him or when he rang me. Eventually, i emotionally cheated on him and i ended the relationship. The details of this are extremely complicated and i think if i was in a right state of mind it would not have gotten out of hand as much as it did. \n\nAfter i was single, i started going out with my new friends and meeting guys in bars. I started to drink loads before i went out and then i would disappear with a guy i had just met. This was new behaviour for me. I was also going out without a working mobile phone. When i look back on this, i can't answer with clarity as to why i was doing this, i think i was punishing myself by not caring. My only saving grace was that i was not having sex with them.\n\nMy job performance deteriorated or rather, was never any good. I was put on an extended probation. My manager scrutinized my work for 9 months solid. The pressure was immense. I felt like i was in school again and of course under the pressure, i made mistakes. Constantly. This resulted in the first panic attack i had in 2 years, coming on me in work. I left early that day and went to my parents home, 250 miles away. I rested and both my parents were worried. I told them i was fine, i could handle it. I was lying, i wasn't and i couldn't.\n\nIt came to a head before Christmas. My job let me go, and i was elated. I walked away and now i am resting, with my parents. I don't feel like a loser, just someone who worked way too hard. I feel safe and happy for the first time in years. I am financially secured and my mind is quiet. Also my priorities have changed. I am leaving my career and moving in to something entirely different. \n\nBut the downsides; my body is run down, i am fatigued all the time. I have gained a little weight. My parents are not pressuring me to do anything. In fact my mother has told me to just sleep. I am so grateful for this, i honestly feel like i am the luckiest person in the world, because someone has told me that it's ok to ask for help and it's ok to stop.\n\nTLDR: I haven't stopped in years, it came to a head and i am currently recuperating from burnout.  Late 20's: check\nDisenchanted with work: check\nWondering if this is it: check\nPanic attacks: check\nBack home with parents: check\nUnsatisfied with relationships: check\nChubby: check\nSleeps all the time: check\n \nYou and I have much in common, friend. Except since I'm gay, there's significantly less woman to have regrettable sex with or make other equally poor choices with. \n\nI'm back in school discovering new possibilities. \n\nI hope you find what you're looking for.   &gt;I have moved address/home 20 odd times in the past 8 years, following happiness, love and career.\n\nHot damn. That'd kill me. I had a stint of 2 years where I moved 5 times, not across the same city but cross country, different country, etc. I had a lot of fun during that time, but after that I moved into a place where I've been for 3 years so far. It's been hugely beneficial on many aspects of my life, especially mental well-being and relationships. I feel like whenever I moved, I'd have heavy surges of mixed feelings (some positive but many negative) before and after the move. Plus lots of starting over, and I always felt like I was leaving \"just before things got good\" or something. &gt;I have moved address/home 20 odd times in the past 8 years, following happiness, love and career.\n\nHot damn.

Plus lots of starting over, and I always felt like I was leaving \"just before things got good\" or something. The hardest part of it all was that i actually no longer had a space in my parents house to call my own. I was like a tree without roots. This has been amended now. I have bought my first bed ever! to go in to a new bedroom, which i will always own. So at least, no matter where i end up i'll always have somewhere to come home to. Interesting that that was the hardest part for you. With no warning to me the house that I grew up in was repo'd the year I graduated college, and my parents split up and moved away to small apartments in different states. Now my apartment is my home. You get to choose wherever you want to lay your roots. We are similar but different. I think after graduation your first place becomes your home because it is probably the first time you have made a choice to live somewhere you like/can afford so it's exciting. I left home in my second year of college as my folks sold the family home. They moved 100 miles away and set up a new life. So as i was still studying i was staying in various temporary places. Then my folks spilt up and one of my parents moved in to what was my new \"bedroom\". But really i had only slept in it about a dozen times over 2 years. I had stored important mementos from school and my youth in the wardrobe. These items were thrown out. I had no connection to the town or the house. So i figured i'd eventually find solace in setting up the perfect home. Only i did that with both my partners and when those relationships ended i was back to square one with no place to call my own. It is an important step for me to admit that i need to focus on me and my security instead of running away all the time. \n  You aren't alone in this sort of experience.  The poor economy is a major factor in the lives of young people today, with some even referring to themselves as /r/lostgeneration.  I am glad you are now in a safe place.  I hope it's OK for me to offer two suggestions that might help with how you are feeling:\n\n1. Go for a walk everyday, weather permitting.  This isn't a brisk walk on a given course.  It's a walk where you go slow and take time to notice the details of everything around you.  Take time to notice beautiful things.  Try different places often.\n\n2. Consider meditation.  /r/meditation is a small and supportive community if you are interested.  I would recommend mindfulness meditation.  This provides a method whereby you take notice of your thoughts and feelings, acknowledge them, then let them pass.  It provides some wonderful perspective.  Hey, just been through all of that my self. Ended up being diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It felt like a one year long panic attack and the only times I wasen't completely stressed out was when I was drunk which led me to have a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol which led to more anxiety. It's a viscious viscious cycle. In October I was so worn out that I would just cry whenever I was alone (meaning not with people I knew, I cried in public on my commute back from work almost every day). My doctor adviced me to take some time off and I went straight home to my mom and my family. I decided to quit my job and moved here officcially early december. I have a new job now with less stress and I spend as much time as possible with my family, the dogs and outside. The new job pays less and it isn't the career job I used to have and my life is in many ways very boring, but it is the life I need right now. I haven't fully recovered yet but I take one day at a time and try to live more in the moment rather than in the future like I used to. I've almost quit drinking too. \n\nTake one day at the time and allow yourself to heal. Try yoga and meditation and other alternative forms of exercise and therapy. Be around animals if you can. Experience as much fresh air and daylight as you can every day. Eat healthy. Stop making plans. Take a brake from life and just exist for a while. Think about how much you deserve this break.\n\nGood luck with your recovery!  *but it is the life I need right now*\nThis! All the way. I don't think people realize its ok to be in a place you didn't plan on being and that's ok. \" you will live many lives\" is one of my favorite expressions and I love it. You don't have to live the same life year after year and you have the power to change it if you need. I've never heard that expression before but I really like it! I thought for a long time that since I had really good job, was living in the big city with all the urban possibilities - friends, partys, pubs, art galleries, a nice apartment etc. that this was the way I should live eventhough it didn't make me happy. How silly is that!? I think it is quite common for our generation to get burnt out and depressed/anxious/stressed because we have so many possibilities and we set very high standards for ourselves. It's expected that we try our hardest and do our best - but maybe what we really need is just to take one step back and really figure out what we want and need to experience true happiness. Maybe it isn't the jet-set life. Maybe it's the small town, safe job, dog and family kind of life we REALLY want and need. But hey, it is never too late to become who you want to be :)   I'm currently reading this book called Wild by Cheryl Staryed. It's a memoir about her life kind of falling a part to a point where she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert to Oregon over 3 months by herself. \n\nI know when I've felt low in the past I would read a book and it would somehow inspire me. I'm not suggesting you should go hike the trail, but it may inspire you to find something, anything, to rejuvenate you and feel like yourself again. \n\nAlso, it's just a really good book!

Is there any way you can travel overseas for a while? It can be much cheaper than you think. Head on over to /r/travel or /r/solotravel. If you think you might be interested anyway.  Funny enough, after i returned home my father actually booked 2 hoildays for me. I am traveling to the US for the first time in 2 weeks. I am going on a group trip with my father and i am going on a Sailing holiday in June to the Med, with my father and siblings. Also my parents have kindly offered to fund a trip for me to visit my close friend as he is working in Europe. So although it's not a once in a lifetime trip, it's more fun than i've had in a very long time.  Your parents are pure gold.  They really and truly are. I think they've watched me work myself to the bone for years and although they are proud of my achievements, i think they saw that my stresses were unsustainable. Meaning i was getting to the point of no return and possibly self harming.   This post is consumed with work and relationships.  Is there anything you like to do in your free time?  Are you financially secure enough to take a few weeks off to travel and enjoy a completely different change of pace?  It sounds like you need a month of just doing what you want, alone, with the sole intent of recharging.  You may come out on the other end with a better understanding of what you want to do next.

    "snippet" : "I am currently in a Human Sexuality Research course, and very possibly the least creative person EVER.  Contrary to the course name, the project itself isn't research heavy.  We are allowed to write poetry, draw or paint something...whatever we like, so long as we can explain what it has to do with sexuality, and why we found it important.  I do like to create collages, so I was thinking about focusing on female sexuality as portrayed in the media (magazines mostly).  I would really love your input! Thanks!!   I feel like you have a good thing going with a collage. Maybe see how many positive portrayals you can come up with vs negative portrayals.   From googling I found [this](http://www.termpaperwarehouse.com/essay-on/Human-Sexuality-Project-Proposal/97850) and thought it would be neat too. \n\nIf you are comfortable with a collage though, go for it!  I had found that on Google too! I've always been interested in the rumored 'hidden sexual imagery' in Disney movies, but I don't think I'll have enough time to do this project.  Thanks so much for the suggestion!   Collages are so fun, I am incredibly jealous right now.\n\nI like your idea of exploring female sexuality in media, but it's been done tbh. What if you explored the idea of female sexuality in targeted media? Instead of making one collage you could make several. One collage could be female sexuality in men's magazines, female sexuality in women's magazines, cooking magazines, children's magazines, phone books (escort sections are so fun to make collages out of), store flyers and so on. Not only would you get to explore different ideas, perspectives and images in targeted media, but you'd also get to make a bunch of different collages! That's a good idea too. I pitched my idea to my professor and she likes it but says I.need to be a little more specific....so maybe this will work even better. Thank you!",

They don't have the funds for 20 different sized models, and it's probably one of the girls or a friend modelling for them.\n\nThey are also a brand new company with NO income at this time. It's hard to start up with so many different sizes and types, with no money to work with.

Might as well just donate directly to a cause if that's the point. Its not the point, but I think it helps. And considering that we buy bras that cost upwards of fifty dollars which only hold our boobs up I don't think its so against the grain to spend money on good quality underwear that saves waste and helps a cause and would just be all around useful for me.  I only need a couple of good bras; I need at least 20 pairs of underwear. But the point of these is that you wear them only when you need them. Rather than wasting a tampon when you're only spotting at the start or end of your period or during your period with a tampon. You're saving resources and you only need one or two pairs. Its not a necessity but its definitely a good thing.  I think I'll just stick with my DivaCup. Zero waste, and for $25 I have one that will last me for at least as long as my cat doesn't find it and turns it into a chew toy. So far so good since 2007 I read that as, your Diva Cup will last you as long as your cat ... what are you using your cat for? ~*worried face*~ Its not the point, but I think it helps.

I spent $15 on my last bra, and I only have three that fit me right now (one of which is in a different state because I left it at my parents' house by accident). My last pair of underwear cost $3. You must have a really common size or something. I can't find a decent bra in my size for less than $25.     &gt;They'll be some of the most comfy &amp; well-made undies you'll own.\n\nIs anyone else annoyed by words like \"comfy\" \"undies\" and \"super (comfortable)\"?  It sounds so cutesy, diminutive and unprofessional.  Is 'super' 30% more comfy than 'kinda'? I don't want to sound like I'm being contrary or anything because I get what you're saying but I'm wondering what kind of language you prefer them to use. Underwear instead of undies and so on?  It'd be awesome if they could make plus size too. It would open up the market for them. I'd hope they would after being funded. A lot of kickstarter projects start off with a small scope since that is all they can afford. But I agree it would be great if they opened their line up to a wider variety of sizes if/when they get funded.
