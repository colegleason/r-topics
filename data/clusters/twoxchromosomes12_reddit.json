    "snippet" : "I got a bit of a late start figuring out what I want to do with my life. But now I know! And I know I'll be really good at it! I went to school for it. I did an awesome internship. And now I volunteer in the field to get even more experience. But, I've been looking for a legit job for over a year now, and nothing has panned out. 'Discouraged' doesn't even cover what I'm feeling these days. I'm really afraid that it's starting to look bad that I'm applying to the same jobs as young college grads. Interviewers are probably wondering what's wrong with me.\n\nI'm working a shitty minimum wage job to get by, and it is sucking the life out of me. I've started wondering if maybe I should just look for a day-to-day job that doesn't make me regret being born, and try to just do what I love in my spare time. What do you think, ladies? Do I need to face up to reality and accept that this career might not happen?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the encouragement everyone! I'm heading out to a huge rally, hopefully that will also help remind me why I want to do this. =)  &gt; Interviewers are probably wondering what's wrong with me.\n\nHave you tried including a positive explanation in your cover letters along the lines of, \"well I'm starting late, but after x, y, and z learning experiences, I realized that [this activity] is where my passion truly lies, and I'm ready to make a career of it!\" or something similar that presents you being older in a positive light?\n\nAlso, what is the field anyway? Is it possible that there just aren't many jobs in that area right now?\n\nAnd in responce to your last question... do not give up on your dreams. Your situation may suck *for now,* but giving up is a surefire way to have it suck forever. &gt; Interviewers are probably wondering what's wrong with me.\n\nHave you tried including a positive explanation in your cover letters along the lines of, \"well I'm starting late, but after x, y, and z learning experiences, I realized that [this activity] is where my passion truly lies, and I'm ready to make a career of it!\" or something similar that presents you being older in a positive light?\n\nAlso, what is the field anyway?

Your situation may suck *for now,* but giving up is a surefire way to have it suck forever. Thanks for the reply!\n\nThe field is environmental advocacy... not only is it my passion but something that I feel is really important. But yeah, the non-profit world isn't exactly rife with job openings. I'll definitely try to add a short explanation into my cover letters =) Yeah, I think that might help a lot! And also, have you looked at state and city government jobs? Many cities now have sustainability offices that manage environmental initiatives, etc.!    if you are worried that people will wonder about the gaps in your resume or something, you dont' have to have a chronological resume.  There are other types.  Also, I dont think that employers care as much as you think - they understand that people have gaps in their resume for various reasons - maybe they got off to a late start because they were seriously ill, were traveling, were a stay at home parent, decided to make a career change etc.  \n\nIt looks like you are already doing all the right things to get a job.  Volunteering to get experience is one of teh best things to do!  If you are concerned, work on really crafting your resume and cover letter to uber perfection.  And dont rule out taking a secretary job just to get your foot in the door of a good company that might have a position for you later Can you elaborate a bit more about the alternative formats of resumes that you mentioned in your first two sentences? I have too frequently been interrogated by potential employers as to why, precisely, I didn't work for specific periods of time, despite having what I consider to be a fairly good resume. It's something that always makes me anxious about interviews. the three main types of [resumes](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/resumes/p/resumetypes.htm) are  Chronological, Functional, Combination, Targeted.  There's some info in the link i provided. Ask me if you need anymore info.\n\nI didn't know interviewers would havethe nerve to interrogate you like that.  I dont advocate lying but since this is about your livelihood - I think that if they ask you could probably say that you spread out your college education over many years so that you could work and travel etc.  I think that's a pretty harmless lie the three main types of [resumes](http://jobsearch.about.com/od/resumes/p/resumetypes.htm) are  Chronological, Functional, Combination, Targeted.

I will SO use this in the future!\n\nSomething personal and very awful (as in, two people I've told about it got tears in their eyes) happened to me and during the second year of upper secondary school I became severly depressed. My school work suffered and I graduated 6 months later than the other kids. I also missed out on the thinking of what I wanted do and spent 2 years taking one course here and another there, working part time and just getting back to normal. \n\nNow I'm both certain that this reflects badly on me and afraid that I will get a question on what happened there. You advice is likely to save me from this! Super thank you to you! Can you elaborate a bit more about the alternative formats of resumes that you mentioned in your first two sentences? I have too frequently been interrogated by potential employers as to why, precisely, I didn't work for specific periods of time, despite having what I consider to be a fairly good resume. It's something that always makes me anxious about interviews. Interviewers will always ask you about gaps in your employment history because they are red flags (i.e. fired from a job not included in your resume, etc). Just be sure you have a good and honest explanation for each of those gaps (i.e. went back to school, cared for sick member of family, husband transferred so we moved out of state, volunteered full-time, self-employment, etc). Also, interviewers will always ask you why you left one job and started another job--again, this is a potential red flag. Have a good explanation for that as well, and NEVER throw your former boss/company under the bus with an interviewer--even if he/she/it was the king of all dipshits everywhere.\n\nIt's all about spin.

Its tough, though... I reached out to a few people in the field to critique my resume, and I got back completely contradictory suggestions. I think every employer likes different formats =p I actually just recently overhauled my resume to be non-chronological, and I think its better. Its tough, though... I reached out to a few people in the field to critique my resume, and I got back completely contradictory suggestions. I think every employer likes different formats =p  I am 40.   I finally realized you should work to live, not live to work.   Find a job you LOVE.  Forget the rat race.  Don't be a wage slave.   The only thing that really matters in life is TIME and how you use it.  Don't waste it dragging yourself to a job you dread day after day.\n\nI have a college degree right after high school.  I found it unfulfilling. So at age 38 I went to nursing school and now have my nursing license.    There were so many people my age who wanted a new career.  It's never too late to decide to switch you a career you love!   \n\nYou may also find some fulfillment (and maybe even some career-based experience) in finding a cause you love and/or doing volunteer work.   Perhaps after doing some service work you'll have a better idea of a job you love? \n\nI also discovered that unhappiness in career is related to unhappiness to life in general.  It might be time to \"find yourself\".   Re-evaluate your goals and beliefs.   Are your emotional and spiritual needs being met?     For example, I've discovered that I wasn't happy with my own life. I talked to many people, did reading, and did self exploration.   In my case, I found meditation and [taoism](http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism) very helpful in feeling more satisfied and balanced in my life in general.   My path may not be quite right for you, but my point is that your uncertainty in your career may be related to bigger issues.    You are never out of luck. I know that sounds utterly trite or perhaps overly optimistic, but god, you've got your life ahead of you. I've been in similar positions--working shitty jobs to get by, struggling to make gains in what I'm passionate about. My deepest advice is to get out of the job that's \"sucking the life\" out of you. Whatever it is, it isn't worth it. I'm not saying to quit without a backup plan and freefall, hoping to land the perfect job of your dreams. It sounds like you're already in the process of applying to other positions, so keep at it. I know the feeling of utter discouragement and pessimism you're feeling. And honestly? I'm not where I want to be yet either. You can work toward it though. And taking healthy steps to make yourself happier along the way is one way to rid yourself of the fear and feelings of failure you might be experiencing now.\n\nBest of luck to you in your endeavors. Don't give up.       In my experience, getting jobs is all about knowing people. Volunteer for organizations, get involved with campaigns ... you'll gain valuable experience and show people you're capable. Then when jobs come open you'll be first in line.\n\nIt's a tough economy but stick with it and you'll be fine. I started late too. Now I'm launching my second career. It's worth it in the end!\n\nAre you going to the Keystone rally in DC? Cuz so am I!   i think you can do whatever you want, whenever you want as long as you're creative about it and you just own it. I'm 28 and spent the last 5 years in a good office job as an assistant in advertising sales. it's not challenging and I don't want to stay in advertising. I spent the first year frustrated and the next 4 exploring all kinds of life and personal goals. last year i decided to work on a career so now I'm studying for the GRE  and about a year ago i had an idea for a website and started doing it. i know NOTHING about programming or websites but it started as a hobby and now it may grow into something big. just keep doing what u love and the universe will reward you for it.

    "snippet" : "Ladies, I was the only daughter of a wonderful woman. My two boys and I were her world. She died. And I'm so lost without her. We were best friends/enemies..and all that goes with being an only child to a mom who was brave enough to raise a daughter on her own...and to watch her own daughter raise two boys on her own. I just want someone to know that Sharon White-Sanchez...was a wonderful woman. I don't want the world to forget her. Becasue I can't. Thank you ladies.Sincerely. It's been so hard without her. She was so beautiful. She taught me to be all I am. An educated woman, who takes pride in her children, herself...and is not afraid to be goofy. :) Please hug your mom if she's still on this earth. They fret, they worry and can be hard on us...but they love us.Please don't forget how much they do...even when it's hard to recognize. When they leave...there is no one who can replace them. Mom I love you.  Your mom sounds like a great woman. I know she is dearly missed. \n\nOP, it's more than acceptable to seek some help while you go through this. There are free support groups for grieving and loss that I really urge you to look into. \n Thank you hun. I'm afraid to talk to anyone at the moment, it's been awhile but i still think I might be in denial. I've been talking about it for quite some time almost like it happened to someone else. Just recently have I started admitting it happened...not just in words..but..(this may sound stupid)..but it feeels like it's real now. Again this may sound stupid, but i moved home.(other side of the country)...looking for her? Now that I've been here for some time, i realise..she's not coming back. Grief is a very unique process for everyone and every situation. People like to tell us there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to grieve, especially when you've lost someone close to you. There isn't. All that matters is that you are working toward healing, and not letting go of other things that are important. If the grief is getting in the way of your work or taking care of your kids, that's a sign to seek help. If you find yourself stuck and dwelling on it and never feeling any better, you may find that talking to a grief counselor can help.  Please realize I've said \"healing\", and not \"getting over it\"! Healing is a long process with no real end, but it means remembering your mom and being happy you had her, feeling lucky she was in your life, and smiling at happy memories, rather than just being sad (but being sad is always okay!) For lots of people it's the \"Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened\" sort of idea.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry it's been hard on you. Take care of yourself.  Thank you hun. I'm afraid to talk to anyone at the moment, it's been awhile but i still think I might be in denial.

I empathize so much with what you're saying. My mother died when I was nine and it's the story of my life. I'm a functional, happy adult and still wrecked inside about it. I've talked to women whose mothers died when they were in their seventies and they were wrecked. So my point is that when your mom dies, it fucks you up, period.\n\nI don't know if this is the least bit of help but I keep it handy. All that love your mom gave you--every drop--you will have forever. You can never lose it, and no one can take it away from you.\n\nAnd to the rest of you bitches, call your mom.  I will raise my glass to Sharon White-Sanchez tonight, a good woman I never got to meet. And I'm going to go hug my mum, who luckily is just upstairs.\nI am sorry for your loss. I will raise my glass to Sharon White-Sanchez tonight, a good woman I never got to meet. And I'm going to go hug my mum, who luckily is just upstairs.\nI am sorry for your loss.  I never met your mom, but I know what it's like to lose the one person who was all that mattered.\n\nA little over 15 months ago, my brother died and there has been nothing but shock, sadness, and depression. I don't want to stop grieving because I fear that I'll forget him, but I also know that the depression brought on by the loss of him has been affecting my life. \n\nJust a few weeks ago I started counseling and while I still have a way to go, it's definitely helped and I found that I just want to talk about him sometimes - something I can't do without making other people cringe.\n\nYou mom will never be forgotten and she'll live on through you and your kids. I wish I could give you some ideas. Everyone tells me to write letters to him but I find that more depressing than anything else. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. It sounds like she was truly loved. How about writing to yourself? You said you still want to talk about him, but don't have anyone to talk to. I've found this useful myself:)\nI'm sorry for your loss, I can't imagine how upset I would be if I lost my brother:(           So sorry for your loss.  I can understand how deep of a pain you are feeling.  I lost my mom almost 12 years ago and I still well up with tears very easily when I talk about her or when someone brings her up but I think it's important to her memory and to the grieving process to keep talking about her.  Keep those memories of her alive, as cheesy as that sounds.  You will always miss your mom and you will always grieve her but it will get easier.  And as time goes on, you'll find yourself doing things or saying things and go \"wow, that's something mom would do\" or you'll notice that your sons will have some resemblance to her, whether it be physical, a mannerism or a personality trait.  You'll see her in strangers on the street and in women you meet in the grocery store.  They'll have her smile or her laugh and for a moment you will think it's her.  In some ways it is.  These little reminders of her everywhere will ensure that she's never forgotten and serve to show you she's still a part of your life and loves you very much.  HUGS!!         ",

At the time I couldn't understand how she could even think to stay with him. It was only later, when I learned more about patterns of abuse that I realized how hard it is for someone to break that cycle and the pure psychological distortion that an abusive person can inflict on your mind. \n\nA lot of people don't understand just how difficult it is to break free from an abusive relationship. \nAnd after reading too much misogynistic crap on reddit today, I feel like I want to do so much more than just say \"congratulations\" to you for breaking free. \n\nI want to hug you, and say thank you for reminding me that people are still breaking the cycle every day. :)\n\nYou should be so, so proud of yourself.

    "title" : "I feel like I was mistreated by my medical practitioner, and I could use a little insight from others!",
    "snippet" : "I am a sexually active female, twenty-two years old. I recently had an annual appointment at my family doctor's office with the nurse practitioner, another female who is significantly older than myself. I went in for a general checkup and a yearly pap smear. At this appointment, I also decided that I wanted to have myself tested for STDs, simply because I like to practice responsible, safe sex. I was asked the typical question, \"How many sexual partners have you had, above or below five?\" I have had above five sexual partners and responded honestly. I did not give her an exact number. Upon saying this, I received an extremely stern (almost disapproving) look, and she proceeded to condescendingly inform me that \"the more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract STDs.\"\n\nThe entire appointment was incredibly uncomfortable and I felt that she asked me questions that did not pertain to anything medically. For instance, as she was listening to my lungs, she asked me if I had any other tattoos that she \"should know about.\" I have a small tattoo on my foot and one of the inside of my arm. I was very confused by this question, because I did't understand how it was relevant in any way. It just seemed strange.\n\nJump to a few weeks later and I wake up with a voicemail from her letting me know that there are some abnormal cells on my pap smear, apparently related to a high-risk strain of HPV. She doesn't provide me with any other information, only that the abnormal cells might be linked to cervical cancer. I am incredibly distraught by this, until I do some research of my own and discover that this is actually pretty common. \n\nA week later, I receive a call from her while I'm at work. She informs me this time that I have \"herpes\" and that I need to come in immediately to treat myself and learn how to protect my partner. She does not specify which type of herpes I have. I assume it's genital herpes and tell my boyfriend the same night about my situation. He's incredibly supportive and I convince myself for the next two weeks that I'm going to have to live with this for the rest of my life. When I finally see my doctor (not the nurse practitioner), to my surprise, I learn that it's oral herpes, not genital herpes. At this point I feel simultaneously relieved and upset.\n\nI guess the end result is.. I feel very mistreated. I feel like I was lead to believe that I had to deal with some very serious medical conditions, when in fact both situations were nothing to worry about. In a way, I feel like she was trying to punish me for my life style. For being a young, sexually active woman. For having tattoos. I feel like she chose to relay all of this information to me in a way that would scare me. It seems very unprofessional and I'm just straight up angry that I was worried and distraught unnecessarily for almost two months.\n\nAm I overreacting or unjustified in feeling this way? I'd love to hear what any of you have to say about this.\n\nEDIT: I'm also upset because not only was I lead to believe that I had real cause to worry, but the whole herpes bit could have potentially jeopardized my relationship. Luckily my boyfriend is effin' awesome, but some other men might not have been as understanding!  I think this doctor isn't a good match for you, but I'm not sure she isn't a good doctor.\n\n&gt;she proceeded to condescendingly inform me that \"the more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract STDs.\"\n\nI think this is hard to say non-judgmentally, but it is also true.  Doctors are in a strange position with this one, some people take the stance \"I use condoms, my partners aren't drug addicts, I'm fine!\" but more sexual partners does statistically increase your risks.  \n\nRe: the tattoo question.  I think that might have been a hepatitis question, assuming she asked how long you've had them.  \n\nBoth the HPV and herpes issues she should have given you more thorough information.  She also should have made it clear that she was open to questions.\n\nI'm sorry you had such a bad experience and I think you should find a new doctor.   But I think this is more a mismatch than file a complaint kind of bad.\n Sorry, but I just feel the need to clarify: she did not ask me for how long I had had my tattoos. She noticed the tattoos on my foot and my arm (both of them are relatively visible) and asked me if there were \"any others [she] should know about.\" I realize that perhaps there was a perfectly valid reason for asking me this (i.e. hepatitis), but at the time it seemed odd.

I think she could legitimately be asking because she wanted to look at them for signs of infection.   They actually ask because they need to document any new tattoos as you are not supposed to give blood a 1-3 years after getting them.  A GP wouldn't have to know that though.  If it were a blood bank, then yes, but they don't usually communicate with the blood giver's doctors.

Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with the questions she asked/from what you've said, she doesn't seem to have been unprofessionally intrusive - she may have asked about the tattoos because of the risk of hep from employees who aren't diligent about using a clean needle every time.\n\nThat said, I would say the way she told you about the possible herpes or unusual cells is totally unprofessional and not OK. I agree that everything she said to me was well-within her purview as a medical professional, but her delivery was not appropriate. I honestly felt like I was being interrogated, and I didn't appreciate the dirty look I was given when I informed her that I had \"above\" five sexual partners. I have never been made to feel uncomfortable by any other medical practitioner, male or female, ever. It felt like a form of unwarranted, subtle slut-shaming.

If you didn't click with her, regardless of whether her questions are legitimate, you have a right to choose not to go to her in the future. (I was reminded of this at a PP office recently when I had to find a new OB/Gyn office in a new location.)\n\nIt sounds like a doctor's office with one (or more) doctor(s) and one or more NPs, so you should be able to move around within the office without having to find an entirely new practice. Next time you make an appointment, request that it be with someone other than her. You shouldn't feel uncomfortable with your provider, you need to feel like you can go to them with any health question.    [deleted] I know we support sisters here, but remember HPV increases cancer risk and HSV1 can be oral or genital and increases the risk of contracting HIV (if exposed), so while bedside manners matter, the viral situations can take a serious turn.

Didn't know with who I could share that so I thought that this would be a great place :)\n\nThough I wouldn't say that I ever had a real ED, I definitely had a problem with food and self-esteem. At my worse, I had lost my period, was very underweight, and couldn't find clothes that would fit me in regular stores so I had to sew to get them to my size. \nBut these last months, I've started to feel better about myself in general, which includes my weight. I stopped to count the calories in every food I eat, and I even had pizza this week ! And yersterday my period came back, and though I'm still annoyed by having it as much as I was before, I've never been so happy to see them! \n\nAnd today I picked up denim shorts in my closet without really looking at it, and when I tried it it was so tight that I couldn't take it off. So intead of cry and loathe myself like I would have done it before, I just cut all of the little strings I had put on it what seems such a long time ago, and felt amazing about it. These shorts looked like a little girl's, and now they look like a woman's ! So though they're still a bit too large, instead of adapting it to my current size or buy some new, I'll just keep them until I can fulfill them. And I can't actually wait to gain this weight, so yay recovery !\nI'm finally feeling great about myself, I can now look in a mirror and think that I'm pretty, and that my arms are fine, my legs are fine, and so is my belly. And that I'd look great with just a few more kg! And now that I actually like myself, physically as well as a person, everything around me seems to get better. People like me and I've made very good friends, I go out and enjoy it, and I've started to draw again! :)  This is awesome to hear - congratulations! Yay recovery! \n\nIf/when you are ready to take it to the next level, maybe you could check out some of the food subreddits to try to get ideas for awesome and delicious foods you can try and now truly enjoy - there's r/cooking, r/nutrition, and probably others! If you want to try to gain some muscle mass, you can check out r/xxfitness. I think there are a lot of women there who just want to feel healthy and confident in their bodies, it's a great community.\n\nAlso, maybe not for now, but maybe once you have your denim shorts awesomely filled out, you could try using a smartphone app like myfitnesspal to set weight GAIN goals - based on your size, height, age, etc. it will calculate how much you should be eating to gain a couple kgs. :)  Anywho, congrats again, and keep up the good work! Thanks for the advice, i'll check it out ! It's so nice of you to have cared enough to help :p  This made me so happy. Congrats!  Hey congrats! That's great to hear. Good mind, healthy body. Keep it up! sending you some hugs and high fives!   I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!    ",

    "snippet" : "I apologize if this isn't the right sub. I just figured since this was an really active sub, there might be someone else who has experienced this. \n\nI'm looking to get an IUD (probably Paraguard) when my insurance kicks in March 1. The problem is that I've had a large ovarian cyst that was never removed. This was due to a lapse of medical coverage, but when I was enrolled in college last semester, I visited the OB-GYN on campus and she said that there were no cysts present. However, I am without insurance again, and over the last week I've had symptoms that are similar to the ones I had when I first discovered the cyst leading me to believe I *might* have another one. \n\nI plan on getting this checked out the second my insurance kicks in, but I'm still concerned about getting an IUD after having a history of ovarian cysts. I keep getting conflicting information online about it. A few sources say that IUD's- at least Mirena - can increase the potential for cysts. Other sources, and my original OB-GYN, stated that hormonal birth control can lower the instances of cysts. I'm very concerned that the IUD will increase my chance of having a cyst. I had a very bad experience with oral birth control (particularly remembering to take pills and severe nausea). I'm not opposed to sterilization, although my insurance doesn't 100% cover that.\n\n**My question: Will an IUD lower or increase my chances of having a cyst? Have any of you opted for an IUD after having an ovarian cyst in the past? Has anyone gotten a cyst after installing an IUD?**\n\nThank you for your patience in reading this, and any input!     ",

For a while I was self conscious about it if I was sleeping with a guy, but it doesn't really bother me now. Glad you're fine now!

It was January 2012. I'm completely fine now, just an ugly scar. For a while I was self conscious about it if I was sleeping with a guy, but it doesn't really bother me now.  I have not, but David Sedaris has an [essay](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/29/041129fa_fact1) about what sounds like such a cyst. I hope you find it amusing if you have not read it.   I have! I was 17 and had an emergency surgery to remove it, as it had gone septic. Some people catch them sooner.  I still have the scar but it's never reoccurred in the past 17 years.  The worst part is the recovery process-packing and unpacking the wound is pretty painful.  It took about 6 werks to totally heal. Yeah, I had the surgery once already, and mine is draining which is making me debate having it done again :/\n If it's recurring they may have to use a salt-the-earth strategy and just remove all the tissue in the surrounding area. Your butt crack will look a little weird for awhile but the cyst and ickiness will be gone. They did that the first time. I had an open sore for four months :/ Yeah, I had the surgery once already, and mine is draining which is making me debate having it done again :/\n     I had a really bad one. I had lower back pain for probably a month before I finally went to the hospital because I was on the verge of passing out from the pain. I was uninsured so I relied on whatever the county would provide as far as free health care. It was lanced and honestly I don't remember if I was given antibiotics or not. It felt better for a while, and I went to the county indigent doctor for a check up about a month later. He immedeatley admitted me into the hospital for emergency surgery. It was so whirlwind I am not sure why, but I think the infection had gotten really bad. I was in the hospital for several days. They did not do a great job of sewing it up and the stitches did move and tear some during healing. My skin had also grown around the stitches during healing so when they took it out it ripped the skin even more. Yeah, with county health care where I lived at the time, they don't treat you all that well. \n\nSo now I have a huge ugly scar. I mean ugly. The only way I can describe it is to say that it has..flaps? they are small but still. You can also see all the dots from where the stitches were. I have always been super self conscious about it. \n\nAs far as the embarrassment with sexual partners that was mentioned below, I used to have it a whole whole lot. Now I don't care. Most of the time when they see it or feel it or are about to I just mention a quip about my hack job surgery and most of them don't care or let on that they do. \n\nIf you are really afraid of it getting worse, get it taken care of before it does. Talk to your doc and see what the best course of action. You might even want to see another doc who is willing to try a different approach other than packing.",

    "title" : "Advice on sexual coercion?",
    "snippet" : "The first time I was ever physically close to a guy resulted in a make out session. He kept asking for sex and I repeatedly said no until I finally said yes. I made him stop when he started hurting me (no actual penetration, but close), and ever since I've felt powerful feelings of shame, guilt, and lust towards him. I'm angry at the way he persisted and physically hurt me, but I still want him very badly. It's so conflicting and distracting, I don't know what to do.  Talk to him and tell him that he made you feel uncomfortable, and tell him that you want to do things but you want to go slowly. If he doesn't respect your wishes, he's not worth it. I disagree, he's proven himself not to respect boundaries already. If you talk to him, he may use the opportunity to manipulate you. He sounds dangerous, stay well clear of him.\n\nSexual coercion can bring up really complicated emotions. If you want, I think it would be a good idea to talk through the feelings you're having, with a counselling service if there's one available,  or with http://www.rainn.org 1.800.656.HOPE (US) or http://www.rapecrisis.org.uk/ 0808 802 9999 (UK). &gt; He sounds dangerous, stay well clear of him.\n\nIsn't that a bit over the top?  He did stop, prior to penetration, when he saw that she really didn't want to do it.  If his intention was to rape her, I feel like he would have.  I think just talking about it might actually resolve the issue.  Of course, the choice is completely OP's. I don't know the exact situation; like everyone here I can only guess at an interpretation. But the OP describes this as sexual coercion, so it sounds like the situation was very unpleasant and worse than just a simple miscommunication. There are people out there who wouldn't forcibly rape someone, but would still ignore their sexual wishes, by nagging or manipulation or pushing them further than they're comfortable with, and if you end up in a relationship with someone like that it can be extremely damaging. Personally I would take his behavior on this very first make-out session to be a worrying sign.   Make it clear that when you say no, you mean it.  I would say drop someone who doesn't respect your boundaries, but the fact that he did ultimately stop prior to penetration, when you made your discomfort known, gives me some hope for this guy.\n\nFull disclosure: I don't really subscribe to this nagging = sexual coercion idea, TBH.  I know that wont be a popular sentiment on this board, but I think it's very fact specific.  So long as you don't feel threatened and you have the ability to put a stop to the nagging in some other way (like getting up and leaving), then I feel like the choice is still ultimately yours.  So I don't consider it non-consensual in those circumstances.  If he's nagging you in an intimidating way and you feel trapped and helpless, then that could be a different story. Nagging until a yes is reluctantly given /= enthusiastic consent Right, but it's still consent so long as the choice is ultimately yours and you weren't consenting under threats or duress.  \n\n\"Enthusiastic consent\" is not a legal standard.  Is any attempt to negotiate sex in a relationship considered \"coercion\" in your view? Coercion may be a really harsh term to use, but that's how it played out for me. He made me feel like I was doing something wrong when I didn't say yes. I just don't now how to handle the emotions I'm feeling now. I appreciate your viewpoint, and I honestly don't believe he's an awful person, but I'm confused as to what to do with my own shame and lust.",

Nothing deep - just right inside my vagina, perhaps an inch deep at the most. It kinda is a burn-y feeling, not horrible but not, like I said, quite right. There's no smell, a tiny amount of discharge, and I think that my urine smells different. I've had the same partner for years and never experienced this feeling before. We've both been tested, no STDS. Maybe I should also mention that I am 100% not pregnant and on the pill, with monthly periods.\n\nI have taken medication for a UTI, for a yeast infection (which my doctor later told me the test results were negative for), and now bacterial vaginitis, which I'm not sure is working. Feeling pretty defeated and confused. I don't think it's all in my head, but I just don't know what this is...has anyone experienced this feeling before?? \n\ntl;dr: After years of pain-free sex, penetration suddenly hurts, tried lots of meds, nothing has worked (so far!), why why why?  could be secondary vaginismus or secondary vestibulitis due to the bc. It happens sometimes. Just throwing out ideas. I think vestibulitis is the more likely of the two, considering the connection with you taking bc and it being a shallow burning feeling.  It does sound exactly like what I had when I had vestibulitis. \n\nHas the OP recently started taking the pill?  No, I've been taken the same pill, Orthro Tri-Cycln Low for about four years. It does sound exactly like what I had when I had vestibulitis. \n\nHas the OP recently started taking the pill?  But if I do have vestibulitis, how tough is it to get rid of? pretty tough, especially since we know so little about it. I still have it 6 months after being diagnosed, and it's probably not going away anytime soon unless I start doing physical therapy regularly. But I have primary vestibulitis- if yours is the kind caused by bc, it could be that you just need to switch methods and do the treatment for vestibulitis and you'll be as right as rain. \nWhen you go to a doctor again, you've got to suggest it again I think, since it's so understudied that most doctors don't realize that could be what you have unless you plant the seed in their mind.  Man, I keep making the mistake of thinking Gen Y's are much better off in the sexual health department so its really sad to hear that nothing has changed since I had vestibulitis in the 1990's. I had it for about five years and was given a numbing hemorrhoid cream to use during/after sex with pretty good results (I only used if afterwards because the smell and taste weren't the best). Surely there are better numbing options now?\n\nI saw from a quick search that people with vestibulitis claim that physical therapy is giving the best results. What kind of therapy do they do exactly? Since mine resolved completely with pregnancy and childbirth, it does make sense there could be muscle or neural causes (a 'caught' nerve gets less blood supply which makes it 'complain') and I could see how massage could be helpful for all of that. Lots of it. With a good partner this could be therapeutic sexy times.\n\nAlso, as was suggested elsewhere, it is worth trying different positions as 'missionary' made the burning much more likely for me, too.\n\nGood luck, OP. Crossing my fingers that you all find answers.\n\n could be secondary vaginismus or secondary vestibulitis due to the bc. It happens sometimes. Just throwing out ideas.

Also, sorry for the throwaway... while I doubt my friends stalk me, they definitely know my real account. \n\nSo last night my friends and I were waiting in the very crowded downtown area of our collegetown. A cab came up, and my two girlfriends went for the same cab as a handful of guys; the cab driver recognized one of the guys -- we'll call him Tom -- and said his dispatcher definitely said he was going for Tom. Fine, no problem, I don't get in the cab.\n\nTom tells my two girlfriends that we can share the cab, so they get in. At this point I'm getting in, and Tom's friend, we'll call him John, grabs me by the hips to stop me from getting in the cab and starts screaming that the cab driver said it was Tom's cab, while hitting my chest/shoving me so hard that I literally fell back. Worth mentioning, I'm not exactly small at 5'7\"/140 lbs... I'm already very much outside/away from the cab and he shoves me again telling me to get the fuck away from the cab. \n\nEveryone is drunk at this point, but his friends are telling him to back off and I'm screaming that he can't fucking touch me, it was his friends that agreed to share and that there are cops *literally* at the end of the block  (as there always is after last call). \n\nI scream to my friends that I want to talk to the cops -- if anything, they can help me *feel* better and get us home, even if they can't do anything about it legally. But not only do my friends not get out of the cab (and you can sure as hell believe I'm not going anywhere near it again), but they laugh at me and call me dramatic for crying. \n\nAt this point, another cab is waiting and we ask where he's going/if he was waiting for us and he told me that he saw the whole altercation and he'll take us wherever we want to go -- regardless of who he was technically sent for. He also told me that he'd wait if I wanted to talk to the police, and that he'd be a witness if I needed it. My friends are still laughing. \n\nWhen we get to my apartment, my friends got out first and the cab driver was like, \"Hey, this is totally not intended to be flirtatious or even a little bit uncomfortable, but if you *do* decide to do something about that guy, here's my name and number because I really will be a witness, especially since your friends aren't being very helpful or understanding.\" \n\nI went back in my room and cried for like ~20 minutes when I decided I wouldn't be able to sleep unless I said something; so I went in and I was like, just so you guys know, I was really upset because that guy laid a hand on me, and the fact that you guys joked about it and didn't take it to seriously really hurt. \n\nMy roommate didn't respond -- somehow she fell asleep in the 2 minutes between small talk and confrontation. And the other girl, who I'm considerably less close to, just said, \"I honestly didn't even see it happen, so I didn't realize how upset you were.\" Oh, okay... I guess my crying was no indication. \n\nWhat should I do, TwoX? I know this kid's first name, and I know some of the people he was with, so I can easily figure out his name if I want to do anything legally I guess. I just don't know if there's even any real grounds. My main concern is with my friends -- should I confront them sober? Or just let it and excuse their behavior for being drunk?  Take the cabbie up on his offer. Report the incident to the police. \n\nYour friends were probably too drunk to realize you were seriously assaulted. At least that's what I'm going to charitably assume, and give them the benefit of doubt.\n\nIf they react poorly to finding out you've reported the assault to the police, that's another matter. They should be concerned, sympathetic, and supportive. I agree.\n\nI would also suggest not to go out with said friends again if they are going to be drinking, as they are obviously a hazard to you since they get drunk to the point of being oblivious. but that's just my opinion... I definitely agree with this. If you are going to be drinking, its best to do it with people you trust. Take the cabbie up on his offer. Report the incident to the police. \n\nYour friends were probably too drunk to realize you were seriously assaulted.

[deleted] &gt;At this point I'm getting in, and Tom's friend, we'll call him John, grabs me by the hips to stop me from getting in the cab and starts screaming that the cab driver said it was Tom's cab, while hitting my chest/shoving me so hard that I literally fell back. \n\nGrabbed and hit in the chest. Something that the cabbie, who's probably seen more than his fair share of drunken stupidity in action, thought was serious enough that he gave her his card and indicated a willingness to back her up. \n\nHow serious an assault does it have to be before it gets reported? [deleted] \"Hit\" as in \"hit.\"\n\nIt seems we have a difference of opinion. Imagine that! It's not opinion, it's a matter of interpretation. If he actually hit her chest, as in punch or a open handed strike, then of course I agree it is a serious assault. \n\nPersonally I doubt that's the case. Seems to me like she's just saying that he pushed her chest. She doesn't mention being physically hurt. When a guy does that to a girl's chest, more happens then simply just falling back.  The main reason why I believe that this was serious enough to report was the cabbie's reaction. Like I said before, cab drivers see *a lot* of drunken stupidity. If what the guy did was serious enough that the cabbie handed over his card and offered to be a witness, I think it's fairly safe to say that it was more than just a little bit of drunken pulling and pushing.  [deleted] Just because she doesn't mention being hurt doesn't mean she wasn't. \n\nAnyways, cabbies are not exactly known of being fond of the cops. They won't call the cops if they don't have to. And they certainly don't want to lose the time they could be using to make money, testifying on behalf of someone that *wasn't* assaulted. A cabbie isn't going to offer to be a witness to something that didn't happen.       I would report the hell out of that to the police. Being drunk is no excuse for an assault. Being drunk NEVER excuses anything, if a person can't handle their alcohol without becoming violent, they should make the decision to abstain from it. Those \"friends\" of yours don't sound like friends at all. About those people, I'd just talk to them when you're all sober and stand your ground. \n\nI'm really sorry this happened to you, and I wouldn't let him get away with it.    I don't drink with people I don't trust completely.\n\nAs a result, I don't drink much.\n\nThis has never gone poorly for me. Food for thought.\n\nI think you should talk to your friends about their failures as friends and decent human beings, and I think you should SERIOUSLY reevaluate the company you keep sober and otherwise. You got assaulted and they just laughed and mocked you. Fuck them.  I agree wholeheartedly and I think that's what freaking me out more than anything else. \n\nMy roommate is, supposedly, my best friend. We went abroad together after many long conversations about needing someone who wholeheartedly \"had the other's back\" and decided we both felt comfortable enough. \n\nWe have since spoke about it, and she was really apologetic. More about letting our other friend -- who she is much closer with than I am -- influence her too much, drunk or sober. \n\n     Submitting someone to criminal charges just to **feel better** is a little silly. Of course his behavior wasn't respectable, and being intoxicated shouldn't change anything when it comes to assault; I am getting the vibe this post has been fluffed up, to assert your perspective to strangers over what actually happened. \nIf this actually happened to the wire I can't conceive that the events would play out as you say they did. Any normal person i.e. your friends would get out and go to the police, or the taxi driver would go to the police immediately. What I think is that you're letting phrases and ideas like \"guy laid a hand on me\", \"**Screaming** that he cant fucking touch me\", and letting that blow-up in your head, but what I think it is, is you feel betrayed that your friends basically chose a stranger over you, and were laughing/having a good time in a cab, while you had to take a separate cab. You're letting that feeling manifest into something else. Manifest into this **guy** being a huge jerk, *assaulting* a **women**; to save your feeling of self-worth. I think you should let it all go: the incident, your \"friends\", and these negative memories.

However I do think you were extremely overly dramatic for crying, screaming, wanting to talk to the cops, refusing to get in a cab with your friends and non-aggressive Tom. But hey you'd probably both been drinking which accounts for both of your behaviours, but still doesn't make them acceptable. Sorry you had to deal with his shit, but maybe try and create less drama in return. A guy acted like a dick to you, I don't think you should've risen to it as much as you did, and I think involving the police is a bit silly: \"He *pushed* me!\"\n\nHonestly, if a guy grabbed/handled my friend (in the context you'd described) I'd be pissed, but if she behaved the way you did she'd loose pretty much all my sympathy. Especially the comment about wanting to talk to the cops just to \"feel better\" - why not just go home with your friends quietly and have a cup if tea? Seems like you made the situation a whole lot worse by working yourself up so much.\n\nMy advice would be to confront your roommate sober and say \"I'm sorry I overreacted but what happened was extremely upsetting for me and I would have appreciated your support, because I would have supported you.\" I would like to know why you feel this way. If I was told I could share a cab, and then someone infringed on my personal space, manhandled me, and attacked me (I consider shoving twice to definitely be an attack) I would not be a happy camper. No one has any right to be that much of a douchebag.\n\n1. OP was just manhandled by a stranger in an aggressive manner. I would not consider her reaction to be \"overly dramatic\" but rather in line with a proper response. \n2. \"Refusing to get in the cab with your friends and non-aggressive Tom.\" There is already a group there and I am generally assuming that her abuser got into the cab as that was what he was so upset about in the first place. Why should she be considered \"overly dramatic\" for refusing to put herself in another possibly harmful situation?\n\n3. I would want to talk to the cops after I have been assaulted by a stranger. Someone approaches me and shoves me twice? I will not take that lying down. You say \"He pushed me!\" like it was a simple nudge or accident. She was knocked to the ground and shoved AGAIN. This is assault, this is aggressive, and this is a matter for the police. \n\n4. Back to the crying. She was just shocked (who expects to be attacked like that?) and then her friends who should be a source of comfort and safety are refusing to comfort her and get her to safety. That is just adding insult to injury. Crying is not in the least overly dramatic here. Returning to the idea of contacting the police, the police would give her the comfort and safety she wants from her friends and others. She wants the situation fixed and those in the wrong punished.\n\n5. She essentially wants to do the right thing-- report it to the police. You are saying that you would lose all sympathy for her because she wants to do the right thing. I can't even wrap my mind around that. Why? Where are you getting this from? I am genuinely curious. I do not believe that OP overreacted in the slightest and would like to know why you think she has. I just want to preface this by saying I'm in no way defending the guy's actions, they were unacceptable.\n\nTo answer your questions - I just have this image of OP hysterically crying and screaming and making a scene which, yes, looses pretty much all sympathy from me. A simple \"Get the fuck off me you douchebag\" or walking away would've sufficed *or even explaining the situation to him rather than immediately flying off the handle.* And yeah, going and telling the cops \"Hey, that d-bag over there is acting aggressively towards me\" is also fine if that's how she wants to deal with it. Wanting to talk to the police doesn't loose my sympathy, but all her other behaviours do.\n\nWhat I refuse to agree with is that screaming and crying is not overreacting, OP didn't sound like she even attempted to maintain any kind of rational emotional control. She sounded like she became aggressive back -  I've always been taught to walk away from physical confrontations, not verbally engage and bait my aggressor.\n\nEspecially since it sounds to me like a misunderstanding on the guy's part - he's drunk and he suddenly notices a random girl getting in his/friend's can so he pulls her away, and being drunk doesn't have full control of his strength/coordination, maybe it didn't happen like that, but it sounds to me a bit like it did, then for OP to go psycho and scream at him and cry...\nJust an alternate perspective, do you think he was really trying to harm OP or simply (overreacting) trying to prevent her from 'stealing' his cab?\n\nThem OP turns her attack on her friends:\n&gt; I screamed at my friends\n\nIf I was in a cab and my friend threw such a fit over a misunderstanding and screamed at me I'm just going to think \"Oh Jesus, can't you just get in so we can go home\" - especially if we're all drunk and tiered. But I agree that if her aggressor was in the cab she was justified in refusing to join her friends.\n\nI think what it comes down to for me is I pride myself in rising above situations and attempting to maintain some sort of dignity and control, and it sounded like OP overreacted and acted poorly. I can understand her friend's annoyance and indifference, especially since they probably just wanted to get home and she was (overre)acting extremely childishly.\n\nPlus I think it's completely understandable that her roommate feel asleep in the 20 minutes between arriving home and OP retreating to her room (maybe they thought she'd gone to bed or wanted to give her space and time to calm down) especially since it was late after a night of drinking.\n\nOP's self righteous rage just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nDownvote away. If someone drunkenly pushed and hit me multiple times, no way in hell would I decide to try to start a \"rational\" dialogue about the situation. That's really crazy advice for you to give to someone. Even if he wasn't trying to hurt her, and was \"trying to prevent her from stealing his cab\", pushing and hitting someone is wrong and ILLEGAL. Crying was her natural response, and I think plenty of people would cry after being assaulted in front of their friends and have their friends betray them. Should she have screamed? I don't know. I would scream for help to get an officers attention at least. \n\nI'm a little confused about why you're trying so hard to defend someone who uses physical force and harm against someone else to get their own way.\n\nSide note: ending a post in \"downvote away\" sounds a bit confrontational and seems like you aren't open to other opinions or discussion.

I usually lay there for a few minutes and then just walk to the bathroom to go pee, where most of it will come out. But I don't automatically turn into a faucet the second I stand up, lol. I mean, I dunno, maybe a tiny bit comes out on the way to the toilet, but that's not a huge deal to me so I don't bother with a towel or anything. Thank god, I thought I was a freak. I'm perfectly fine on the way to the bathroom, or even if I just lay there with him for a bit.  Oh good! I just kept scrolling down trying to find someone that said she doesn't really do anything, and I started feeling like I was the only one lol. I didn't know it was common to drip so much, haha. I don't get it, either. Like, I might have a little drip down my thigh on the way to the bathroom, but it's not like it just gushes out and plops on the floor. It's never really been much of an issue. Maybe it's a matter of pelvic floor strength or something? Oh good!

TIL that peeing after sex is a pretty common occurrence.  And here I thought I was just weird.    I don't understand women who don't use condoms. If you're on birth control, aren't you *avoiding* being pregnant? I've known way too many women who've gotten pregnant while on the pill to trust it completely. I've had condoms slip off mid-act, thankfully I was also on the pill, but that's enough for me to trust the pill over condoms personally, not in a general sense. I take mine religiously and my boyfriend and I are on the same page about what would happen if I ended up pregnant, so the extra expense/annoyance of condoms isn't worth it to me. I've been on the pill for six years now and have missed fewer than one pill per year, and I've had no accidents. Maybe I'm just lucky. \n\nYou make a solid point, I'm not arguing with that, but I wanted to provide some personal reasoning. I don't understand women who don't use condoms. If you're on birth control, aren't you *avoiding* being pregnant? I've known way too many women who've gotten pregnant while on the pill to trust it completely. I am not a big fan of the feeling, and my partner sometimes has trouble with them. Clean up isn't as easy, but either way one of us was running to the bathroom.\n\nI've also got Implanon, and it isn't going anywhere. I don't understand women who don't use condoms. If you're on birth control, aren't you *avoiding* being pregnant? I've known way too many women who've gotten pregnant while on the pill to trust it completely. i have a mirena, i trust it WAY more than i trust a condom.                 Even though I'm on BC, my boyfriend still pulls out. We know its not really a \"better\" method, but it makes me feel safer. After, he'll get up, grab a wet towel, and wipe me off. This typically gets pretty intimate and leads to a round two!                         Mine is probably a really wasteful way, but I have a Costco membership and I buy their panty liners (it's like 600 for $6.00). First, I drip a bit into a paper towel, throw that in the trash, but when I go to the bathroom, (I have roommates), I put a pantyliner on my underwear when I go in so I don't drip everywhere. Then I just pee, wiggle around a bit (sometimes it just comes out all at once!) and flush.\n\n\nIf you are feeling particular tired, I suggest keeping condoms on the side of the bed. When I am too tired for clean up, but still want to have some sex times (and then go to bed from an amazing O), he will put on the condom when he's close. My SO appreciates that I will have sex, even if I'm a bit too tired to get dressed and clean-up afterwards. (it's like taking turns for clean-up!)\n\n\nAs a side note, it's always a great idea to have additional condoms as back-up birth control. Don't buy it when you need it, ALWAYS have some on hand. We all at one time or another take a pill late, so stay prepared!  What? You use panty liners for like 5 seconds while you make a beeline to the bathroom? Isn't that awkward to place in front of him, and kind of a waste?\n\nI keep tissues next to the bed, wipe up the excess, throw on a nightie (also have roommates) and go quickly to the bathroom.   Is it awkward to that on in front of him? Not really. I mean... we are having sex together... Maybe I don't understand what you are asking...?\n\n\nA nightie is a good idea. It could be considered a waste, but usually I leave on the pantyliner on overnight or for another few hours (if it's daytime sex) in case I didn't get it all (which I usually don't). \n\nMaybe you don't have this happen to you, but sometimes after I wipe up, it all sort of comes out at once! Or even once it does, it sort of drips for the next 15 minutes or so. I just don't like to get the cum on my undies. \n\nBut you are right, it's sort of a waste! I'll take your idea of a nightie under consideration (I don't own any currently).  ",

    "title" : "Losing weight and happy with myself, but not happy with interactions with other people. Can you ladies add perspective?",
    "snippet" : "Hello ladies of 2X! \n\nI have always been a relatively healthy weight, but I realized I was not eating actually eating healthy, so I've changed my diet to reflect healthy eating (more fruits and veggies, less processed food). I've lost about 8-10% body fat and I've been loving my body and loving the healthy and natural slow way I've been losing weight and that's it's becoming a lifestyle for me. Mostly, I love how I feel.\n\n\nHowever, before I did this, I was a bit chubby (considered overweight by some measures, but not all). My interactions with people before seemed more genuine. People seemed interested in me more as a person and also didn't seem as intimidated. \n\nNow that I'm about 19-20% body fat, I have found that people try to spend time with me, even if we have nothing in common! I met a guy who was very nice and respectful (as all people should be), but he really liked rap, going to clubs, partying all the time, and I am very school orientated, night time in girl. \n\n\nWell, he kept texting me and I told him that I thought he was really nice and sweet, but I didn't feel that we had enough in common to connect. He didn't act rude, but I've found that before, when I was a bit heavier, people would still be nice and polite, but they only spent time with me because they found me interesting! Now I found myself surrounded by people who don't really care about me as a person and it's sort of hard to filter through them. I hope this doesn't come off as cocky. I'm not offended if people don't want to hang out with because we have nothing in common, but I'm starting to feel like people only like me for how I look! It's much harder to meet people in a way.\n\n\nLadies do you relate? Have you found that the more you lose weight or dress better or wear more make-up or show more importance about your looks, that that's what people value most about you (your looks)? \n\n\nLadies, I think more than anything, I just need some perspective from people who've gone through this before. How do I handle it? Do you guys do anything in particular? I don't want to turn into those girls who suddenly become bitchy to anyone who is nice to them and suddenly assume that all everybody likes about me is my looks! So, just some advice on how best to handle my future interactions! Sorry if this comes off as bragging or something in advance.\n\n**TL;DR**: Losing weight and find that I'm dealing with a lot more people who only talk to me because I'm more attractive, not because we share similar ideals.\n\n\n*As a side note, if any ladies would like some help with losing weight by eating healthier, I used this (http://www.youtube.com/user/psychetruth) youtube channel to help me learn about nutrition, weight loss, and fitness. It's just very educational - not focused on exploiting insecurities to make you buy something!*   I've yet to find a way to handle this conundrum without resorting to hiding away from humanity as much as possible and bitching out everyone whom I think might have ulterior motives or just interested in me because I'm somewhat pretty :(   You're definitely not the first person to lose weight and encounter this -- I remember reading an article in Oprah by a woman who had gastric bypass. The article was about learning to love herself at a healthy weight, because she had learned to be so confident at her extremely large and very unhealthy prior weight. She said when she started going out post-surgery, she realized that all the extra weight had weeded out a lot of assholes, and it felt very strange to be hit on by so many gross men only interested in her looks.\n\nI've encountered something similar, not with losing weight, but in coming to college and being able to shed my former nerdy reputation from high-school. It was a bit weird to suddenly be something of a \"hot girl\" -- I've found myself doubting what guys want from me a lot more. The best you can do is continue to be confident in yourself and pay attention to your gut feeling on who is and isn't right for you, and make an effort to surround yourself with good people.  I don't know, I'm generally considered \"a bitch\" to random dudes that approach me in public.  I have no interest in meeting guys, don't want them approaching me, and don't want to waste my time trying to \"politely\" turn them down when I know what's going to happen beforehand.  \n\nIf a random guys talks to me I generally give him a suspicious look, reply shortly and curtly to any questions, and if he continues I either walk away or tell him to go away.  I have girl friends who are nicer than me who kind of \"cater\" to them nicely, answering questions in a friendly but not leading manner and looking for polite areas to bow out of the convo, but I don't like to do that, I find it a waste of time, and I don't care about their ego.\n\nIt's your choice to decide how you want to deal with it.  There isn't one right answer. No matter how neutral I try to be, anything polite ends up getting misconstrued into interest. So I don't try to be polite anymore. And then when you refuse to give them your phone number (or go home with them or whatever) then you get called a bitch anyways, so let's just speed it along!        People will tend to ignore and only spend time with the overweight if they have to. They'll fall all over themselves to spend time with people who are thin/fit.\n\nLike you, I've been both fat and thin in my life. I almost feel sorry for people who haven't had this experience. If they've only been fat they might think people everywhere treat one another as poorly as they've been treated. If they're thin, they might think that everyone gets treated as nicely as they get treated. \n\nHaving been both really opens your eyes. \n\nThat said, you're one of the lucky ones. Now you can tell who's interested in you vs. only interested in your body. \n\nHow do you handle it? The same way as before. If they start showing interest, talk to them and see if they talk back at you like you're a human being. But if they switch talk to being superficial, or how much they want to go out for a drink/dinner/etc. then you know you're dealing with someone who isn't interested in you as a person.    ",

    "title" : "Wanting to be wanted",
    "snippet" : "I am confused.\n\nI had a fight with my boyfriend last night because he thinks that his desires are disgusting. He is very much a feminist, and thinks that as a male, it is disturbing and not \"proper\" when he acts on feelings of desire. This is out of fear of \"taking advantage\" of me (or any woman).\n\nI dislike this attitude, because my particular brand of feminism is that men and women are both people, and that sexual relations should be consensual and equal - I don't appreciate the way he's putting me on a pedestal and refusing to treat himself like a person with perfectly acceptable desires. I wish that he wouldn't bring gender politics into our sex life - I just want us both to be able to ask for/initiate sex when we want to, and both to be able to say no when the other person asks and we don't want to have sex.\n\nHe thinks it's \"messed up\" that I want to be wanted. For me, it is incredibly sexy when someone who I have a relationship expresses desire for me - this is basically how I orient myself to sex. He knows this, and in the past he has been generally good and ostensibly sincere in expressing how much he wants me and whatnot, but sometimes he is extremely reluctant to tell me when he wants to have sex - when I would be ecstatic to hear that and to comply. This is unfortunate, because it puts me in the position of initiating more often, which makes me feel a little needy. This isn't a huge problem, but if he actually does want to ask me for sex and is just repressing himself for (as I see it) no reason, I wish he'd just... stop doing that!\n\nI am confused about whether my attitude is normal/acceptable or not. I feel pretty strongly that he's being condescending by trying to \"protect\" me from his desires, as well as depriving me of a feeling that I love - the knowledge that he wants me.\n\nI guess the other problem to note with my boyfriend is that he isn't good at changing things - he often admits that something is a problem he has but refuses to see it as something he can work on because it is \"too hard.\" This is something that drives me crazy, as I am a really practical person who communicates well and tries to work on problems as they arise.\n\nSo sorry for the rant! Relevant info - we're both pretty young college students (18 and 19), we've been together for only a few months but were friends for a while before that. We are very very close.  I'm a guy and I feel (or used to feel) similarly to how your boyfriend feels.  For me it stemmed from exposure to sex first as a negative thing (abuse, rape... not of myself but of women by men) rather than a positive thing.  Still to this day I can't enjoy receiving oral sex because I get self-conscious about these sorts of things.\n\nI'm not sure what advice I can give other than just letting you know that it took a girl that was quite certain of what she wanted, and who actually wanted it from me, for me to start to shift on this...   I don't suppose he has been reading literature such as Loving to Survive: Sexual Terror, Men’s Violence, and Women’s Lives by Dee L.R. Graham by any chance? My those sound like uplifting titles...    [deleted] I don't know that I agree that it sounds intentional. I've come across a few guys who were raised in some really odd environments who have this sort of attitude. \n\nIt usually seems to be guys who were made to feel ashamed of things like porn and liking super sexy characters and things and who received some sort of half-baked feminist education. Frequently they also have abusive or sexist fathers or were raised by single mothers because their dad walked out when she got pregnant. Usually there's an embittered or angry woman who feels (rightly or wrongly) that she was used in some way or wronged in some way in their past as well.\n\nBut I do think that him not addressing what is clearly an unhealthy attitude is a problem, because intentionally or not, he's hurting OP. It sounds like it's a pretty big deal to her and for him to not even try to address it is concerning. I don't know that I agree that it sounds intentional.

Is extra fat tissue really that much more sexual than a pectoral muscle? It can't be the nipples because men have them too, so why are female nipples obscene? Because they also have an actual purpose for feeding children? \n\nIt literally makes no sense I do not understand. It seems like it's the last real societal stronghold on female modesty &gt;  Is extra fat tissue really that much more sexual than a pectoral muscle?\n\nIt's not the extra fact tissue that makes it a highly erogenous zone in women. Science shouldn't even be needed for this discussion, but if you want some [here you are](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1743-6109.2011.02388.x). From the conclusions: \n\n&gt; *\"Activation of the genital sensory cortex by nipple self-stimulation was unexpected, but suggests a neurological basis for women's reports of its erotogenic quality.\"*  \n\nBut hey, if you really want it to be treated equally, does that mean guys also get to touch women breasts casually, the same way women can touch men's chests?  \n In what context is it appropriate for a woman to \"touch a mans chest\" casually? Like a stranger? What?\n\nAnd lots of men are turned on by nipple stimulation, it's not gender specific  I'm okay with breasts being viewed as attractive or sexy.  I'm just not okay with them being viewed as obscene.  I'd like it if breasts were on par with a pair of chiseled abs: fun to look at, extremely attractive, sexually appealing in the right context, *but not considered obscene and horrific for children to see.*\n\nActually, I think my beef with this double standard is that sexuality in the media is seen as more vulgar than violence.  \n\n^^^Also ^^^that ^^^guy ^^^has ^^^a ^^^really ^^^nice ^^^chest... I was actually just thinking about this a couple days ago, and I totally agree. I *like* that breasts are sexualized, and that I can feel sexy showing cleavage. I just think that they should be viewed more like a well toned male chest in terms of obscenity.  On some Korean tv networks, male nipples are blurred. Saw a reality show where some celebrities go to the beach and the guys were all blurred out around their chest.  I was actually just thinking about this a couple days ago, and I totally agree. I *like* that breasts are sexualized, and that I can feel sexy showing cleavage. I just think that they should be viewed more like a well toned male chest in terms of obscenity.  To add to this, I would NOT feel comfortable if breasts were seen as any other body part - like my forearm or back.  I'm missing something. Why? I'm ok with someone putting their hand on my back or grabbing me by the forearm... I'm ok with someone putting their hand on my back or grabbing me by the forearm... Why?

Others can hold whatever absurd views they like. And they can express those absurd views.\n\nWhat is a problem is the cultural and legal practice that the possibility of someone finding X obscene constitutes grounds for censoring X.\n\nMoreover, this applies as much to genitals as it does to breasts.\n\n Well, genitals are covered up for hygienic reasons, since they're potential biohazards. But they're not obscene, no. Can you point to any condition that is passed from the genitals to another person via the air or an inanimate object?\n\nIf by \"biohazard\" you mean \"might dirty my furniture\" ... sure. That's enough to require that a person protect the furniture from their genitals (as conventionally happens when nudists and restaurants meet in the San Francisco's Castro district, I hear). Any kind of bodily fluid can carry disease, and not just STI's.  This is why it's illegal to pee or masturbate in public, and why it's considered assault to spit on someone.  I don't think you'd want to sit your bare genitals in a pool of some stranger's saliva, would you?  It's the same concept with genital secretions.  How about the fact that genitals are directly involved with urination?  You probably wouldn't want to be putting your hand over urine smears. Most importantly, the genitals are extremely close to the anus, which is quite possibly the filthiest public health hazard of all. I don't fancy getting e coli, do you?  And don't forget that half the population spurts blood from their genitalia once per month!\n\n&gt;That's enough to require that a person protect the furniture from their genitals (as conventionally happens when nudists and restaurants meet in the San Francisco's Castro district, I hear).\n\nThat's great, but that's a decision made by a private business.  If it were universally acceptable in our society to rub your bare crotch over anything you could possibly sit on, *especially* in public places, we'd have to set out protective coverings over anything that could be sat on, coverings that would have to be changed every single time someone got up and left.  Do you have any idea how prohibitively expensive and wasteful that would be?  \n\n\nFurthermore, it's not just genitals that are potentially dirty, but surfaces that would come into contact with genital areas would be guaranteed to be filthy.  We can't be running around sanitizing disgusting bus seats and park benches every moment of every day.  \n\nAll that would be a pretty ridiculous endeavor to undergo just because some people are miffed that they don't get to ride the bus naked .  &gt; Any kind of bodily fluid can carry disease.\n\nRight but in the trace quantities left by brief contact on surfaces left by genitals most of these diseases die off once outside the body. So most of us, around the world, have no problem using toilet seats that may have hand brief contact from genitals and low levels of genital or anal discharge (microscopic traces of urine, faces, menstrual fluid).\n\nSome hypochondriacs will hover above toilet seats or use toilet seat covers. We understand that, however, is a problem with them. \n\nWhere microscopic amounts body fluids do transmit disease we have no general requirement for people to cover the body part that discharges these. We don't require the general population, for example, to wear face masks because they could be an unwitting Tuberculous carrier. \n\nThe proposition is to allow people to walk nude, not to free them to piss, shit, or bleed all over the park benches.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, it's not just genitals that are potentially dirty, but surfaces that would come into contact with genital areas would be guaranteed to be filthy. We can't be running around sanitising disgusting bus seats and park benches every moment of every day. \n\nNo. But all that is required is that a nudist put a cloth down, facing the right way, before they sit down. There need never be a direct contact from genitals or anuses on public human made surfaces. There is no additional public expense incurred.\n\nTo the extent this is done in Castro I believe this is the general practice.\n\nThe hygiene argument against nudity is without merit. &gt;The proposition is to allow people to walk nude, not to free them to piss, shit, or bleed all over the park benches.\n\nIf someone is walking nude, they are going to sit on something.  If a woman is on her period and is walking around nude, she absolutely will be bleeding all over the place whether she's walking or sitting.  Not all women are comfortable with or can wear tampons.  For many women, tampons are not enough to staunch their heavy flows.  If you decide to make a law saying women aren't allowed to walk around naked while on her period so as to avoid the health hazard, that's sexual discrimination.     Ironic that this is tagged as NSFW.  I might have evolved beyond caring about stuff like that, my boss hasn't yet. Ironic that this is tagged as NSFW.  Yeah, that guy's chest is easily as sexy as the woman's, and I'm a straight male.

I'm not surprised that the woman's breasts are on the smaller end of the spectrum - sadly, with the status quo being what it is, it makes the image easier to digest, and helps facilitate the message.\n\nIn my mind, I'm considering this sort of a \"baby step\" towards the larger issue of all breasts being seen as perfectly normal parts of the human body.

My nipples are no more obscene than his. Deal with it! Serious question. Are you OK with guys casually touching your chest, in the same way that guys are generally OK with people casually touching their chest? None of my male friends are okay with people casually touching their chests. Even my boyfriends have told me it is inappropriate to do so in public or outside of foreplay. This does not apply when any of them are drunk though. But to answer your question, my breasts like the rest of my body require permission from me to touch.

Also don't know where you are from. But I have travelled quite a bit and lived in different countries, and I haven't met a culture where that would hold true. \n\nIn training someone may tap my chest while passing by me as to say, \"well done\" dude. Someone may playfully push a me away by putting their hand on my chest, as in \"get out of here\". Or a girl I'm close to may hold me from behind and wrap arms around my chest. When calling for my attention they may tap with the fingers on my chest. When asking to check a collar no one will be actively trying to not accidentally touch a men's chest. \n\nLike I said, I don't know where you live, but the image of a guy taking offence at any of those things is certainly outside of reality as I've experienced it. Even in the most touch averse culture I know (Japanese) most of that would be acceptable while maybe a bit uncommon. \n\n&gt; But to answer your question, my breasts like the rest of my body require permission from me to touch. \n\nAgain I don't know where you live. And I understand having ownership of one's body. But this makes me think of highschool friends about to take a group photo and all asking each other for permission to put hands around each other. That or the ultimate overhand picture. When taken literally it just seems silly. And if it's not to be taken literally then it's not very relevant. \n\n&gt; It bothers me more when strangers think they can walk up and put their greasy mitts all over my hair.\n\nI know lots of girls who don't like having their hair touched.

I guess my question is: weren't you socialized to see *other people's* chests as sexual before you had breasts? \n\n Sort of, I think, but identifying as and later biologically becoming a woman kind of cemented over that. I've never really thought of breasts as exclusively sexual, and I was socialized not to care about my own chest (which, of course, I *did* just because I was *different*).

I think everyone should equally keep their clothes on. I think everyone should equally keep their clothes on. Why?  That's just how I feel about it. I'm curious, though. Does the naked body offend you? What about it bothers you? (No judgment here, just wondering.) I think everyone should equally keep their clothes on. Would you want there to be a law enforcing this?  No, not at all.  I'm not trying to force people to cover up.  I just think the issue might be better handled if it was getting men to go shirtless less as opposed making it so women can be topless.\n\nThat and, like I said, I prefer clothes on people :p K cool, just making sure it was only preference.  Definitely only preference :).\n\n\nThank you for responding in a non-abrasive manner.   I'd actually go the other way to the majority of commenters here: I'd like both male and female chests to be considered obscene, instead of both being seen as \"acceptable in context\" I'd actually go the other way to the majority of commenters here: I'd like both male and female chests to be considered obscene, instead of both being seen as \"acceptable in context\" I'd actually go the other way to the majority of commenters here: I'd like both male and female chests to be considered obscene, instead of both being seen as \"acceptable in context\" I don't think either should be considered obscene, but I agree that either sex being topless in public is indecent.  I do think it should be legal, as I think full nudity should; I don't think legislating that sort of thing is necessary.\n\nAlso, not to be needlessly pedantic, but I have to point out that nudity laws and obscenity laws aren't the same thing; in American law, a photograph or depiction of breasts, no matter how sexually posed, can never be obscene.  *Miller v. California,* 413 U.S. 15 (1973). I'd actually go the other way to the majority of commenters here: I'd like both male and female chests to be considered obscene, instead of both being seen as \"acceptable in context\" Exactly like what I said.  Every one should cover up equally. Just because *you're* uncomfortable with the human body, likely your own, does not mean you should endorse the censoring of it. People as a whole should see human bodies as a beautiful thing, and if you don't, that's you're own hang up. Don't take it out on others by telling them to \"cover up\" when they're perfectly comfortable and confident in their own bodies, their lovers' bodies, and their neighbors' bodies. Imagine if that were accepted? Nothing would happen other than love. We weren't born with clothes. I disagree completely with you. Thanks for assuming!\n\nI'm not at all uncomfortable with the human body.  I just don't like it being displayed 100% naked for no reason.  And just because *you're* comfortable with the human body, doesn't mean you should endorse the showing of it.  Don't force your abrasive opinions down someone's throat in such a rude way.  Especially not if you're wanting to change the way they think.\n\nAlso, I'm not uncomfortable with my body.  I'm beautiful, and I think almost everyone is beautiful as well.  I can appreciate biology without needing to see someone naked.  I think people look better with clothes on and that is my *opinion*, to which I am entitled.\n\nYou'll notice I didn't forsake anyone for wanting to be naked.  Nor have I forsaken you for enjoying nakedness.  So get off your high horse, come back down to my level, and then try having a conversation with me about this.\n\nEdit: All in all, I could give a flying fuck less whether or not the human body is scene as obscene or beautiful or whatever.    &gt;All in all, I could give a flying fuck less whether or not the human body is scene as obscene or beautiful or whatever.\n\nThen you have no business posting in this thread. You have no business in the first place posting rude comments to me for absolutely no reason. I have no idea what you're angry or who you're angry at, but take it out on someone else.  Who else other than somebody who wants me to cover my body? The only thing rude about my comment was my comment about you likely being uncomfortable with your own body to feel that way about somebody else's. Did you even read the rest? I never told you to cover your body, jesus.  In fact, I didn't say *anything* directly to you until you so angrily replied to my post.  I'd actually go the other way to the majority of commenters here: I'd like both male and female chests to be considered obscene, instead of both being seen as \"acceptable in context\" I disagree with you, but I don't think your opinion should be silenced, so have an upvote.        This may as well have been two dudes for how flat she was.  Use a model with big boobs and a man with big old moobs, and then ask why the moobs are cool, but the boobs are not.  It was a nice idea, but a poor execution.  \n\nEDIT:  To those downvoting:  They wanted to make a point, so they shouldn't use two beautiful, perfect people anyone would be happy to look at.  They should have used realistic people, and asked the same question.  That's my point.  We are okay looking at flabby men with no shirts on, but a woman of any size can't go without a top?  What's the real difference? This may as well have been two dudes for how flat she was.

While you're correct that only the woman would face legal issues with nudity, I don't know anyone who would actually prefer to look at the flabby man. I didn't say prefer - I said it's considered acceptable. Big difference.  [deleted] Female breasts are only viewed with sexual connotations due to socially learned behaviors. Compare tribal African cultures views of exposed female breasts to that of the Northern hemisphere. \n\nSexual connotations do not have to be negative. Why do we allow kids to see acts which are violent but cannot figure out how to talk to them about sex, which is primarily an activity associated with love?\n\nI don't see how you can really deny these notions with a straight face. [deleted] But isn't this largely socialized? In many parts of Europe it's totally common for women and men of all ages and sizes to go topless. Nudes grace the covers of magazines and even daytime TV commercials. Back when American women wore long skirts on a daily basis, ankles became a sexualized body part. I'm not planning to walk around my city's streets with my naked breasts aflutter, but I think people in the US are way too reactionary when they see a boob. Case in point: Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl. Would never have been nearly the controversy it was had it happened in, say, France. [deleted]  I don't think society will ever be able to reach this level of equality. Men will always see breast as fap  material and women will see another women's breasts as an unrealistic expectation. We can barely put female models on the cover of a magazine without being accused of sexist, unrealistic pressures on \"beauty\". There are just too many individual social issues that block this level of progress. How men react to the female form, women accepting (but not excusing) the type of attention their body will bring, ending the constant comparisons between women, and a general acceptance, confidence, and sense of individuality with the concept of beauty. To name a few.\n\n I don't think society will ever be able to reach this level of equality.

    "snippet" : "I am at a complete loss or words and I would love some support. My boyfriend (29) and I (19) (I know it's a big age gap-no need to point it out!) have been going out for a year. I have never been so in love. \n\nAbout 5 months into the relationship I left for a month to visit my family. We had sent eachother dirty pictures but nothing SUPER risque at the time. During that month we of course skyped and today, 7 months later, I found recordings of our sexy Skype convos! I don't know whether to be pissed or what- I'm just at a loss for words. We are in the European time zone, so it's currently 1am and I am stuck at his house until morning. He's sleeping and I'm sitting here wondering what to do. He knows I saw and is obviously embarrassed. \n\nBasically, I don't know whether I should be mad or not because I obviously did that stuff with his consent seeing it... But recording?! I'm just hurt and shocked. \n\nI hope this is an okay place to post this, I don't have any close friends around (due to language barrier) and I just need some females to comfort me! What would you do? \n\nOn my phone so I apologize for mistakes :)\n\n\n**also, I should add that if he had asked it would have been fine. Or I'd he said, \"hey! I recorded this convo can I keep it?\" I probably still would have said yes. But months without me knowing it and he hiding it I feel is totally different. :/ also, if I ask to delete them he will, but it's not about that. It's the fact he did something like that without my permission or knowledge**   Talk to him about *why* he recorded them. Did he record them to share them? Did he record them so he could just listen to them again because he loves your sexy conversations?\n\nObviously he shouldn't have done it without your knowledge and consent. Although, knowing you're being recorded would likely affect your \"performance\" and give a different result, so his thinking can be understood. Not commending it of course, still doesn't give him the right.\n\nTalk to him about it, and tell him how.. (is *violated* the right word here?) you feel, and try to find out his motivations for doing it.  Yeah... this would really bother me.  I'm in the category of people who leave ***no*** evidence.  The only naked photos that exist of me are ones my parents took of me as an infant. I just don't like the idea of something meant to be private being recorded.  Sure I trust my SO, but there are lots of ways someone else could get a hold of that kind of thing.  I would demand they be deleted.  And then my SO would have to repair the trust that he had broken. Because this would be seriously not cool with me.   I would get absolutely furious. Without permission? That is disgusting. What went through his mind? While you guys are talking or doing things over Skype, he decides it would be a fabulous idea to make you the star in a movie you don't even know about? I'm sorry, that is an extreme violation. It is absolutely understandable that you feel hurt and shocked.  I would have done the same thing if I were him.  If he keeps it he obviously loves it and wants to watch it again and again and that's fine and natural.  I personally don't think it's as big a deal, My boyfriend has taken pictures of me asleep while naked and I take it as a huge compliment.  isn't it flattering to know he'd rather watch that video than to watch porn stars?  I imagine he didn't ask for one of a few reasons. \n\n\n* He thought it was weird to ask\n\n\n* He forgot\n\n\n* It's sexy to keep it a secret\n\n\nIf it creeps you out address it with him,  but don't make him feel bad for being attracted to you.",

    "snippet" : "I usually love sex. My boyfriend and I have amazing sex and it's the best I've ever had. Sometimes when I couldn't get wet we've used lube and it has helped. I still was aroused and wanted it, but lately it's like I can't get wet at all and it just doesn't feel good and we can't even finish. It's becoming frustrating. I have gotten better at blowjobs though... Can someone give me some tips on how to resolve this?   Are you on birth control? A possible side effect is dryness, so it could be that. You could look into changing brands or just buying some lube to help.  No I'm not on birth control. I've been wanting to start but now I'm scared too. I don't want lube to be a necessity.   No I'm not on birth control. I've been wanting to start but now I'm scared too. I don't want lube to be a necessity.   Are you on any other medication? When I was on Zoloft it killed my libido and dried me up I don't take anything. I think it maybe could be my diet or something?    You really just need to get lube. I use lube regularly. It makes everything better. We've used it I just don't want to have to use it.   We've used it I just don't want to have to use it.   A lot of people use lube, but the downvotes you're getting make me sad. There's nothing wrong with wanting to get to the bottom of why you're consistently not getting wet. It's indicative of another problem and lube could be just treating the symptom- so it makes sense you don't want to *have* to use it if you feel there's a deeper issue. This isn't necessarily \"sex-negative\" thing or \"lube-shaming\" or whatever buzzword.\n\nIn my experience, while in the early days of a relationship I'm usually ready to go in about ten seconds, my physical response to my partner generally takes a little longer to kick into overdrive.  Consider if you are engaging in enough foreplay. Consider that your anxiety about *not* getting wet could be what's causing this (in which case lube actually could help your natural fluids to flow because it takes the pressure off you). I've worried myself dry in the past. \n\nAlso consider talking to your gyno. (And stay hydrated!)   One factor might be your menstrual cycle. Some women have a lower mucus production level during their cycle, but it picks up again as the cycle continues.\n\nConsider using a lubricant or even massage oils (exterior only). \n\nIf it's a chronic problem (&gt;8 weeks) you should consider seeing your OBGYN or PCP. They can check you out, and even prescribe something or recommend something to reduce vaginal dryness. I just got over my period a few days ago he is the first guy I've had sexy with on a regular basis. I have noticed I like it better when I'm ovulating and before I start my period. Could that be it?   Up your water intake, and try a good lube - some dry up and get sticky after a while. I love [Swiss Navy](http://www.mdsciencelab.com/) products. Their original formula is great as it stays slippery and you don't need a lot, and they have a water-based one that's great for toys and an organic one as well :) I know you don't want to have to use it, but really, it's going that or not having sex at this point. Keep in mind this could be a side-effect of several health issues. If it keeps up, you should see your doctor.  Are you dehydrated/hungover? Generally that's a factor for me, drinking a lot of water can help and it's hard to remember to do that in the winter. But yeah, lube is awesome.  ",

    "snippet" : "So last night I ended up hooking up with my ex, despite us breaking up over a year ok. We've remained best friends, but haven't done anything physical until now. It ended up being a really good thing because when we broke up we didn't have any sort of closure to the physical side of our relationship (no last kiss or breakup sex - due to too many tears being involved). We've both spoken about it today and to both of us we feel like it's kind of closed a chapter for us in a way where we know that that part of us is now over. We still love an adore each other, but we know that the physical side of things is done (despite still being insanely attracted to each other physically).\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else has ever had any sort of belated closure from their past relationships?   You still love each other and are attracted to each other? ... Yup, sounds like a recipe for disaster. By the time my relationships came to an end I didn't want to have a physical closure. I had one lingering thing with one my ex's. We were besties, super close, the works. We had a few physical moments, and it just made things way messier, though neither of us thought it would. It doesn't sound like things are over at all.  No no, we love each other but aren't IN love with each other any more. We spent the year being more independent of each other, and we're still good friends. We just so happen to still find each other attractive.\n\nI can't really explain it too well, but it felt different last night. When we were together in the past, any time we were together physically I was bursting with emotion and in-love love. This time it was wonderful but I just felt the love and respect between us and it felt like a nice send off. We've been through too much to jeopardize it all, and we just know that nothing else will happen between us. It's hard to put it in words but it's like we both know that that's it now :) Well good luck to you then, and I hope everything remains swell! Just make sure that if you feel things coming back you talk to him, so you guys can see where you stand.  ",

    "snippet" : "  I was the first girl in my town to play football and did so when I was Caroline's age. It was great fun, great exercise, and taught me a lot of great life lessons. In short, it was life-changing. This little girl shouldn't be discriminated against and denied the chance to play the sport she loves. [here's the link to the change.org petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/let-girls-play-football-stop-the-discrimination-by-the-archdiocese-of-philadelphia-cyo-office) It's ridiculous that they won't let her play. If there's only a boys team then she should be allowed to play on the boys team.\n\nThis reminds of the little boy from Ireland who wanted to continue playing field hockey when he moved to the states. The problem was there were no boys field hockey teams. At first they let him play on the girls team, but then they kicked him out for being too good. He wasn't even bigger than the girls. He was this tiny 80 pound kid playing against girls much taller than him.\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57429015/n.y-boy-kicked-off-girls-field-hockey-team-for-superior-play/     I'm gonna be that person...\n\nI am all for girls playing on boys teams, and an expectation (not just grudging allowance) of unisex teams *at least* before, say, high school, when size and strength differences become greater (and even then, exceptions should be frequently and cheerfully made).\n\nBUT. Football is really dangerous, especially for young kids. The article says that the league Caroline is in is a flag football league, but it's also classified as 'full contact' - so I'm not actually sure what kind of football she would be playing.

But in a perfect world, none of them would be playing football, and none of their parents would want them to. The good thing is that at in her age bracket a boy's physique hasn't really developed muscle yet, so she's not necessarily in a dangerous spot or at a disadvantage 'for being a girl' as they say. The boys she plays with should relatively be the same size as her, although girls can be larger since they tend to get their growth spurts first.\n\nIt's not until high school does it become more likely a female would get injured due to the size and strength difference. Hormones are hormones, it is what it is. But several women have beat the odds, most memorably Holley Mangold, who was a star player for her high school team. Sadly she could not go on to play at college, but viola, she's now an Olympic athlete weightlifter. \n\nI'm all for equality - if she can pass the exact same tests there should be no reason why she can't play. If she can't pass, then she's is at a huge disadvantage and then they can say it's too risky. The same way it can be too risky for some males to play if they are not prepared to handle the level of contact required. But that call should be made on an individual (not gender) basis. I feel the same way about women in combat. I'm gonna be that person...\n\nI am all for girls playing on boys teams, and an expectation (not just grudging allowance) of unisex teams *at least* before, say, high school, when size and strength differences become greater (and even then, exceptions should be frequently and cheerfully made).\n\nBUT.

Caroline needs to find a public league to play in, not one run by a sexist, archaic institution.   I see this as the girl's first real life lesson in the misogyny of her religion.  If she wants to live and be treated as an equal, she needs to get far away from the bible.  \n  \nDoesn't her local public school have a team she could play on?? I don't believe in any religion either, but this isn't just about her religion (if she even has one). Its about her gender. I know of plenty leagues and schools that were not associated at all with any religion that wouldn't let girls play. \n\nAlso there are tons of people that don't believe in god that think girls shouldn't play with boys so don't make this a religion issue.

    "snippet" : "Six months ago I moved to a tropical country with lots of mosquitos. In my home country we don't have them so my body reacted extremely badly to the bites I got. And I got a lot. The bites start as big, really itchy bumps and then turn into little wounds that then usually turn into scars. The scars are brown and darker than my skin color so they are very visible. My feet and calves are covered and then I have some on my thighs and even my buttocks.\nThe culture here allows people to say things like \"oh, I see you've gained weight\" without it being considered offensive so people don't hesitate telling me how ugly my legs look.  \nI was only a bit self conscious about this until yesterday when I was skyping with my ex (who is still a very good friend (we only broke up because I was moving here)) and he saw my thigh on camera. He made a \"joke\" about how my legs used to be more beautiful and I felt horrible and had to stop skyping because I wanted to cry. He was devastated afterwards because he didn't think it was such a big deal to me.  \n\nI don't really know why I'm making this post. Maybe I just wanted to tell somebody. Maybe there is someone who has gone through this. Maybe you guys have some advice on how to fade the scars. I've lurked around this subreddit long enough to know that there is some great people here.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you guys so much. I'm going to try and get rid of them using your advise but if it doesn't work I'm not gonna give a fuck.  Sure there are ways that promise to make it look better, which may work or not.\n\nI have legs and arms that are covered with scars because self-harm. May I give you an advice? Don't give a fuck. \n\nJust don't. It won't take you anywhere.\n\nThey're legs. They are supposed to walk and stand if they can. They have skin. It is supposed to cover these legs.

I posted about scar treatment before, but I forgot my username.\n\nDo not listen to older women who strongly suggest vitamin E. Recent studies have shown that this will worsen the appearance of your scar and cause other problems.\n\nIf scar is brand new and still healing, use aquafur. After a couple weeks use silicon sheets. If that's unavailable where you're at, you can try some mederma.  Thanks for the advise. I saw this thing about how it's good to use vitamin E so it's good that you told me it doesn't work.  \nBut what's aquafur? I googled it but I didn't find anything related to this subject.  I'm pretty sure that scars like that tend to fade over time. What mosquito repellent do you use? [DEET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEET) is the only thing that will work in the tropics. Buy a very high concentration solution and use it religiously (you can often buy higher concentration solutions in the tropics than in the Us or Europe). It may melt your shoes and strip your nail polish, but it damn well keeps the mozzies away. Also, I have heard that high levels of vitamin B in your blood can turn away the mosquito's. I used to eat marmite religiously when I was a child and never got bitten, even in mosquito-heavy places like Australia, Zimbabwe, etc. I use a repellent called Off. It's the only thing I've seen available here and everyone uses it. Doesn't seem to work that well for me haha.  \nI'll go to bigger supermarkets/pharmacies and see if I can find something better.  \nAnd I really hope they will fade!

What helped was gently exfoliating my legs with a [foot file](http://ph.makeupandbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/How+to+Prevent+and+Treat+Cracked+Heels2.jpg) in the shower. The scars were gone in a week or two.\n\nEdit: Also, your ex is an asshole.   I'm allergic to mosquito bites too and my legs are covered with little ugly scars and they prevent me from wearing dresses and shorts in public :C\n\nSo I feel your pain When did you get most of them? Have they faded at all?  \nI've been doing some internet research and apparently there is a lazer scar treatment available but it might be pricy. I've gotten them over the last few years...and I fidget when I'm nervous and scratching can't be helped, lol.\n\nNone have them have faded at all.  In fact, if you only glance at them, they look like they could have happened a month or so ago.  Very weird.  I've tried cocoa butter and that never worked and I get a lot of vitamin E everyday so that clearly doesn't help either.\n\nI've just stayed away from wearing dresses or worn them with pantyhose and I only wear shorts when I have to or when I was forced to because I worked outdoors.  Look, I have a knee surgery scar (that has been re-opened from multiple knee surgeries), that spans about a foot and a half. It is a think scar, it is raised, it is bumpy, it turns purple when it's rainy and bright red when it's cold. People stare at it, people ask if I \"know about bio oil\", people make comments. But at the end of the day, it's a part of who I am. My partners have all loved it, along with a myriad of other unsightly scars on my body. If you feel horrible about it, absolutely try and get rid of these scars. But don't think of this as the end of your legs being BEAUTIFUL. Your legs are beautiful. You are beautiful. Fuck anyone who tells you otherwise. Scars are a sign of life experience. I'm not saying you have to love them or have to accept them (as they are surface scars, they probably will fade a lot in just a year or so through the sun etc.) But just remember, scars aren't a death sentence. You're wonderful.     I live in a tropical country. Are you scratching yourself? You should not be getting wounds unless you're scratching/picking the bites or are allergic to mosquitoes. \n\nAs for the people, they do it because they care. And I say this having gotten the \"have you gained weight?\" question all the time. Or, even worse, the \"how much do you weigh?\" from people that I just met. It's just a cultural thing and they don't mean to offend you. Yeah, I know about the cultural thing and I try to take it in my stride but sometimes I can't help but feeling a little hurt.  \nBut yes sometimes it's really hard resisting scratching because the bites are way itchier and bigger than normal ones (I have allergies). I use repellent all the time and I try to think about not scratching but the scars are already there because I've failed in the past. I will definitely try to get less bites and scratch less in the future.

Maybe you have slight allergies?  I'm allergic to like everything and my skin has kerotis polaris, excemea, gets a rash at the drop of a hat etc.  My skin is so sensitive that I have to use baby laundry detergent, dove soap etc That´s probably why you´re getting these wounds. I would see a dermatologist if you´re worried about scars. \n\nMy problem was always scratching. I did it in my sleep and now I have some pretty bad scars.   Was it [tiger mosquito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus)?      Hey!\nI live in Australia and tend to get savaged by mozzies every summer. I've learnt that sleeping in socks with mozzie bites is a terrible idea as I scratch in my sleep and it makes my skin more likely to have fallen off haha.\nI don't think that scar creams work, I just leave them and eventually they'll probably fade away :) don't stress! I only have my most recent ones, they're super dark compared to my pasty legs and I've decided screw it, I like my legs so everyone else can deal with it! Thanks for your advice!  \nOf *course* aussies call them mozzies. ",

A lot of models are around 5'11\" and 120 pounds. I think that's the low end of the healthy BMI range for that height  That's not healthy at all, that's a 16.7 BMI, and is very much underweight.  18.5 is the bare minimum weight to be considered healthy and at 5'11\" that would be about 135 pounds.   Thanks for looking up the exact numbers! I couldn't remember off the top of my head. I will stand by my statement that many models are in the 5'8- 6' height range and have weights in the 120s. Seeing how this is actually underweight for those heights you can see why it creates such a dangerous body image for girls to emulate.  Thanks! I think it has to do with cultural differences.

Back in the 60s/70s having meat on your bones was considered beautiful and healthy, but the aesthetic changed drastically in the post-Perestroika period. Thanks! I think it has to do with cultural differences. The commentators were Russian (and I am too, although I've been living abroad for most of my life) and, generally, if you weigh anywhere over 110 pounds and are female, you're pretty much considered \"fat\" in Russia. It's rather toxic, but it isn't changing anytime soon  Man, my body type must be unheard of over there. Even at my MOST in shape (eating like a health nut and running 25 miles a week) I was still 135 lbs. I'm only 5'3\", just a super amount of muscle for some reason. That is crazy, I think you look fabulous :) My girlfriend freaks out about how thick her thighs are all the time. They are phenomenal and muscular and I love them. She is absolutely gorgeous. I worship her body but she still has a bad self image. What can I do to convince her that she is perfect just the way she is? Unfortunately, in my experience, confidence comes from within. Try taking her out places, just raising her self worth and perception of life in general - hiking, traveling, that sort of thing. No matter how many times you tell her she looks amazing she's not going to truly believe it until she figures it out on her own. Confidence is a fickle thing.\n\nI know how she feels though, I was still a size 6-8 US at that weight, and believe me my body would have never gotten any smaller. I have problems with pants and tall boots because my muscular thighs and calves. It really is difficult to love yourself when you can barely find clothes! Yeesh. But I would suggest just treating her like a princess and being adventurous and she should figure it out :)  Thanks for your response. We have started hiking actually, and we have a dog that makes us get out and do physical activities more often together. We run 2-3 times a week. She has the same problem with boots and jeans. It's frustrating because I think (and tell her this) if someone as gorgeous as her has issues with self image then I can't even imagine what others must feel like. I am lucky and was born with a tall runner's build and my metabolism is through the roof so I have a hard time relating on some of the self image issues, though I have my own insecurities FOR SURE. Keep being beautiful in body and spirit internet stranger! Unfortunately, in my experience, confidence comes from within.

I'm 5\"3, and the skinniest I can ever get is 135, with giant muscular babymaking thighs. I love it, but it's so inconvenient! They do NOT make pants for us! I gained some weight back recently, and now I don't fit into hardly any of my boots! Do I really have to lose 20 lbs just to get that extra inch off my calves to get my boots back? Shoulders are another big issue too, with my man arms. Medium tshirts are almost always too tight at the shoulder, but of course large wouldnt fit at the waist (because no matter what i weigh my stomach somehow stays flat) Ugh! I'm glad there's someone out there who understands :)  My girlfriend freaks out about how thick her thighs are all the time. They are phenomenal and muscular and I love them.

A few years ago a Chinese woman poked my belly and said \"Oooh pregnant?\" And when I told her no -- most people would be embarrassed and apologize, right? She cracked up laughing and pointing saying \"oh! Because you really look pregnant!\"\n\nI've had the same experience with Germans. \"You sure? Because it looks like you are.\" I think it has to do with different cultures being more straightforward (you decide whether that's good or bad) on the lines of weight and appearance, etc. I'm Chinese and Chinese people will not hesitate to call you fat and ugly, especially if they're family.  Yeah, but there's a difference between \"straightforward\" and \"really unhealthy criticism.\" My Chinese cousin is neither remotely fat NOR remotely ugly (bordering on underweight and perfectly gorgeous) but she's convinced she's a dumpy hag because of her upbringing.

Thank you! I'm naturally blonde, and having been dying it black for 6 years until two days ago when I bleached it and dyed it a light brown. I am transitioning slowly to blonde again and I am a little paranoid about how it looks right now so I sincerely appreciate it.  I'm sure it looks great!\n\nIt was less about the color and more about the body/luster &amp; so on. :)  You look fabulous, and most importantly you look super happy and confident!  Way to go! I love seeing these posts as I'm also on a weight loss journey of my own. Very inspiring, and you look beautiful! You might enjoy posting this to /r/loseit too.  Way to go!  What did you do to lose that much weight that quickly?  I can't imagine the discipline you had to have.\n\nWas it a bariatric surgery of sorts?   Yes, I had gastric bypass surgery with great results but numerous small issues, that, when added together nearly killed me a few times. I spent a couple weeks (almost 6) hospitalized and was sent on home care with a picc line for the next 3 months. But, when all is said and done after watching my great aunt, great uncle and grandmother all suffer of diabetes, then kidney failure and eventual painful death, I am happy with my decision. I had a long difficult recovery. I am still fighting everyday and seeing specialist regularly but with great doctors, my surgery which took nearly a year to get approved, Im almost to a 'ideal'/healthy weight. I workout daily and watch my diet and my weight loss has changed my life for the better. My depression has lessened immensely, I have more energy and I'm happier knowing I can Live a healthier life. So would you recommend doing gastric bypass to a friend? Even with the complications? Did you try diet and exercise first? What kind of workout do you do now? What kind of diet? Never talked with anyone that went through with it so I am just curious. Won't be offended if you don't want to answer. You look fantastic and I like the brown better than the black, it is a softer look. Yes, I highly recommend it. I saw a total of three nutritionist prior to having the surgery on top of numerous diet attempts on my own. I tried everything- calorie counting, intense workouts, fad-diets, etc- I got no where. So after watching my relatives pass away in a non-peaceful way - I just decide to take this drastic decision. I had an amazing surgeon who walked me through everything, explained the NUMEROUS versions of weight loss surgery and helped me weigh the pros and cons of each. In the end I ended up with the bypass. My complication was Severe pancreatitis, which ended up requiring the removal of my gallbladder. I also had a complication called a gastro-gastric fistula which only about 1%of patient encounter, which develops from an ulcer in the 'pouch' exploding and causing internal bleeding which your body heals by forming a small connection between the natural stomach and the newly formed pouch. The fact that my pouch was overwhelmingly filled with ulcers was accidentally overlooked because the pain i felt was very similar to my pancreas pain and they didn't delve any deeper for quite a bit. Im still being treated for these compilcations but I'm MUCH better. So, yes, i had complications but they are rare and were of no fault to my doctor or myself. I was a statistical oddity.  Go you for going into it with eyes open. I love it when patients are their own advocates and know what takes to get the best outcomes and are willing to do it. Sorry to hear you had complications. So would you recommend doing gastric bypass to a friend? Even with the complications? Did you try diet and exercise first? What kind of workout do you do now? What kind of diet? Never talked with anyone that went through with it so I am just curious. Won't be offended if you don't want to answer. You look fantastic and I like the brown better than the black, it is a softer look. As for my current diet and workout routine, I am able to eat anything I want in very small quantities. My pouch is about 1 oz so I take I'm only 500-1000 calorie per day. I drink coffee and get to have treats when I want but mostly I stick to vegetables and protein.(Fruit has many sugars). I workout a minimum of 5 days a week at least an hour a day. I do various workouts, but my last night without was 20 minutes(2.7 miles) on the stationary cycle, 75 decline crunches, 50 leg presses with 75 pounds resistance, 25 body weight squats, 10 minutes on the stair stepper, and 20 minutes of yoga. \n\nAlso, the only nutrient I need to regulate since my surgery is B-12. I have a ton if people who think I'm all sorts of nutrient difficent, which, is simply not the case. I take a under tongue dissolving B-12 tablet along with my regular and prior to surgery supplements of a daily vitamin, iron, calcium, omega, ginger root, BC and prime rose extract. Is the B-12 management due to the surgery? Will you have to do that and always take supplement for eternity?   Is the B-12 management due to the surgery? Will you have to do that and always take supplement for eternity?   Keep in mind this isn't with all weight loss surgery, just the roux n y bypass.  Of course, thanks for answering my questions. I love hearing about first hand experiences. Yes, I had gastric bypass surgery with great results but numerous small issues, that, when added together nearly killed me a few times. I spent a couple weeks (almost 6) hospitalized and was sent on home care with a picc line for the next 3 months.

My depression has lessened immensely, I have more energy and I'm happier knowing I can Live a healthier life. you have done so well this is amazing :)\n\nI have a friend that had similar surgery although I think just gastric banding not actually removing any stomach.\n\nanyway she never tried before to lose weight and just wanted a miracle cure, I have no idea how the surgery managed to get approved, and afterwards she never lost a single pound because she just constantly drank high calorie liquids (starbucks, frappes) or ate the same shit but just slower as if THAT was the answer????\n\nShe seriously tarnished my opinion of people who get weight loss surgery but I love hearing stories like yours that are much more positive :)\n I get a lot of negativity. People assume I wad merely to lazy or lacked Motivation which was not my situation. I didn't do this to look better i did it to be healthy. I appreciate you listening to my story so many people make assumptions that are simply untrue. Its a shame that society really places a lot of focus on weight loss as a vain/selfish thing rather than a health thing. \n\neven the opposite way where people say \"curves are sexy\" yes they are, curves are, extreme excess weight, diseases and health issues are not. I get a lot of negativity. People assume I wad merely to lazy or lacked Motivation which was not my situation. I didn't do this to look better i did it to be healthy. I appreciate you listening to my story so many people make assumptions that are simply untrue. I read an article about this type of surgery a while back that convinced me that it was not exactly an easy out. (As if any serious surgery would be...!) I know the recovery period is really difficult, but it sounds like you are handling it really well! \n\nI'm also gonna join the others in saying that your hair is great. :)  Do you do anything to your eyebrows? If so, I need to know because I think you hold the secret to my perfect eyebrows.\n\nAlso, your weight loss is awesome, but your eyebrows! I am sorry all I care about are your awesome eyebrows, but they are seriously pretty.  I love looking at progress pics and clicking the first one and it's already a wonderfully gorgeous girl, because I just think as I scroll through, \"Man... this is gonna be good!\"  You're doing good :) \n\nAnd.. I honestly like the last pic, the one from today the best. The face looks so different. I have a real hard time believing that that's the same person across all those pictures, because of how radically different that last face is from the others. \n  Congrats :) you look great!  Boobs. Also guuuuurl, you are fabulous.  You look fantastic! So happy for you!! And your hair is spectacular. I also went from blonde to black to brown to blonde again. It's no big deal with a good colorist, but may I recommend an overnight repair treatment? Loreal Everpure makes a great one that you can put on once or twice a week and it will help your hair recover from the processing. Just in case you find you need it. \n\nOnce again, CONGRATULATIONS!!   This is amazing. Congratulations!  ",

    "title" : "My Abortion Story",
    "snippet" : "Hello,\n\nI'm one of your mods here at TwoX and I'm choosing to share my story about my abortion and a little about my personal life. I looked for abortion stories but had a hard time finding them. The one by 'leggomypreggo' really hit home with me and I decided to speak up. Because there was nothing immoral or wrong in what I did.\n\nI'm 27, a recovering alcoholic and recovering from eating disorders. I'm in a loving relationship with the man I want to marry and we live together. \n\nI found out I was pregnant mid-January. My breasts were massive (ok, bigger than my A-cup) and my nipples were darker and bigger than usual. Very weird. So I was at the gym one day and decided hey fuck it, I'll buy some tests.\n\nThis pregnancy is a result of my poor planning, which is a result of my ongoing issues with caring for myself. I forgot to get my birth control shot. Something I rarely do. I thought the date was January 3rd (it was actually in December).\n\nI took a test at the gym, and it was inconclusive. Meaning, it was a dud. I went home, and took another one. Jokingly saying to my boyfriend, \"Hey I'm going to see if we're pregnant\". Chilled on reddit, went back to check, holy shit. That was Sunday.\n\nI was absolutely shell shocked. I knew how, and why, but holy shit. I thought that years of poisoning my body with alcohol, that years of taking depo, would have meant years of trying to get pregnant. But here I was, pregnant.\n\nMy boyfriend immediately didn't want the baby. I did. It felt right. I felt like I had purpose. I felt like I had something to take care of. \n\nWe thought about it for a week. I was told by my psychologist that it was okay to be \"pre-decision\" about it. I took a week off. Which is almost a month off now, I go to work once in awhile. But I found it overwhelming.\n\nOn the 28th, I made an appointment with the Morgentaler clinic. Their next appointment was February 14th. Valentines Day. Hilarious. I was just getting things lined up. I didn't know what I wanted to do. My boyfriend said if I decided to keep the baby, we would. \n\nI literally went back and forth so many times. Check my post history and you'll see how divided I was. \n\nOn January 31st, I had my first appointment with my doctor for a prenatal. I wanted to do the right things incase we went through with the pregnancy. The next day I had my first morning sickness, and it didn't stop until today (abortion was yesterday, the 14th). It was brutal. I missed work, had no energy, had crazy mood swings, the whole nine yards.\n\nWhat made me decide to have the abortion? I realized that I was doing it for the wrong reasons. I mentioned earlier how I felt like I was finally taking care of something, I had a purpose. But, I have a purpose. And I have something to take care of: myself. And my purpose, my career path, that's all still unrealized. I spent my 20's in a drunken haze. I've been sober almost 21 months, but still haven't even begun to live the life I want to live, be the woman I want to be. \n\nI had a choice, and I chose myself and my relationships.\n\nThe abortion was scary. I wasn't allowed to eat before, and my appointment was at 1pm. I went to the gym in the morning to do a light workout, and drank a bunch of apple juice. Packed a little lunch. Boyfriend drove us downtown. The clinic was...amazing. I can't tell you how comfortable I felt. The guy at the front desk knew how nervous I was and immediately told me that these guys were the best. \n\nI filled out paperwork, answered routine questions. Then I went to see their intake worker, who basically just gave me something to read and then I waited again to see the counsellor. She asked me about my decision, about what form of birth control I was going to use, answered all my questions, and calmed me down. \n\nThen I waited a bit longer, and was called into ' THE BACK '. I was told to bring a long sweater and a robe and slippers. So I was asked to strip down everything under my waist. Bunch of ladies were all sitting in the same room, waiting for the same procedure. We were sisters.\n\nI saw a nurse, who confirmed the pregnancy. I asked to see the fetus. 9.5 weeks. I was farther along than I thought. Decision remains. I saw the little fetus. I can't wait to have another one sooner or later. Just not now.\n\nThe actual procedure was painful. I didn't take any narcotics because I am a recovering addict/alcoholic and didn't want any sobriety issues. It lasted a few minutes. Intense pressure and poking sensations. A nurse was right beside me the entire time. It was over very quickly. I looked at the aspirator and saw the little bag of blood, and that was my fetus.\n\nI walked to the aftercare room, they gave me a heating pad and some crackers and ginger ale. All the other girls were there and we were chatty about how it went and just supported each other. The nurse was amazing. I stayed therefor 15 minutes, then got dressed, walked out to see my boyfriend and left. \n\nWhole thing took 1.5 hours. I was in pain for the rest of the day but mostly I was just emotionally...dead. We called the fetus, Lima Bean. And I was shocked it was gone. I had a warm home for it, and now it was in the garbage somewhere.\n\nI read somewhere that the opposite of death is not life, it's birth. That being said, I am not sure if I ever had life inside of me. But she felt real. I feel empty today. And I know there is no right decision, there is no perfect healing process. But I feel...empty. My lima bean is gone. Anyways that's my story.    I went through with an abortion this past November. I don't regret the decision I made, as hard as it was. I do have days of overwhelming sadness, every once in a while, that things couldn't have been different. Anyway, I can't claim to know how you feel, but I can offer huge hugs from one internet stranger to another. The important thing is to take care of *you*. And if you ever need to talk to anyone about it, I'm always here.              Thank you for sharing. I went through quite a similar experience last year. I can really identify with what you said about the clinic being wonderful. I try to explain to my close friends that the actual experience of going to the clinic was *positive*; not because I wanted to get rid of the baby that badly but because the nurses and technicians were wonderful, comforting yet straight forward people.\nEven though before I found out I was pregnant I already knew I would have an abortion, and even though I feel the same way now, it was still one of the hardest decisions of my life. But I know I made the right choice, and I'm glad I did (and had the right to).\nThank you for posting this because I think its really important for young women to understand what going through it is like. Yeah I had always said I'd get an abortion if I got pregnant before I was ready. But it was more than that, I thought my initial reaction to the pregnancy would be \"holy shit get this thing out of me, let's get on the waitlist for an abortion\"\n\nBut I really struggled with the decision, I was very attached to the fetus/baby whatever. And I  was confused I wasn't having the \"i'm in charge of my body\" reaction. I thought it made me less of a \"strong\" woman. \n\nThis whole experience had been very existential.    Love you, VE.\n\n{{hugs}}    This makes me curious.  I'm pro-choice but have never been in this situation--why did you name your fetus? \n\nI feel like naming it brings it closer to \"baby\" than \"not baby\" This makes me curious.  I'm pro-choice but have never been in this situation--why did you name your fetus? \n\nI feel like naming it brings it closer to \"baby\" than \"not baby\"",

    "title" : "Any TwoX NYCers able to recommend a salon for hair extensions?",
    "snippet" : "Yes, yes, I know, this is more suited for /r/FancyFollicles, but I've done my research there and it looks like i need to hit a wider audience. \n\nI've checked yelp, etc., and went to my own salon today... did the numbers and holy crap it's going to run me about $1,000 for a process that will last four months at the outset. That's depressing.\n\nIs there anyone here who has experience getting microbead extensions in the city and can recommend a place?  Uhhh that's the running cost for microbead extensions (in a city, at a reputable salon) as far as I know, for consultation, product + labor?  I wouldn't trust getting it done for much less than that.  :\\  \n\nAlso personally I don't think they grow out very nicely at all, you might be better off with sew-in or clip-in extensions, less expensive and won't damage your hair so much. I looked into clip-ins, they're definitely less expensive but I'm worried about blending in.\n\nThanks for the info on pricing, though! I didn't disbelieve my stylist when she told me, I was just wondering if there were better alternates out there. I was working at a high end salon and my boss was the first in the state to learn microbead extensions when they came out.  She came back from an expo after having had them done and we were all majorly impressed!   But then her hair was a hot mess after ~6 months, and she was in total denial, I thought they did her more harm than good tbh!  They were so heavy too.  I've seen plenty of good extensions in my day that were clip-ins, honestly you can go into a good salon and ask for help, most likely a stylist can teach you how to make the most of them, can cut or curl them to suit you better, even dye some extensions to better match your hair.  Once you damage your hair it's a pain in the ass game of catch-up to fix.  What city? When I got mine done I paid 500 and they lasted nearly a year (with occasional colour touch ups and such, which was about 30 dollars each time) ",

    "snippet" : "So I was eating breakfast and reading an online version of one of the biggest Norwegian newspapers this morning, and I'm just so annoyed with this that I had to get it out somewhere. I skimmed through the article - written by a well-known comedian - it was about how \"Norwegian men are the most feminine men in the world\", according to him, I suppose. (here is the link, if you want to look, google translate wouldn't translate it for some reason http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/02/15/kultur/debatt/debattinnlegg/feminisme/25783407/) Then I got to the comment section! By the way, they operate with a downvote and upvote system, much like reddit.\n\n*\"I can't imagine feminists will stop nagging about equality untill every man is laying castrated in a mass grave, bleeding to death.\"*\n\n**36** upvotes, 2 downvotes\n\n*\"Except for things that have to do with reproduction, women are simply incredibly boring people. That's just the way it is.\"*\n\n**30** upvotes, 2 downvotes.\n\n*\"In Russia and eastern Europe, men are still men and women are women, they're like what we were in the fifties. Norwegian girls look like trolls, there's a reason all Bond-women are from Russia\"*\n\n11 upvotes, zero downvotes\n\nTop comment: *\"Norwegian men have been reduced to politically correct, meterosexual, easily controllable children, almost without exception\"* (Not true, men here are like men in most other western countries. What does he want? To never have to pick up his kids from preschool? To never have to cook? Is that too \"meterosexual\"? I don't get it).\n\n**117** upvotes, 1 downvote\n\nWhat is going on with these people? Why do they hate their own gender *and* women so much? What kind of deep set issues are these comments a symptom of? I really hope they are all angry 12-year-olds who will become decent human beings in a few years, but I suppose they're more likely adults. Does a substantial part of the people around us really think and mean these things? When people write hateful things like this on reddit, it will at least get downvoted into a dark hole in the ground, but these comments get *upvotes* D:\n\nI am going to take my own advice and not read these things anymore, it was just so unnerving and shocking I had to get it out there.  &gt;\"I can't imagine feminists will stop nagging about equality untill every man is laying castrated in a mass grave, bleeding to death.\"\n\nOMG HOW DID HE FIND OUT? WHO TOLD?!?!? /s\n\nLike bitterpiller wrote, these sorts of comments unfortunately crop up anywhere misogynists have opportunity and anonymity.  Ugh, it would be so bizarre to see one of these people and see that they probably look somewhat normal and inconspicuous. They totally do. I went out with some friends a few nights ago and was introduced to a seemingly nice guy. A little while later he sent me a friend request on facebook. So I decided to take a look at his profile before accepting, and very prominently he announced that he \"hates feminism.\"\n\nMade me stop dead in my tracks. Who hates a movement for the equal rights and treatment of women? \n\nDid not accept that friend request.\n\nRight now he's probably still whinging about how some evil feminist shot him down.  So, so, so many people don't know what it's about, and I kind of get that, but.. aah, these people are so hateful! [deleted]      \"Women are incredibly boring\"\n\nThis isnt neccesarily untrue. It scholariy supported. Read \"why women arent funny\". By christopher hitchens. You can google it lol. That is not a scholarly article. It's just a Hitchens rant.

Not to mention, hurrah, victim-blaming! Grow up and think before you leave a comment to someone who might be in a shitty mindset right now. Think about how YOU would feel if someone responded to you in this way. I am assuming you are referring to me. You have a valid point, yes she didn't leave much information, so all we are seeing is her being hostile towards her ex (saving ingredients for months to make for this special day with a rude message on it). It's not clever, it's not cute, and it accomplished nothing to restore her feelings. She's not any better about the break up, she just made an attack on a guy who may or may not have deserved it. Someone is not a dick because they break up with you, and posts like this make me ashamed of some people here. If you read through the comments, no one has insulted her. Saying someone is acting immature, does not imply they are immature, rather there action is. They way she is handling this is an expression on how she handles conflict, in her relationship also. I see no response here that indicates anyone was out of line. Though there is some harsh opinions, it does not mean they are untrue. With a conflict she had further down, she all of a sudden says she's depressed and will kill herself over it. No, that is not appropriate. That is an attempt of an emotional attack to some stranger on the net. There is no victim blaming as there is no victim. How are you even getting victim blaming out of this? Based of the information she gave us, her obvious need to seek revenge on him, but her conflicted posts about there history (that she misses) makes this whole thing childish. They haven't had any contact in 2 weeks. He's not doing anything to her, but she is placing attacking like this behind his back (which he is on reddit and may see) and if the roles were reverse, OP would clearly be devastated. \n\nIf someone left a perfectly rational comment to me, even if I was in the worse mindset, I would either ignore it, or realize I am to fragile to deal with that kind of thing, and remove the content. It's not like this post has any revelance, besides to prove Chris, op's ex, is an apparent dick. She is the one doing the name calling here, and if you honestly think it's alright for her to attack her ex, when he has done nothing to her for at least 2 weeks (and was apperently good to her in the relationship) then by all means.  Kinda looks like it says Fuck You China, i was really confused until I read the title lol. But yay brownies :D    Wait.. You bought supplies to make brownies a month in advance and you didn't make brownies while waiting?   This is very immature and insulting even on your behalf. If he was such a dick, why were you with him? I am assuming you were happy and care free while with him, so why the hostility now? Because he broke up with you? That's childish. People break up with people when the relationship has run it's course, and on his end it clearly did. This is not \"clever\" or \"cute\" it's moderately disturbing. You kept supplies for months, and baked these brownies with this message? That's so hostile. If he posted a photo of a cake he made that said \"-insert name- is a bitch\" you would probably get very upset. If your history was so good, remember the good times, and let the rest go. This makes you look like a fool, and I have a hunch the trouble was not him, but you, since this is the way you act, thinking it's an appropriate and mature way to deal with such a thing. You are celebrating your break up, while it apperently still hurts you and while you are holding on to it? Makes no sense. You are really making him seem like he made the right move.

I ate them with my friends. This was my first time having my heart broken, out of nowhere even. He made weekend plans with me a few hours before. He was telling me a few days before how I'm such an awesome girlfriend. I'm only 20. I've been depressed for a good month and cried every day this week. You want to keep putting me down? Fine. Whatever. Shit on me like the whole world has been the past 4 weeks of my life. [deleted] [deleted] I really don't need a dick on the Internet making me feel like this. I've been contemplating suicide several times and seeing a counselor and this is just not what I need. I know there are people who face worse shit than me but you have no idea about my life, and how I feel. You have no idea about me or my ex or our relationship. I thought TwoX was supportive but I've never received this much hate from here before. I did this one act to get out my anger and I just get shat on. I'm so tired of this.

    "title" : "Hey twox, could you help me articulate an argument for fair wages with my employer?",
    "snippet" : "So I work as a server in a restaurant part time (I have another full time job, but this lady has student loans). All the servers are women, all the people who work in the back of house and all the owners are men. Hence why I think this question might belong here. \n\nNormally, on a busy night, we have a hostess. I pay out of my tips at the end of the night 12% to the hostess and 5% to the kitchen. So if I make $150 in tips, $18 goes to the hostess and $8 goes to the kitchen, leaving me with $124. \n\nLately, weeknights have been slow, so we don't have a hostess at all. At first, that was fine. I will meet and greet, seat and get water and bread for my tables in addition to waiting on them. But in the last two weeks, my employer (a man who calls me, 'babe' and grabs my waist on a regular basis) has started tipping the kitchen 10% on these nights, since \"there's no hostess so that's only fair\". \n\nBy my math, he's saying that on a night with no hostess, the kitchen works 5% harder and a server only works 2% harder, which is completely backwards. The kitchen doesn't notice any difference whatsoever except that tickets might come in a little slower since I'm working two positions at once. \n\nHow can I articulate this to my employer (like I said, a very 'lady's man' kind of guy' to get the pay that I think is fair without jeopardizing my position as lowly server in a restaurant?   I think you should look at your math and notice how much cash you're getting than the kitchen already.  Those folks work just as hard as waitstaff or harder and don't get nearly as many tips.  I think $124 a night is a good haul on top of a minimum wage salary for a part-time worker.\n\nI think it sucks that you have to work with a pervy manager, and that should be the first thing that you need to change there.  How easily can you go over his head? &gt;I think $124 a night is a good haul on top of a minimum wage salary for a part-time worker.\n\nI'm not sure that she is a \"minimum wage\" worker. Usually restaurants can pay their wait staff significantly below minimum wage as long as they make at least minimum wage once the tips they earn are included. For example, the federal minimum wage is $7.25, but the \"tipped employee\" minimum wage is $2.13. Of course the specific state that the poster resides in will effect what the minimum wage is. \n\nThe chef/cooks are not customarily considered tipped employees, so regular minimum wage applies to them. Thus, if she is having to tip out people who already are making $3+ an hour more then there might be reason for complaint.  &gt;I think $124 a night is a good haul on top of a minimum wage salary for a part-time worker.\n\nI'm not sure that she is a \"minimum wage\" worker.

How easily can you go over his head? &gt;I think you should look at your math...\n\nOkay.\n\nKitchen staff tends to be paid a straight wage which is typically *much* higher than the wage paid to the wait staff.  To wit, when I waited tables, we got $2.13 per hour + tips and the kitchen guys got $12 an hour.\n\nThat means *even when the restaurant is dead inside* and the kitchen guys aren't making any meals—they still get $12 per hour.  If you're a waiter, however, you're probably cleaning a bunch of random stuff over and over again for $2.13 an hour.\n\nYou have to put in enough time at the slow shifts to \"earn\" being able to work on a weekend in a lot of places.  During these slow shifts, you can expect to take home $40 after 6 hours of pointlessness.  The kitchen guys will take home $72.\n\nSo, when a busy night comes around, and after you've earned less than the minimum wage all week to clean things, you'll make up to a couple hundred dollars for four hours worth of work.  That much is true.  But a lot of that money is necessary just to drag your average wage above minimum.  The guys in the kitchen are spared of that nonsense.\n\nNot to mention, what kind of bullshit pyramid scheme makes one group of employees pay the other group for simply doing their job?  OP mentions that on *slow* nights, her boss makes her tip the kitchen 10% instead of 5% because there isn't a hostess.  A hostess gets *12%*.  \n\nThat means that on her busiest nights, when she's working her hardest and is *finally* earning a wage that isn't at conflict with the federally-mandated minimum; she will lose 17% of her income to her employer.\n\nIsn't her employer responsible for paying her coworkers?  Why is she stuck with *any* percentage?  Sometimes the argument in return is that 'the tips don't just belong to her they belong to the whole crew.  She just happens to be the one to collect them.'  That, however, is a flawed argument because her wage is typically the only wage that is explicitly dependent on tips.  This observation has even been codified as one of a few exceptions to the federally mandated minimum wage that an employer must pay their employees.  Restaurants only have to pay servers $2.13 an hour because even the federal government understands that a server's income is based off of tips.  If a restaurant meant to have the kitchen staff's wages dependent on tips wouldn't the restaurant pay the kitchen $2.13 an hour as well?  \n\nFurthermore, the kitchen staff is paid out of the money that the restaurant charges for its meals and drinks.  Restaurants charge more for their meals than the aggregated prices of all of the component ingredients precisely because they also have overhead.  That's how it keeps its doors open—by selling meals.  Kitchen and staff are part of that overhead.    \n\nTips, however, are above and beyond the price of the meal.  The diner is only *required* to pay for the meal.  They may elect *not* to tip the waiter at all.  If you walk out of a restaurant without paying for the meal; you can be arrested and charged for \"theft of services.\"  Tips, however, have been found to be [discretionary](http://news.myway.com/odd/article/id/427484%7Coddlyenough%7C09-16-2004::09:27%7Creuters.html) which indicates that even the law recognizes that restaurants operate out of different money than that which pays its servers. \n\nThere's also another point to be made here.  The man arrested in the article was charged with \"theft of services\" after not tipping.  He was cleared of those charges after the DA determined that tipping is discretionary.  It was the restaurant owner that called the police.  This implies that the restaurant has no right to ownership over any tips that are or are not collected.  Again, even the federal government recognizes this by creating an *exemption* from the federally mandated minimum wage.  By allowing a restaurant to pay a server only $2.13 an hour—the federal government is basically saying that it recognizes that servers make their money from a different revenue stream within the establishment.  Specifically, the federal government allows the restaurant to deduct all but $2.13 an hour, per server, from their overhead.  \n \nSo what right does her boss have to tell her to pay her coworkers? It's not his nor the restaurant's money.\n\nNot to mention, the jump from 5% to 10% is a 100% increase in their share of any tip money collected.  This is for *less* effort than usual so the increase isn't even part of some sort of compensation or reward for working really well during a stressful and busy dining window.  The boss's stated reasoning that \"there's no hostess so that's only fair\" indicates that his understanding of who actually owns any tips collected is incorrect.  He thinks that they belong to the whole restaurant but we both now know that that isn't true.\n\nLong story short, it doesn't matter if you think $124.00 is a good haul or not.  That isn't the relevant argument.\n\nAnd OP, you have your argument here but you'll waste it in a restaurant.  Restaurants suck to work in and the kind of scheme you're describing is common.  Common enough that if you complain about it too much you'll end up fired because waiters are a dime a dozen.       \n             \n\n   &gt;The man arrested in the article was charged with \"theft of services\" after not tipping.\n\nWhat article are you referencing?\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the average wage (including tips) for a waiter is often more than the average wage for a cook, even though cooking is a skilled profession and waiting is not.  Her position also relies on the cook's services, so the cook should get paid more.  If she doesn't like the way the money is distributed, she's free to work in another industry.\n\nShe's making a decent wage for her skill level and hours worked, and she doesn't have much of a case to ask for a raise.  She does have a right to not be sexually harassed though, which is the bigger issue in this case, IMHO. The article is the link in my response. \n\n&gt;When it comes down to it, the average wage (including tips) for a waiter is often more than the average wage for a cook, even though cooking is a skilled profession and waiting is not. Her position also relies on the cook's services, so the cook should get paid more.\n\nNone of that matters.  If the cook is worth more money then the *restaurant* needs to pay them more.  I would argue that since there is no shortage of cooks that the pay is appropriate. \n\nFurthermore, it isn't *her* who relies on the cook's services it is the *restaurant* which relies on *both* of their services to bring their product to the market.    \n\n&gt;If she doesn't like the way the money is distributed, she's free to work in another industry.\n\nThat isn't what she's asking.  \n\n&gt;She's making a decent wage for her skill level and hours worked\n\nThat's your opinion.  I'm not here to divulge opinions.  She asked for an argument for \"fair wages\" but the issue really lies in the practice of forcing her to distribute her rightful income to her coworkers.  \n\n&gt;and she doesn't have much of a case to ask for a raise\n\nGetting to keep *all* of your rightful income isn't asking for a raise.  Her employer is ordering her to use money that belongs to her—and is indeed paid out to her *specifically* and in a discretionary manner—to subsidize the paychecks of her coworkers.  Name other industries that make you do that.\n\n        &gt; Name other industries that make you do that.\n\nReal Estate, stripping, any sales by commission job that requires an outlay of your own expenses to make a profit. Except that in those cases, at least for real estate and sales jobs—you *keep* your commission.  I don't know about stripping.\n\nYou should go back and actually read my response.  In it you'll find the argument that I'm *actually* making.   I read your response, but it seems to be more of a critique of the restaurant industry than an answer to her question.  I've worked in the hospitality industry, and while it sucks to have to give the kitchen and hosts a portion of your tips, in the places I worked, it was up to the waiter how much that was.  This system, of course, is worse for the hosts and kitchen, who have to rely on the generosity of the waiter for their portion.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I don't view the hospitality industry like a standard manufacturing job.  It's hard for the owner to make a shit ton of money off of marking up the food sufficient to pay for staff, which is why I consider the staff positions, especially the waitstaff, to be a bit of a commission type job.  If they are friendly, can upsell the customer and get repeat customers, they are adding directly to their own bottom line in terms of percentages.  The wage they get paid by the restaurant partially offsets the risks of working slow nights.\n\nIf you want to change the system, the way to do it is by opening a business of your own and operating it the way you see fit or attempting to change legislation.  The whole system is not going to disappear because one waitress made a strong argument to her employer about the injustice of the current system and got a raise.\n\nSo while I agree the system is unfair, I don't think she's in a position to change it, especially since she is well-compensated for her efforts already. I think you should look at your math and notice how much cash you're getting than the kitchen already.  Those folks work just as hard as waitstaff or harder and don't get nearly as many tips.  I think $124 a night is a good haul on top of a minimum wage salary for a part-time worker.\n\nI think it sucks that you have to work with a pervy manager, and that should be the first thing that you need to change there.  How easily can you go over his head?   Waitresses make more than cooks almost all of the time. Those guys would love to have your take home pay. Most places don't tip the kitchen at all, meaning they get screwed by a busy night, extra work with no extra pay while the waitresses also work extra hard but have a fat roll of cash at the end if the day. You should be happy to tip out your cooks, those guys determine the quality and speed of the food coming out, your tips are half based on their performance.   ",

He's going off to college for two years, and I'm going to be here, stuck in high school. We will only see each other about 2 weeks out of the 2 years he is gone. I'm really worried about what is to come, because all of my free time is spent with him. When we started dating, I slowly started seeing other friends less and less and now, hardly at all. I'm going to feel so alone... \n\nShould we try the long distance thing? \n\nIs it okay for me to go to parties without him when hes gone?\n\nWill a temporary \"break\" mess up what we have? \n\nShould I be worried about him doing things with other girls?\n\nHow do I get my friends back if they feel like I abandoned them? \n\nLadies of two x, if you have any kind of experience with this, please share! I'm so anxious I can hardly bare it.     \"Amor de lejos es amor de pendejos.\"  Wise Spanish saying that means \"Long-distance relationships are for really stupid people.\"  \n\nYou have two choices:\n1) End it when he moves away (or sooner).\n2) Get dumped.  \nI'm sorry.  If you are crazy about someone the last thing you would do is find a college as far away from a loved one as possible. \nDon't waste 2 years of your life. And if you find another b/f don't ditch your mates, boyfriends /girlfriends come and go, good friends last a lifetime.

And if you find another b/f don't ditch your mates, boyfriends /girlfriends come and go, good friends last a lifetime.  Not...really. I would never ask my SO to give up an opportunity just to be with me. If their dream school was across the country, I would feel guilty for the rest of my life if they gave that up for me. I want my SO to love their life and never feel held back by me.   It's 100% doable if you're both truly, honestly in love. A friend of mine has been dating a boy halfway across the world for almost 3 years now. They've only spent maybe 3 weeks together total in that time frame. Granted, it's probably easier for them because they never went through that phase of spending a ton of time together (they met online), and maybe their personalities are just better suited for it, but they don't seem to struggle with it too much. I know another girl who's dating a boy in England and they both also seem very happy. In both cases, both couples seem truly in love, and long distance is an inconvenience for them rather than a dealbreaker.    I'm sure if you sit and think long enough you'll know what you want to do.  \nA long distance relationship takes a lot of trust,  and can be done only if you two are completely comfortable with the other person and able to give them 100% freedom.  That means he's got to trust you too.\n      The saying \"if you love something let it go...\" holds true. That being said, be aware of the possibility that you're at an age where people's ideas, goals, and interests change.  You might wake up and decide he's not what you want anymore; the same goes for him, and that's okay! Just remember that you're asking just as much from him as he is from you.  If you both sit and talk about it and you decide to give it a shot, I applaud you for being brave enough to trust him, yourself, and sticking the middle finger up to anyone who tries to tell you how \"that's just how it is\".  and if you decide to break it off,  I still am proud that you are strong enough to make a clean decisive break and move toward what you want.\n      Both choices are a chance to grow, to learn, and to become a stronger person.

Generally speaking if I am off it's only by one day at the most.\n\nI only had cramps the first day and the bleeding only lasted just over 48 hours. My periods usually last five days. There were no clots in the blood and it was very light, but heavy enough to keep a pad on just in case.\n\nI do have sex regularly with my S/O. I don't want to say anything to him until I am absolutely positive that it seriously could be pregnancy - we've had one scare andone miscarriage before and I don't want to bring the drama back again until I'm absolutely positive.\n\nThe last day the bleeding tapered off and went from bright red (my period blood is usually more brown) to light pink that ONLY showed up on tissue paper.\n\nIs it time for me to grab a test or is this just something weird that happens sometimes? It's never happened to me and I'm a bit nervous.\n\n**tl;dr;** very light bleeding, from bright red to light pink, less than 3 days, minimal cramping (and only on the first day) and extremely light flow, no clots. Could I be pregnant?  Have you been hanging out with any new girls? New coworkers? New sports group? When I first started my job, I skipped a month and then started on their cycle. After I got in sync with them for several months, my period was a couple of weeks late only to now be matched up to my new volleyball team.  Even women with the most regular periods will once in a while have some weird ones. Honestly don't worry about it sometimes it just happens. Think about it like somedays you wake up with a pain in your side no reall reason why you have it you just have it. But you don't panic about it until it lasts for a week or two, same thing here. Stress, diet, exercise,etc can all effect our periods, a long with a lot of other things. Unless your next period is like this or you miss the period I wouldn't even worry. However with that being said if you are still uneasy just grab a test. No harm in checking if it puts your mind at ease.   Periods can totally go awry/change for the most mundane of reasons, so this most likely doesn't mean anything. But, for your peace of mind, taking a pregnancy test in the next week or so would probably be for the best.  ",

    "title" : "I'm tired of the mentality that because I'm disabled, love is a privilege and that I'm obligated to return that love, because \"I just want to see you happy\".",
    "snippet" : "I'm disabled. I'm not going to go into specifics about my disability, because it doesn't matter. What I'm about to say, does.\n\nAs a disabled woman (actually, not even that - I'm genderqueer but erasure of my gender identity is a different subject for a different forum), it's been pretty much ingrained into my head that for me, love is a privliege. Meaning, if someone shows attention towards me or \"loves\" me, that I should accept it, because that might be the best I get, even if I don't want any part of it.\n\nUnder the guise of \"I just want you to be happy\", I was pushed into a relationship that ignored both my gender and sexual identity. The man I was in a relationship with had no concept of boundaries, was a snoop, rude and disrespectful and tried to bribe me for sex (which I declined). When I told people about what was happening, my experiences were denied -- it wasn't \"that bad\" and told without saying it explicitly that at least they were male and wanted a relationship with me.\n\nI ended the relationship, but not without resistance. It took him pissing off my mother (about something disability-related) for her to understand why I ended it.\n\nI do not blame my family for what happened because I see this as part of a larger trend - if you have a son or dsughter with a disability, if someone shows interest in them you want them paired off because it's *normal*. It doesn't matter who and what they are, it's a slice of Normal and that's a privilege and we need to Accept this, no matter the consenquences (because nobody else will like or want us). It's mis- and dis- information.\n\nSo my question: Why are women with disabilities taught that being loved by those outside of their family is a privilege/chore and to accept the \"love\" of whatever comes their way?  Correct me if I'm wrong, or dispute if you disagree, but... I think it has an awful lot to do with the fact that a fair proportion of non-disabled people see disabled people as pitiable. They don't see them as normal human beings so in turn when they see a disabled person engage in normal social behaviour (like having a relationship), these people think it's a privilege; that the disabled person is lucky to be able to participate in society in such a way because they're not a \"normal\" person. It's important to note that these people don't necessarily have bad intentions, a lot of them have good intentions that are misplaced or misinformed. Case in point: your family pressuring you to stay in a relationship with any guy who comes along unconditionally; they think this way because they want you to be happy but they're assuming that because you're disabled, you're generally unlovable to anyone who doesn't \"have\" to love you (i.e. family). If by some amazing chance someone shows interest in you *\"despite\"* the fact that you're disabled, you have to do whatever it takes to stay with that person because they are doing incredible charity just by being in a relationship with you. Of course, this is fucking bullshit, regardless of whether you're disabeld or not, genderqueer or cis, black or white or whatever, if a romantic partner disrespects you you have every right to dump them. Telling someone otherwise is telling them that they don't deserve respect. On that note, kudos to you for standing up for yourself and dumping that guy's ass. Admitting that there are fundamental flaws in the relationship and making the decision to break up is tough for everybody, you sound like you handled it like a champ so go you :)\n\n   I am going to sound like a dick here, however it's not my mentality. But people see disabled people as weaker, desperate, and dependant. Which is not true. So I guess it comes down to people thinking \"beggars can't be choosers\" but that is so far from the truth. No matter how disabled, physically, or mentally, they still have a preference, things they like, things they dislike, what they find attractive, and they entitled to go for what they really want! They are not \"beggars.\" It really does bother me when people think they should \"take what they get.\"    My spouse is genderqueer and I'm trans, so lemme tell ya, I can totally dig the irritation at having one's gender identity ignored and outright ridiculed. \n\nOn the disability thing, I really have no advice, all I can really say is that dude was a douche and your family/friends should be more aware. You are not obligated to do a darn thing, especially in regards to relationships. \n\nOnto your question! I've often seen that mentality about anyone who has disabilities. The stigma against physical and mental handicaps is absolutely mind boggling, and it's like even the thought of trying to teach people that disabled people are (shock and surprise!) just people who want love and hey, maybe even want sex! is just this completely unapproachable thing. It's ridiculous. It might help to sit your family down and talk to them about respectable boundaries when it comes to *your* love life.  I no longer involve my family in my romantic relationships. They know I have a partner, but there is no room for discussion or criticism. I'll walk out. It's my life, my heart, my body. I will not be judged, shamed, or erased. They know this.  After my car accident my sister finds it necessary to compliment my partner everytime she sees him for staying with me and taking care of me.. And I am not even that disabled (back-neck damaged, less mobile). It annoys me to no end.. Like he is some hero for staying with me just because I am a little less mobile and need a little more help. I love my partner, he loves me. And we both help each other.. It's just ridiculous...   Fist bump for genderqueer! :)\n\nI don't feel that I fall into the same category as you, let alone deal with the same difficulties as you do, because my disability is invisible and generally allows me to \"pass\" to other people. I have gotten similar feelings from my mother though, when I was younger. She flat out admitted to me that she once thought I would never be able to get through a job interview, let alone date someone, and she *despaired* over it.\n\nI'm sorry you had to experience that abuse and such head-in-the-sand reactions from those around you. *offers hugs?* Fist bump for genderqueer! :)\n\nI don't feel that I fall into the same category as you, let alone deal with the same difficulties as you do, because my disability is invisible and generally allows me to \"pass\" to other people.

    "title" : "Why live if he's just going to kill me?",
    "snippet" : "**edit** thank you all so much, you ladies are so incredible. I feel a strange love sensation towards you all. When I was awoken this morning, I will filled with a rage. A rage that pulsed throu every fiber of my being and it is pushing me. 'joe' was out all night doing drugs, not letting me know where he was, blowing the little money we have. He has yet to come home, but when he does, he will be coming down, detoxing, and mad. Really angry, and aggressive. I know this cycle, he will beat me today. BUT NO. NOT TODAY. I called my best friend, who I haven't spoken to in over two years. I will be staying with her two states over. I love you all. I'll bring my laptop and update you as soon as I'm out. Got to run- literally. You all rock. \n\n\n\nTo start, thank you for reading this. It's going to be a long post. please bare with me, because I don't know where else to turn, or how to deal with this. I will make no excuses for my actions. They have been weak and selfish. I do, however, believe it has something to do with my childhood.\n\n My childhood was 18 years of exetreme mental, physical, and emotional abuse, and 15 years of sexual abuse by my father. In the midst of this, I met a boy (I'll call him Joe). He was one year older, handsome, dangerous, rebellious, and he had his sights set on me. I was in love. It was an escape from the abuse at home. Fast forward about two years. He began pushing, hair pulling, controlling. It began to escalate. More and more and more. Fast forward six more years. We are married. Make up is not allowed. Sex is not allowed to be turned down. Beatings are daily. No money is ever handled nor ever even seen by me. I take a job my cousin offers me at a night club serving shots on the nights joe works third shift. I decide it's time to leave joe, and I needed to start saving money. I had no other place to go and no car to go anywhere. After just a few weeks I have enough to leave. I come home from my shift, and joe had already gotten home early. I walk in the door, and from behind I am out into a choke hold. I black out. For three days I was beaten. Drugged. Raped. A 308 rifle held at my head. The butt of the gun slamming my head into the hard wood floor. Blacking out again. After the three days, my cousin shows up worried, having not heard from me. Joe refuses to answer the door. Cousin calls police. Joe is arrested for attempted murder. He spends three days in prison. His family pleads for me to talk to prosecutor, all while I'm still in the hospital. I'm still in love somehow, and sign something saying I lied. That it wasn't as bad as it seems. That I want to stay with him. That it was my fault basically. He is out on one year probation, and anger management classes. I had already tried staying at a women's shelter, but the only one available was two miles from his work. I could never leave without fear of seeing him. I am thrown out of the shelter for wanting to talk to him. I don't understand why this pit in my stomach, this ache in my heart, the pounding migraines would only stop when I was taing to him. His parents have us move in with them to keep me safe. The Honeymoon phase kicks in for about four months, and then..the hitting starts again. His drugs start again. The beatings get worse while his parents are at work. He refuses to work, I have no way of leaving to work, now under constant supervision. I am walking on eggshells. I have no friends. I used to be so strong. Be so independant. Have goals and a brain. I used to be normal. Now, every slight insult makes me cry for days from outsiders. His praise is all I look for. I feel..brainless. And the saddest part I think, is, I used to be a feminist. I used to do fundraisers for abuse victims and considure myself a survivor. I am stuck. And everyday is a nightmare. I know the facts. I know he will end up killing me. I know I made my bed. I know how I screwed it all up. But how...do I stop it. I want it. I want normal. Right now he can't hit me because he can't get arrested because he is still on probation. It was extended because he never took his anger management classes or ever saw his probation officer. I want him back in prison for longer then two days, but I can't breathe without him. WHY??! Wy must I be that pathetic girl? What is even the point of living, if I'm just here for him to kill me? If I could leave safely I would. But I know I can't. Do any of you know what/where/how I can end this all? Im sorry..I truly am so sorry for becoming such a pathetic persen.its so stupid. I'm so fucking sick of my life.   I was so scared to post this. I was so afraid of negative feedback. I tried posting once and was just called stupid. My body shakes with fear, and I cannot seem to muster up the courage to even start talking about it. I am in my twenties, and all I can dream of is my future. A future with a man (or woman) that I will never have such a tight bond with. But this bond is so tight I am being strangled, and I would rather die alone of natural causes, then to have what little life left in me squeezed out until death.\n\nYour support and words have been so comforting. I cannot express how the love I feel here is more than I have felt in 'real' life in so long. I want more. I crave more. I just wish I knew where to start. I will call the national numbers, as I have before. Maybe, just maybe I will follow through. \n\nI wish there was a step by step guide. I've become quite good at following directions. I love you all. Oh god, I'm so sorry. You're NOT stupid! What you're going through is something that millions of people have gone through. EVERYTHING you have done is completely and utterly normal. The awesome thing is that it IS possible for you to get out. Please seek out a domestic violence shelter-- they know what this is like and they should have the resources to help you get out. \n\nAnd if someone tries to tell you that you're stupid for XYZ or you start to feel like you can't live without him, remember: You are strong. You wouldn't have survived this long if you weren't. You deserve to be happy-- there's someone out there who you will love and who WON'T want to hurt you. You have the capability to leave this guy. And you DON'T need him. You don't need someone that's going to beat you down and who doesn't respect you. The only reason you want him so desperately is because he's made you think that he's the only one that can truly give you approval and that's NOT true. Others out there will think you're awesome, but more than that, you can approve of yourself.\n\nI'm so sorry you have such assholes in your life. &lt;3 If you're in MI I'll buy you a beer and give you a hug. Thank you very much. I went to Detroit to run from him three years ago and didn't make it in the city very long. He came and got me, I don't even know how he found me. But thank you. So. Much. Did you use your credit card? He might have been able to see where you spent your money if he has access to your credit activity. You need to get out, this is absolutely true. You're brave, you'll do it and you'll try to be smart about covering your tracks because you're smart person - You're already on your way to finding yourself again!     Please update us soon, I am very worried about your well-being! I need to know that you're alive, at the very least, and trying to seek help I'm sorry! I'm okay tonight. I do have to delete my Internet history often, delete cookies, everything. He hates reddit and thinks I'm ignoring him while on it. Or that I'm going to meet someone. Lol. I do love my neckbeards ;) after reading so many of your beautiful posts, I know I can survive. I will find a way. It's 4 am here and I have my run bag started, hidden in the pews.

You need to round up as much money as you can, begging from friends, neighbors, churches, anybody.  Save up enough to jump on the Greyhound, with a ticket to as far away from him as you can get in your country.  You don't say where you're living right now, but if you can get to the PNW, I can put you up for a bit.  I'm female, in a fairly stable household, and nobody is allowed to hurt anybody in my house.  I don't have any money to help you get here, but if you can get your greyhound or Amtrak ticket, I'll help you once you get here.  PM for more info.\n thank you so much. Really, you are an incredible person.  I so, so hope you can get out.\n\nIn terms of how he keeps you feeling dependent on him - I am hoping that reading this might help. It seems to be an aha moment trigger for a lot of survivors. http://issendai.livejournal.com/572510.html?page=4 \n\nAlso, and I'm sure you know this, don't forget to delete your internet history.\n\n      ",

    "snippet" : "  Maybe there should be less focus on what women and girls are wearing all the time. Breaking the dress code in high school and middle school wasn't about hating my body or thinking that my appearance the most important thing. It was about being comfortable, or liking certain clothes, or not having the money to buy new ones. I still remember how pissed I was to be pulled out of the classroom with no air-conditioning to get a lecture and a detention during a 90+ degree heat wave because of my shorts and tank top. Constant policing of women's looks extends to clothing choices as well, and I think it does more harm than good.  I have mixed feelings about this article. It seems to me that this middle-school teacher is enforcing the school's dress code for good reasons and genuinely cares about her students and wants to teach them love and respect for themselves. However, I'm not sure that the best way to do that is to force them to cover their bodies. She seems to harbour the belief that displaying your body is the opposite of having love and respect for yourself as a person, which is an unfair assumption that society makes about women. I happen to think I have a rockin' ass *and* make a great conversationalist and am interesting as a person. Sometimes I like to don a pair of yoga pants that show off my rockin' ass *while* having great conversations. It's like I come from crazy upside-down-world. My body is one of the things I like about myself, which does not contradict or diminish my appreciation of my other practical or personal positive qualities.\n\nI'm not sure forcing girls to cover their bodies is a great way to teach them to love themselves. Involving girls in class discussions, acknowledging and rewarding them for their skills and talents, and encouraging them to take part in after school activities would be better, more direct ways to teach young ladies self-love. Doesn't calling attention to girls who show X inches of skin and forcing them to cover up just teach them to be ashamed of their bodies? Isn't that the opposite of self-love? ",

    "snippet" : "What do you think society's general perception of visibly tattooed women is?\n\nI'm curious because I am moderately tattooed in visible places (and planning for more), and I feel like I am largely oblivious to how people perceive me when they see them (I live in the Northeast and have never once experienced a negative reaction--to my face, at least--except for the usual commentary from my family).\n\nI am also sort of fascinated with the increasing rate of women (over men now!) who get tattooed and what that means culturally for us.  \n\nAny thoughts re: women/tattoos are welcome.    If they're well-done tattoos, I think, \"awesome!\" \n\nIf they're crappy tattoos, I think, \"those are some crappy tattoos.\" \n\nIf they're facial tattoos, I think, \"that person must be independently wealthy\"\n\nIf they're racist tattoos, I keep my distance.\n\nIf they're internment camp tattoos, I think, \"what an amazing survivor\"   Don't care not my body. \n\nI'll only notice if it's a really cool piece of art and I'll comment if the person seems like they would be receptive to that. But no touching cause touching strangers is weird.  Thank you for the no-touching.  As with so many things that should be private, too many strangers think that me getting a tattoo = their having the right to touch it / ask me to tell them the entire personal story behind it, etc. I don't understand the desire to touch tattoos. I thought the appeal was entirely visual. Don't they just feel like normal skin? Has anyone ever explained their desire to touch them to you?  I've only ever asked to touch/see so I could hold their arm/hand/leg still so I could take a closer look. I want to be able to appreciate the details! Someone worked hard on that art.

I don't mean to be facetious, but they're a really obvious thing you've done that will by default draw people's attention but then you don't want people to ask about it? Then I don't understand why you would get them? Or why not get them in places people can't see them? Otherwise it seems we're to get something in a highly visible place that is out of the ordinary (so people will obviously ask about it) and then get all shirty about it being rude of them to ask?  This is a great question.  Before I reply, I wanted to know if you have tattoos too?  That will hrlpe figure out the way I want to explain this.\n\nAs a quick side note, I hardly get \"shitty\" about it when people ask.  They probably don't even know how it's affecting me.  But I would like to get back to you with a more complete answer. Oh oops, sorry I didn't mean offence. I live in Australia and we use the term shitty as a slang term for annoyed. Sorry about that. \n\nNo I don't have any tattoos but I thought about it a lot when I was you get and my brothers both do.

I did say any thoughts were welcome, and I am happy to hear yours and see them contribute to the conversation as well!  :-)\n\nI really find your comment so interesting, because I can see how you're trying to balance your honest feelings about tattoos with an attempt to remain objective to some extent--which is totally human.  I also agree with you that we all judge people based on appearances, even if we don't mean or want to and try to train it out of ourselves.  I think that is inevitable.  \n\nI also find anecdotal experiences/evidence so interesting, because yours, for example, is near opposite of mine!  I know tons of 30+ people who continue to get tattoos and show them off when appropriate/asked (myself and my soon-to-be-forty close friend included).  I don't know a lot of people who get \"interests\" tattooed on them, but rather symbols of personal growth or transitions in their lives, etc.  And the vast majority of people I know with tattoos are white-collar workers in prestigious careers and/or high-ranking positions (again, myself included).\n\nIs it possible you've met people professionally who were tattooed, but simply covered up and didn't tell you?  If you met me on a work day, you'd have no idea I was tattooed either, let alone five times including a half-sleeve. :-) Same goes for many of my tatted coworkers.  \n\nI hope that doesn't come off as argumentative.  I am really appreciative of your candor and interested in your thoughts.  \n\nI also have a close friend who used the word \"shocking\" to describe how she feels about people who tattoo themselves, and we've had lots of cool discussions about it.  \n\nAnyway, thanks for commenting!\n I was really expecting massive downvotes, so thanks to everyone for being willing to discuss.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is an oxymoron, but I'm sure all our experiences are shaped by where we live and what we do. I used to work in finance, which is not very tattoo friendly, and here in silicon valley, nerd chic (mostly) does not involve tattoos. I did have a hair stylist who had a really interesting full sleeve though (again, not something I would want to put on my body permanently, but interesting).\n\nI am very sure I have met high earning professionals who were tattooed, but not \"heavily,\" by which I mean that it was something I could see under normal clothes. My mother, who is extremely white collar and well paid, has a small tattoo which is hidden under clothes (she looked into having it removed, but decided it wasn't worth it since no one ever sees it). \n\nHonestly, I might have a more positive opinion of tattoos if I regularly saw doctors, lawyers, engineers with them. Maybe you and your tatted coworkers should rise up and display them in an effort to influence mainstream public opinion ;) This is a tattoo love in, so I am going to tactfully attempt to voice an opposing viewpoint.\n\nIt's your body and if you (male or female) want to tattoo it, that's fine, but I am going to make judgements about you based on it (just as we all do, consciously or not, based on what others wear, drive, read, eat, etc).

No one I have met professionally has been heavily tattooed, ever. \n\nAgain, it's your life and your body, so do as you please, but OP said any thoughts are welcome, so here you go.  I have a half sleeve on each arm, a back piece, a forearm tattoo, a wrist tattoo and a ankle tattoo. I also have a double nostril piercing, 1/2\" lobes, and conch piercings. Thats 4 tattoos that are visible/moderately visible at most times and piercings. I am a med student, I have a placement at a hospital, and I work part time at a shoe store. I have never had a problem getting a job or a placement. I have never been asked to cover up my tattoos or take out my piercings (since they are all studs and close to the body). I have been stopped on the streets and been told to conform to society. I have people assume I am a drop out who lives off welfare, I have had it all. In reality I am squeaky clean from drugs and drinking (not my thing) and I work very hard. I think the perspective is still negative towards woman with tattoos. It was a very male dominated profession/interest until really not that long ago. A lot of ladies would get small tats, but now you see them completely covered. Society is still changing. Most people seem to get at least one tattoo by the time they are 25. It will one day become a social norm, as long as they are non-offensive.  Thank you for sharing your experiences! I (like many others I imagine) was under the impression that having body modifications would make it difficult to find employment, but considering working in a hospital is a pretty conservative environment (you're expecting to work with the children and elderly, etc.) and you haven't faced discrimination there, I'm really pleasantly surprised to learn that there's such strong evidence to the contrary. I have a half sleeve on each arm, a back piece, a forearm tattoo, a wrist tattoo and a ankle tattoo. I also have a double nostril piercing, 1/2\" lobes, and conch piercings.

Most people seem to get at least one tattoo by the time they are 25. It will one day become a social norm, as long as they are non-offensive.  I am in a similar position re: tattoo placement and career.  I have a highly-respected position in a typically conservative/in-the-public-eye type job.  However, the tats have, as you said, never prevented me from getting a job or promotion, and I've never been asked to cover them.  \n\nI think it is awful that random people on the street have acted so inappropriately towards you.  I am sorry you've experienced that.  \n\nI enjoy having a half-sleeve and wrist/forearm tattoos because I *want* to be able to see them!  \n\nHow long do you think it will take until something like 50% of the population has at least one tattoo?  (I think it's something like 20% now.) I think it will raise within the next 10 years. When I was a young, I remember people getting tattoos when they were older. Even my sister got her tattoos when she was 21. The tattoo age is 18 where I am, however, you can be 14 with parent consent. I have met 14 year olds with tattoos (not wise in my opinion but i've come across them!). My boyfriend was 16 when he first got his, and his younger brother was 15. Kids seem to be getting them younger and younger, parents seem to be okay with it, and more people seem to be interested in the industry (at least in my area) so there is a lot of basement tattoos being done. Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo? I am not. I put a lot of thought in my tattoos, and each one has a story or meaning, that way when the art work becomes faded and old, or if I grow tired of it,  I know there is something more to it. I do know a lot of people who regret their tattoos. Most of these people had them done to young and changed a lot since getting them (which is part of the reason I think these teens getting them so young is silly), I know a few who went through a fashion stage, and got inked durning it, so now they have these random tattoos that related to them in no way. One of the girls I know who regrets hers, actually fought with  5 artists until she found one that would do her tattoo exactly how she drew it, upon seeing the work, she realized she was not a great drawer and it's a horrid tattoo. Most of the people I know who regret there tattoos, got them on specific interests at that point in there life, and it is now no longer something they like or care about. My sister for example, she got a scorpion on her leg as she used to be really into astrology. Now, she still likes the art work and placement of the tattoo, but it bothers her because she believes astrology is bullshit now. Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo? Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo? I'm heavily tattooed (sleeve, chest piece, a few smaller ones here and there) and the only one I regret - and had covered a few years ago - was the poorly done first tattoo I got. It was too small for the design and just generally poorly executed, so I had it covered with a larger and better tattoo.\n\nI also sometimes think that, if it weren't for the horrible pain, I would consider covering my chestpiece with a different design. I like it fine, but I have a bit of regret about not saving such prime real estate for something truly epic. We'll see.\n\nAs you can probably tell, though, I don't regret the decision to get heavily tattooed - it's more just that some of my design decisions weren't ideal.  Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo? I do not know many people who regret their tattoos.  I am sure I've come across people who do; I just can't think of anyone I know personally who does.\n\nI have five tattoos altogether.  I regret the first one, which was the only one so far that I didn't plan out meticulously and/or have some intense connection to a major life event.  The placement also bugs me; I seriously had *no* idea what a \"tramp stamp\" was at 22/23 years old.  I really just thought it was a good, open patch of skin.  \n\nThat said, it's a part of my history, so though I would erase if I could (no interest in laser removal), I also hardly ever even see it, let alone think about it, and it does not actively bother me that it is there.  If anything, I will probably try to expand a fuller back piece around it later in life to make it less tramp-stamp-like and more artwork-like.\n\nI also just got a half-sleeve that I wish I'd thought to do art nouveau style instead of realistically.  I like the sleeve though and it is the most meaningful of my tattoos.  Particularly the process of having that one done, plus the artist I used and our conversations, were very meaningful to me as well.  \n\nI feel like, worst case scenario, I have a highly symbolic and valuable account of the best and most transitional moments of my life on me.  If I am slightly less happy with some design element, that is a miniscule issue and can even be fixed or improved.  I am proud of them because I am proud of what I've accomplished in my life, and I feel I've earned those permanent markings so that I can remind myself and others that I am resilient and have battled and defeated some demons along the way here.\n\n I have a \"tramp stamp\" as well, and like you, I had no idea of the stigma attached to tattoos there until I got one. I don't exactly regret the placement though - it's a flat part of the body that is easily covered most of the time and is less likely to change shape as I get older or pregnant. It's annoying to have that stigma, but oh well. It's not a typical \"tramp stamp\" style so I've never gotten any crap about it.  Thanks for saying so.  Always makes me feel better when other women talk about their \"tramp stamps\" and mention that they don't really care, you know? Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo? Question for you (and the OP, and anyone else who wants to answer really):\n\nDo you know anyone personally who is, or perhaps are you yourself, regretful of getting a certain tattoo?  I would suggest that (western) society's general perspective on visibly tattooed women is fairly poor at the moment, but that it is something that is changing. Whether this is brought about by younger generations caring less for old conventions (the general trend towards, 'Who cares?! They should be able to do what they want!' regarding gay marriage) or something else I couldn't necessarily say.\n\nIn a broader sense, I think it is fascinating - is the increase in women getting tattooed a partial by-product of wider discussion about ownership of their bodies? Is it because some ladies just want a tattoo? Are more women interested in them because it of the trend, or is the trend being generated because of the interest? The whole thing is really interesting. &gt;In a broader sense, I think it is fascinating - is the increase in women getting tattooed a partial by-product of wider discussion about ownership of their bodies?

The whole thing is really interesting.\n\nThis is TOTALLY why I posted the thread.  I am absolutely, as you said, fascinated by it.  For me, I know I progressed from buying into the socially-taught stereotype that tattoos were a sign of lower class, unintelligent, lazy people (when I was a kid) to growing up and coming to see it as a form of fine art, personal expression, body-ownership (love that you touched on that)--even and especially a way of literally marking my own journey through life.\n\nI have tried to research this, but Google only gives me so much non-crap stuff, and I am not sure how to get deeper into the topic. It's .. well.. I'm not sure interesting is the right word - but I remember having a discussion with another guy about it going back about 7 or 8 (might been more than that, damn ye foggy brain) years ago, and him talking about tattoed women through the narrow world view of his perspective on them. That one tattoo was cute, but that 3 were too many, but once you got to around 6 or so it swung back around to cute again.\n\nI later theorized that this had something to do with the perception of it - that once it reached a certain point it became an identifying feature, as in 'the tattooed girl' rather than 'the tall girl that has a tattoo'. It seemed to me, when talking to other people, that they'd be more focused on WHAT it was of, WHERE it was, and would use that information to try to explain their perspective of this person - that a woman of x age who had a tattoo in y place meant z.\n\nI do think (and I can't back this up at all with any kind of scientific fact) that as the years have passed people seem to care less about it, though certain stereotyping is still prevalent (ie the so called tramp stamp). Your equation example (woman of x age gets y tattoo in z location and it equals...?) is spot-on, I think.  Shit, I even do that and didn't realize it until.you said this in your comment. I've also heard it suggested that the more tattoos or body modifications a lady gets, the more likely it is that she's masochistic. Now compare that to a guy that gets lots of tattoos.. the assumption isn't that he's masochistic, but that he's tough or a badass. I would suggest that these sorts of assumptions are based partially on perception through the gender prism though again I have no real proof to back up that claim.\n\nI do wonder if these perceptions are things that will simply change over time, as more people in general get tattoos.  You know, there is evidence (though I'm too lazy to link it, sorry!) that people who get tattoos have a higher pain tolerance/threshold and therefore potentially a (very slightly) higher risk of behaviors like self-injury and/or suicide.  Or I guess I should say, when reading books on the psychology of suicide (something else I'm interested in), they almost all list an ability to tolerate pain as a necessary characteristic in those who eventually attempt suicide, and then link tattoos, piercings, etc. to that.\n\nThe masochism thing is nuts though!  I HATE the feeling of getting tattoos, but suffer through it for the end result!  I'm also not fond of blow-drying my hair or wearing bras or pantyhose, but I do those things too--and no one thinks I'm masochistic for it even if my stomach hurts after an eight-hour workday in three-inch heels.  \n\nIt's funny what people pick and choose to interpret the way they do, isn't it!  \n\nAnyway, I agree with your gender prism assumption. I've also heard it suggested that the more tattoos or body modifications a lady gets, the more likely it is that she's masochistic. Now compare that to a guy that gets lots of tattoos.. the assumption isn't that he's masochistic, but that he's tough or a badass.

Worst masochist ever. &gt;In a broader sense, I think it is fascinating - is the increase in women getting tattooed a partial by-product of wider discussion about ownership of their bodies?

As a very visibly tattooed woman, I can't say having tattoos has ever held me back from anything, and I've never heard any negativity about them to my face.  The only weirdness about them is that men seem to fetishize them.  I've been asked multiple times if I'm a Suicide Girl (thanks), and men have often used my tattoos as an excuse to try to pick up on me, which is fairly annoying since the last thing I generally feel like talking about are my tattoos!   I'm 21 and I don't have any tattoos, nor want any at the moment, although I haven't ruled it out. I have a distinct positive bias towards women with tattoos. I assume they're really cool and interesting chicks with strong opinions and have claimed ownership of their bodies. Ditto for piercings, body modifications and certain \"alernative\" looks on women. It's worth it to note that none of these have made it into my personal style (yet).\n\nIt may be a little silly, but there it is.  I don't really think anything of it. It's like asking what comes to mind when I see a woman with glasses on. \n\nTimes are a-changin'. Based on  your comments to other people, you are a  woman with confidence, intelligence, and have proven that you work hard and have earned your success. So, really, what other people think of your tattoos clearly doesn't matter :)\n\nPS: I always wanted tattoos but I have a very low pain tolerance and am afraid of chickening out mid-session and ending up with something like a random line instead of a whole tattoo. I'm envious of your tattoos! Don't let your low pain tolerance hold you back. I have a very low pain tolerance... my tattoo hurt less than my nose ring or getting my ears pierced or bumping my head on my kitchen cabinet. I got it in a spot that's mixed between sensitive and painless areas. Most of the tattoo it felt like this buzzing scratch feeling, except when it got up near my arm pit, then I was like YEP THAT'S A NEEDLE PUNCTURING MY SKIN.  WORST ever places were my under-arm right under the armpit and my spine.  UGH. Dang, I was sort of thinking of a spine tattoo at some point (I want a water iris) but now I might reconsider the placement again if it will be burning suck the whole time.

I'm envious of your tattoos! Thanks for the support!  I honestly do not care if others have a negative opinion of my tattoos--that's not really why I posted.  I am actually just fascinated by the whole topic, and particularly as it applies to gender roles/norms/stereotypes.\n\nI agree with the other commenter too--don't be afraid of the pain!  I think it's actually easier to get through than you'd realize because of how your endorphins help you out!     Whenever I see a person with a tattoo from a distance, i think 'ew skin infection'. Because, from a distance, thats exactly what it resembles, a big discolored blob on your skin. Seeing the person closer, i never think \"oh! a tattoo!\", its always \"ugh, a tattoo\". \n\nI mean its totally fine if that's your thing but I personally find them repulsive. Tattoos to me are as appealing as the graffiti I see strewn across bridges and boxcars. I feel sorry for the person who has them because they have self selected themselves out of a high ranking position in career tracts as well as upward social mobility, even though all tatted up people will mercilessly defend otherwise, backing it up with no statistics or data to support their claims. \n\nIt is, however, your decision to have them and I support a person's free will to do whatever they want to their bodies. I hope this comment doesn't get downvoted because OP asked for my opinion, and this is how I truly feel.  I am totally happy to hear ANY opinions, as I stated in the post!  :-)\n\nI actually really appreciate your graffiti analogy.  You had me looking at my forearm tats in the store today, wondering if others saw them that way (in an intrigued sort of way!).  I actually kind of like that analogy a lot, and it definitely helped me understand exactly how you react to them.  So... cool and thanks for sharing that!\n\nI guess I don't agree (as you said) that we've selected ourselves out of high-ranking positions in career tracts... partially because I have a high-ranking position in my career.  And I'm a well-respected and well-known member of my community because of the career and volunteer work I do.  \n\nDo you have statistics or data to back up *your* claims about that?  I am not asking in an antagonistic way; I am genuinely curious to see it/look into it, as I have NO idea what that data would look like!\n\nThanks again for your input.   Don't really care how much ink a woman has on her, but I'd be lying if I said that I have never stared at a particularly beautiful piece.    I've been born and raised in the south (Texas and South Carolina) and honestly I'm jealous when I see a girl with visible tattoos. They seem to always pull it off with ease. I'd like to get some tattoos, but I don't think I'll ever been 100% happy with an image or where to put it, so for now I'm just chickening out and being jealous. Maybe it's because for the passed few years I've been living in Austin and there are sooooo many people with tattoos here.  Your first sentence--were you going to make a correlation between the South and their views of tattoos?   I mean, OP said where they were from and how they never got any flack about tattoos, and the South is generally more conservative. Gotcha.  I'm OP btw.  :-) I've been born and raised in the south (Texas and South Carolina) and honestly I'm jealous when I see a girl with visible tattoos. They seem to always pull it off with ease. I'd like to get some tattoos, but I don't think I'll ever been 100% happy with an image or where to put it, so for now I'm just chickening out and being jealous. Maybe it's because for the passed few years I've been living in Austin and there are sooooo many people with tattoos here.  You can always join in the fun with henna or body paint :)\n\nI admire great tattoo art pieces, but I would get tired of having just one design. I like being able to change things, so I mainly express myself through my alternative clothing.    I don't know about society, but I usually assume that they are super confident and know exactly who they are.  I get a little jealous because tattoos, to me at least, seem to carry a lot of convictions and feelings. To show those deep parts of yourself in the open, even if you don't really explain it to everyone, strikes me as confident and free. I have one tattoo, but it is not visible.  I love that tattoo, it reminds me of my really good friends, but I never really thought about putting it somewhere other people could see because it was so personal to me.\n\nAlso, I get partly jealous because I usually assume their work allows them to show tattoos, even though that might not be true.  I used to work in a company that made people with sleeve tattoos wear long sleeved shirts all the time.  I don't think that's fair and I don't like that it implies they can't be who they are just because of their line of work. I love your comment.  \n\nI do think everyone has the right to see their tattoos as they see fit: either they are so personal to you that you rather they aren't visible, or they're something you do want to share, so they are.  Or anything in between.  Your body, your symbolism... you decide!  \n\nI can show my tats at work in certain situations (most of the time), and there is no rule against showing them in general, but I do hide them when dealing with the public/at special events so that I don't have to deal with someone having a bad opinion of me/my job because of my ink instead of my job performance.  I just think that's smart.  Pretty! I've never come across a half-sleeve on a woman in real life that I haven't really liked and admired as a piece of art. They usually elicit a \"nice ink\" comment from me :)\n\nPrison tatts though (and those in that style) don't evoke the same response. I just start thinking about how un-aesthetic they are and how glad I am not to have any. I don't like the way they go green.\n\nFacial tattoos ([\"moko\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C4%81_moko)) are a part of Māori culture that are fairly rare to see where I live. I've only seen them a couple of times. I try to stay respectful but can feel a bit cowed. They're serious business. I've never seen a facial tattoo in person, but I think that'd be super interesting!                Hot.",

    "snippet" : "I started thinking after I read [this article](http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55833695-78/beauty-notes-issue-kite.html.csp) about two women in my state.\n\nI get that this is Utah, and I get that the general culture here is to censor anything even remotely suggestive.  But I think this goes deeper than Mormon culture, because I see this a lot everywhere.  They're protesting and covering up Sports Illustrated swimsuit models highlighting major female athletes.  \n\nNow, if they were protesting the glorification of anorexic and unhealthy models, or protesting ridiculous amounts of photoshop that morph models into utterly impossible shapes, I'd be all for it.  But they're protesting the fact that they even posed at all, and started censoring every SI issue they could find with sticky notes that said, \"There is more to me than eye candy\" and \"You are capable of much more than looking hot.\"  That last one in particular bothers me.  Of course they're capable of more than looking hot:  *they're athletes!*  I'm pretty sure they already know that!  Not to mention, while the SI photos focus on their physical attributes, they're accompanied by long articles highlighting their athletic and personal achievements.   \n\nIt just seems like they're assuming that since these women are posing for magazines in revealing clothing, they have no self esteem and are objectifying themselves, or are too stupid to realize they have worth beyond their appearance.  Look, they worked damn hard to get to where they are, and if they're proud of their bodies and wish to show them off, **let them!!!** As long as they're healthy, they can do as they like!  \n\nAnother trend I've noticed is a violent backlash against shaming curvy women that just shoots into the other extreme.  \"Real women have curves, real women don't look like Barbie, real women don't have gigantic disproportionate breasts, real women have meat on their bones! Those *unreal* women cause eating disorders and low self esteem!\"  Well Jesus, I'm sorry.  I'm six feet tall, thin, I have 36DDD breasts, and I exercise every day to stay healthy.  I'm sorry my mere existence is offensive and gives girls eating disorders!  I guess if I want to become a model or an actress I have to slouch low, gain weight, adopt a sedentary lifestyle, and get a breast reduction just so I can be a \"real\" woman and not hurt any feelings! I can't just be proud of who I am!\n\nModels should be **healthy.** Anything other than health is irrelevant.  If a woman naturally has a BMI of 18 (technically underweight) but is perfectly healthy, let her model, don't shame her and call her anorexic!  If a woman has a natural BMI of 26 (technically overweight) but eats right and is physically fit, let her model, don't shame her and call her fat!  And even if a woman **is** unhealthy, whether she's starving herself or weighs 500 pounds, she doesn't deserve scorn, she needs help!\n\nArgh, sorry about the rant.    Mormons don't care that they're skinny, they care that they're not clothed. I dont think it's about body image much as it is about forcing modesty on others. Bodies are nothing to be ashamed of but Utah has some pretty big weirdos. \n\nYeah everyone has a different body. I don't mean to be rude but this has kind of been discussed to death, especially here. Body shaming someone is wrong whether they're skinny or fat or light or dark or small or big or out of proportion or even or odd or whatever.\n\nBut yeah, Mormons are really not into showin skinnnn I seriously cannot wait to move out of this state....  Fucking Utah, man.   I Moved to Utah recently and what confuses me is that there is this attitude like in the article but then you can't go a mile on the freeway without a billboard for breast implants (and other cosmetic procedures) or porn addiction. I think ~~mormons~~ people here would be happier if they just admit that boobs are nice and sex is fun.  fat girl here, I am utterly grossed out by the rush to defend \"curves\" by shaming thin women as \"anorexic\" \"skin and bones\" etc.  Can't we all be fucking gorgeous?  Can't a pretty woman also be smart?  We're all \"real women\" ffs.  First, let me say I agree with pretty much all of what you have to say. I agree that what we should be throwing shade at unrealistic photoshop/makeup/extreme dieting as standards of beauty, and I think that it's absurd to say that showing skin equates to having no self-respect. \n\nAnyway, I've heard that \"body acceptance = fat supremacy\" complaint, and I have on very few occasions actually seen it happen. Every day, from every source of media, thin people get reinforcement that their body type is acceptable and desirable, whereas heavier (not even fat or overweight) people get implicit scorn and the message that they are not attractive. And unfortunately, in American culture (and sadly most cultures in the world), attractiveness is made out to be a prerequisite to being considered valuable in any way. \n\nThe reason body acceptance mostly focuses on larger bodies is because people who aren't thin can't get reinforcement by looking at a magazine, or on TV, or on the front page of Reddit. Just because body acceptance doesn't show primarily your body type doesn't mean it's against it. I doubt that any person worth listening to would tell you that because you work out and eat well means you're causing eating disorders (maybe on some extreme social justice tumblr, I don't know) but it sounds like most body acceptance people would agree with you wholeheartedly. The people who would shame you for your body are not representative of most.   As a skinny woman, I have never been insulted or denigrated because of my size. Mostly jealous remarks, really. \n\nI wouldn't feel bad about my body if I were called anorexic. I'd just feel bad for having to live in a society where it's acceptable to ACCUSE someone, maliciously, of having a very real and very serious disorder.

Yeah, it's messed up when people go on the other extreme, but I still encounter much more fat-shaming than thin-shaming (like, so much more, it's absurd) that while it bothers me, it doesn't feel like as big of a deal, since I don't feel like it's an institutionalized form of oppression.

As someone who was underweight as a child and who has dealt with anorexia over the past few years, it's extremely hurtful to hear strangers and people you know thinking it's okay to make disgusting and ridiculous comments like \"god, gain some weight, I don't even want to hug you because you might break in my arms,\" or \"guys like a girl with meat on her bones, you just look disgusting,\" and crap like that. Shaming anyone because of their body is terrible, regardless of who deals with it more often. It's hurtful to fat shame and thin shame. I agree that it is hurtful to fat shame and to thin shame, and I just want you to know that I'm not trying to dismiss the experiences you've had with people being assholes, I don't think your experiences are any less real or hurtful than anyone else's. However, what I'm trying to say that on a *societal level*, there is not the same kind of discrimination against thin people as there is for fat people. In general, thin is seen as a positive quality, being thin doesn't preclude you from shopping at many clothing stores unless they are specific niche shops for heavier women, it doesn't stop you from getting most jobs. The societal benefits that come with being thin almost always outweigh the benefits of being fat, by a long shot.

I don't really like that.  Just because something happens less often doesn't mean it's not important or a big deal.  If a skinny girl kills herself because people kept telling her to eat a sandwich and accusing her of being anorexic, is that somehow less important than an overweight girl killing herself for being called fat?    I don't really like that.  Just because something happens less often doesn't mean it's not important or a big deal.  If a skinny girl kills herself because people kept telling her to eat a sandwich and accusing her of being anorexic, is that somehow less important than an overweight girl killing herself for being called fat?    No, but that's not what I said, either. I do not think a suicide based on a stigma of being fat or being thin is better or worse, either one is horrible. I was talking about body oppression as an institution in our society. My argument could be compared to treating people different based on socioeconomic status. Is thinking someone is \"bad\" because they're poor *intrinsically* worse than thinking someone is bad because they are rich? No, but in our society discrimination against the poor has a far more severe impact on the general population than discrimination against the rich.\n\nI do think thin privilege is a real thing, and I don't think it's fair to say that discrimination against thin people in our society (for being thin, I mean) is comparable to the discrimination in our society against fat people for being fat. I hope that explains where I'm coming from. I get what you're saying, and looking at discrimination as a whole I agree with you.  A fat woman is more likely to have body issues than a thin woman.  However, my rant is based more on the *individual* level.  Obviously I don't feel the need to start a skinny-pride parade, since that's unnecessary, but just because fat shaming happens more often doesn't mean it's any less hurtful to me when I'm subject to skinny-shaming.  \n\nBut my rant also involves the hypocrisy of claiming one one hand that women are independent and capable of making their own decisions, while on the other hand blasting magazine models for \"objectifying themselves\" or \"contributing to negative body images.\"  Like I said, if she's healthy, she has every right to show off her body if she so chooses and it's not her responsibility to censor herself just to protect delicate feelings.   I don't really like that.  Just because something happens less often doesn't mean it's not important or a big deal.  If a skinny girl kills herself because people kept telling her to eat a sandwich and accusing her of being anorexic, is that somehow less important than an overweight girl killing herself for being called fat?    I have *never* heard anyone say to a thin girl \"Ugh. You're so skinny that you're disgusting. You should kill yourself so that I don't have to look at you!\" I have, however, heard things of that spirit said to overweight women - or something very similar and equally harsh - more times than I care to count. Body shaming is wrong, period. No one should make you feel bad for the body you have. And on both sides of the aisle, the thin and the heavy, some people may not find you attractive. It doesn't give them the right to make you feel awful about yourself, but on the whole it isn't something that the skinny set has to deal with. Heavy women are less likely to be hired than thin women, have a hard time finding stylish clothes, and are mocked pretty much constantly. I have a hard time feeling very bad for the thinner women of the world who are having to deal with the occasional barb thrown their way every once in a while.

And I think that it's absolutely *ridiculous* to react to a campaign that is intended to try to make overweight women feel better about themselves and included as some sort of implied attack on skinny women. It's not intended as an attack and it just isn't an attack. \n\nStop looking for things to get offended over, especially when it's not meant to cause offense, it's intended to do good for a minority group that has experienced a lot of pain and discrimination, and it doesn't mean what you personally have decided it means. I get VERY tired hearing about how skinny girls (like myself) aren't \"real women\" because they don't have miles of curves.\n\nIMO, that's a load of bullshit. The problem with what you said is that nobody told you any such thing. The message is not intended for anyone but curvy women and it's intended to try and make larger women feel positive about themselves. \n\nI think it's absolute bullshit to take offense when no offense is either intended or present, but imagined. It's doubly bullshit to attack a campaign that's intended for a discriminated part of the population feel included and valued as human beings.

Real women aren't sluts that show cleavage in normal vneck shirts.\"\n\nBut you shouldn't feel offended by that. It's not for you, it's for those poor women that don't have large busts. We're just making them feel better about the fact that their breasts aren't so large they fall out of everything, because that's what we've been told is sexy!\n\n/s The difference is, you're using exclusionary language, narrowing your definition down so much it's  deliberately intended to offend and exclude. Your *intent* is negative. [deleted] &gt;How is that part offensive?\n\nIt's very specifically exclusionary, and hence offensive.\n\nThe comments you mention, to which you're objecting to, are offensive. The message \"real women have curves\" is in itself *not* offensive. \n\nIt's meant to make women who are overweight feel included and valued. It also applies to *all* women, since there's no such thing as a perfectly angular human being. A 200 lb woman is curvy, and so are you - in your own ways. The language isn't exclusionary, and it's intended to make people feel better about themselves.\n\nIf some people *choose* to respond to the message with offensive comments, that's *their* problem. \n\nJust like if some people *choose* to take offense to a non-offensive message, then that's *their* problem, too.\n\n&gt;(Though, I've been a part of 2x for a really long time, and all I can say is repeat what my bf calls it - r/atheism for fat chicks. /shrug)\n\nNow THAT is actually super-offensive! (And you know why.) For a person that has posted objecting to allegedly offensive messages about weight/body image, why is it that you felt compelled to write one yourself? Perhaps? You may insist I \"should\" think of that way, but it's not going to change the fact that I (and many other women) get very offended by that term.\n\n&amp;while I disagree with my bf's language (he actually prefers the word 'bitches'), I think he has a point. With 66% of Americans being overweight,  I would say the chance of an average woman here being overweight is about 2 out of 3, as well. It must be frustrating to be constantly showed pictures of very thin women that represent less than 10% of the population, and being told that **every** woman is \"supposed\" to look like that. \n\nI actually really enjoy r/atheism because I do have that mentality towards religion as many of those members share. However, I also know it's a circlejerk, but it's because I grew up my whole life surrounded by religion and I am /really/ frustrated at Christianity (I'm in the US) and how a small, vocal majority insists that we should all be like that. \n\nSo, I can't blame 2x for reacting the way it does, since I can understand why. \n\n(I don't know why I bother anymore posting in weight topics here. It's like going into r/atheism and trying to change their attitude towards religion.) &gt;Is anyone else angry about how body-acceptance sometimes turns into \"shame skinny girls and judge them for their personal choices\"?\n\nNo. \"Skinny\" girls enjoy a kind of privilege that is denied to larger women. \n\nI'm tall and fit and I don't shame either fat or thin.

Saying \"skinny women look like little boys\" isn't wrong?\n\nI am so sick of this fucking prejudice+power bullshit.  Just because you are part of a \"privileged\" group doesn't mean everyone else gets a free pass to be an asshole.   &gt; I am so sick of this fucking prejudice+power bullshit. Just because you are part of a \"privileged\" group doesn't mean everyone else gets a free pass to be an asshole. \n\nThis is absolutely right, imo, but I think you might be missing the reason why some people aren't smitten with your post, so maybe I can explain why? But please don't take this as a personal attack, I'm just trying to explain.\n\nI think people are mildly upset by this topic because it feels like you are accusing the \"body positive\" community of making skinny women feel bad about their weight, and it's tough because for a lot of people that same community has been a constant source of inspiration for them. Now, I won't deny that there are *some* self-identified members of the BP community that \"skinny-shame\" others, but I think that is really rare. I think the people who make comments like \"girls need some meat on their bones\" and the like, generally aren't the people campaigning seriously for fat acceptance, in fact the only people who I've seen make those kind of arguments are generally men (and occasionally women) who just want to justify their own sexual preferences with no genuine concern for the actual discrimination in society against fat people. Maybe you can't relate to those experiences, but in general I don't think the body positivity movement is pro-skinny-shaming.\n\nAs for the \"prejudice + power\" formula, that shouldn't be used for justifying genuine discrimination against a privileged group, it's just important to realize that there's a difference when a random asshole makes a mean comment about a skinny woman's weight and institutionalized discrimination about fat people/fat women that exists in our culture, (e.g. little to no representation in the media, socially accepted stereotypes like fat people being lazy, discrimination in job market, etc.)\n\nI think that people feel the need to note the difference between these two forms of discrimination because there have been a lot of times that I have witnessed and in general, that people will dismiss the importance of the fat positivity movement saying that, \"Well, if people aren't fair to you, that's just how it is sometimes, it happens to everyone. That's life, get over it.\" Which is problematic for obvious reasons. &gt;I think people are mildly upset by this topic because it feels like you are accusing the \"body positive\" community of making skinny women feel bad about their weight\n\nI tried really hard not to come across like that, and I'm sorry if I did.  It's why I said \"Is anyone else angry about how body-acceptance **sometimes** turns into \"shame skinny girls and judge them for their personal choices\"?\"  I didn't want to paint a large and overwhelmingly positive movement with the same brush.   &gt;I think people are mildly upset by this topic because it feels like you are accusing the \"body positive\" community of making skinny women feel bad about their weight\n\nI tried really hard not to come across like that, and I'm sorry if I did.

Just because you are part of a \"privileged\" group doesn't mean everyone else gets a free pass to be an asshole.   [deleted] I see where you are coming from but I have to politely disagree. It isn't alright to bring someone down, as a way to bring yourself up. All through high school I was (and am) skinny and flatter (34B). Through high school some of my \"friends\" who were curvier or more overweight would constantly vent to me about how \"real men\" don't want twigs like me (and yes I was used as an example) and that they want someone with curves. As a result, through most of high school I was incredibly self-conscious. I understand now that what they said wasn't ok, but also that they did it to make themselves feel better. However, it made me feel awful and made me think I was ugly until I grew up and became more confident. But regardless, I still get comments now and then about how I'm too skinny, etc. whereas I'm at an ideal weight. But they still hurt, and reading things such as was mentioned by op can hurt too. \n\nSO I have to disagree in that if in order to feel better about yourself you have to do things that bring others down as a direct result, then you are going about a not so great method of increasing your feeling of self worth. Can't we all just love ourselves for what we are without bringing other body types down?  &gt;Can't we all just love ourselves for what we are without bringing other body types down?\n\nTotally agree. But telling \"curvy\" women that they're \"real\" women and just as beautiful in their own way is in no way bringing down or attacking other body types. No, but telling curvy women that they're the *only* real women at the exclusion of thin women *is* bringing down and attacking other body types. &gt;No, but telling curvy women that they're the only real women at the exclusion of thin women is bringing down and attacking other body types.\n\nDoes the campaign really say *ONLY* real women have curves? No, it doesn't. You're taking offense where there is nothing to cause offense! Just because the campaign doesn't explicitly say anything about thinner women doesn't mean that people won't take it that way. I can't count the times \"real women have *curves*\" has been said in a snotty, insulting way to me by larger women, and it's damn obvious they're implying I'm not one of these so-called \"real women\". This is less about the campaign and more about the fact that it's dividing women over something trivial instead of teaching us all to love ourselves. The people taking offense are the ones with the problem. \n\n&gt; I can't count the times \"real women have curves\" has been said in a snotty, insulting way to me by larger women\n\nSimply straight-up unbelievable.\n\nThis campaign doesn't divide people and isn't intended to. It's intended to bring women closer together by encouraging body acceptance, regardless of whether someone is fat or thin. &gt;Can't we all just love ourselves for what we are without bringing other body types down?\n\nTotally agree. But telling \"curvy\" women that they're \"real\" women and just as beautiful in their own way is in no way bringing down or attacking other body types. I completely agree that telling curvy women that they are valuable and should feel comfortable and proud of their-selves is a fantastic thing, but when in doing that you are attacking other body types, by excluding people who are skinnier, or flatter, or incredibly blessed with a classic hour glass figure then I do consider it bringing others down. But I do agree in that there is nothing wrong in telling a person who has a less conventional body type that she is just as real a woman as any other body type. We just have to as a community work on being more inclusive to all types of bodies, without bringing someone else down.\n\nedit: I think that we are in agreement but that we only disagree in which examples happen to do a good job of meeting our identical goals. So ignore wall of text, since it's irrelevant. [deleted] If you said \"real women are models,\" then yes, there would be a problem. That's actually a perfect example of how you've chosen to distort and twist around the message that was being said, thank you. \n\nedit: Are... are you reporting my comments merely because you disagree with what I've been saying?   Thanks for writing this! I definitely understand what you're getting at.\nI've been having to deal with the 'skinny shaming' a lot. I'm 6' tall, and have been pretty skinny for the past couple of years because of some ongoing GI problems. \nAs a result, I've had all sorts of people (professors, acquaintances, a couple of times even strangers) come up to me and tell me that I should gain weight, or that I shouldn't try so hard to match popular images, or that I need to 'put some meat' on my bones. And it doesn't help my case that I sometimes refuse food due to the aforementioned GI issues.\nIt's really not a big deal (I always just smile and joke about it), but I don't like that all thin women are lumped in together as having some kind of deep-seated, weight-based emotional trauma.  I think the underlying problem here is, again, not really a fat versus skinny problem. Those same people would feel just as entitled to remark on your body and your eating habits if you were fat. The underlying problem here is that they feel like they have that right because some how your body belongs to them. \n\nWhich is the deep dynamic underlying pretty much all the shaming and mixed messages women get about our bodies. Our bodies aren't ourselves, we aren't people, our bodies are things that belong to the community and we somehow owe it to the world to fix our bodies for them.\n\nAlthough I do make an exception for mothers.  I always feed my daughters when I go visit them. Son in law too. It's a maternal thing. I don't tell them there's anything wrong with them, though.  I just fill up the refrigerator.  Because I'm their mom and that's what I do.  I never know what to think about fat shaming.\n\nWell, that's not right. I know exactly what I think about fat shaming. Or any kind of shaming. There should be no shaming. Shaming is a horrible behaviour. LESS SHAMING MOAR HUGGING\n\nBUT when a lady.... or a dude, for that matter, has a diet and exercise regime that is making them ill, promoting a body positive image to them feels deeply counterproductive. It's not a positive thing to be obese or severely underweight, that shit is related to all sorts of horrible health problems that can have a really negative affect on your life- and on the lives of the people that love you.\n\nWe should, by all means, learn to love the skin we're in- but we also need encouragement and support to make the necessary changes keep ourselves healthy.

I don't understand why \"You shouldn't make fun of people for being 'fat'\" has to turn into \"Thin women are inherently horrible,\" but it seems pretty common in the \"body acceptance\" movement. It's not that hard to just let people live their lives; I don't get why so many people have to make fun of others just to lift themselves up. :/  &gt;I disagree that models should be required to be healthy (just seems unfair)\n\nWhy?  I don't think it's a good idea to glorify a 600 pound model any more than it's okay to glorify an 80 pound anorexic model. I'm not saying a woman with a cold or a broken leg couldn't model.   I just don't value health as much as some people do, I think. I figure if a person wants to model and there is a place that wants to hire that person to model, s/he should be allowed to model. \n\nI know that's probably strange/unpopular, but I've always felt that way. I don't really see why everyone should value health if they don't want to.  &gt;I'm sorry my mere existence is offensive and gives girls eating disorders!\n\nAccording to the things I've read on the subject (as I am a \"skinny girl\" as well), your mere existence isn't offensive... only \"real\" women have curves, which I guess means you and I aren't real women... so neither of us exists at all apparently.\n\nI think this statement is stupid to be quite honest.

I mean... isn't a \"real\" woman anyone with the proper genetic make-up and/or identity as a female?  If she has 36DDD boobs, then she's definitely got some curves.  For which I immediately get accused of having cosmetic surgery because, of course, thin busty women like me don't real.   36DDD is not thin and busty.   It is if you're six feet tall.   It is if you're six feet tall.   not really.  My 34G sized boobs, which would be the same volume as a 36FF would not look large on a 6 foot tall person.   not really.  My 34G sized boobs, which would be the same volume as a 36FF would not look large on a 6 foot tall person.   They really would though.  I constantly have people gawking at my boobs, and have been told by many people that they're quite large.  I mean, they're not [gargantuan,](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mmBw3uzPnJI/S5piLwS-BdI/AAAAAAABFog/hfRxFnzwCQ8/s1600/epic_boobs_girl_05.jpg) but you don't have to have beach balls on your chest to be considered busty.  Hell, Marilyn Monroe was a 36D, and she's the poster-gal of busty women.     \"Real Women Have Curves\" ...Fuck that. I'm 5'4 95lbs. I guess I'm a fake woman. Jeez, you guys, it's not about \"only women with curves are real women\"! It's Not. About. You.\n\nIt's about: you don't have to hate yourself every time you look in the fucking mirror, because you have thighs.  Because it's okay for women to have thighs.  In the world of real women, unlike the world of all the images you see staring at you every day from everywhere, there are a LOT of women with thighs.  Women with thighs, and bellies, and jiggles, and fat, are constantly (at every grocery store cash register, in every TV show, every movie, every TV commercial) bombarded with messages that they are unattractive and they need to hide their horrible shameful bodies. \n\nSo then somebody comes up with the expression \"real women have curves\" to help women with curves know that they too can be beautiful and attractive the way they are.\n\nIts SO not about you.\n\nWhich is not to say that you aren't entitled to be angry if anyone tells you you are less than beautiful for being tiny.  Tiny can also be beautiful.  But less face it, you're not getting bad messages about THAT. It's great that it makes some people feel better about themselves, but if whoever made that up *wasn't* trying to make people without curves (which, by the way, is more than just thin people: most fat people don't have curves either) feel like shit, then they picked a fucking horrible way to do it. Your interpretation couldn't really be considered wrong, but do you seriously think that most people see that? Do you really think that most people without curves interpret that phrase as something that's meant to lift people with curves up without putting anyone else down? Because, to the rest of us, that reads an awful fucking lot like \"You're not a real woman if you don't have 'curves'\". \n\nAlso, they seem to be using the word \"curves\" wrong, or at least the people that spout off that saying all the god damn time. Just because a woman is plus-sized doesn't mean she automatically has curves, and just because a woman wears a size 00 doesn't mean she doesn't have curves. Having a well-defined waist means she probably has curves. And that's more an issue of body type than weight, so the fact that this saying seems to have become all about weight is another annoying as fuck thing about it.  Well, maybe it's time to retire the expression \"real women have curves.\" In my personal universe of spacetime it only came along yesterday and it's still novel.  But I realize that my \"yesterday\" is like, ten or fifteen years. (Or longer? I first remember hearing it with the movie of the same name.) \n\nMaybe we need to come up with some new catchphrases that don't sound so exclusionary.  I mean, I have to agree that the last thing ANY woman needs is a new way of hearing that she's not adequate as a woman.\n\nHow about all women are real women? \n\nAnd maybe we can just tear down all the fucking billboards.   I **hate** the \"Real women have curves!\" rabble rabble rabble...\n\nNo. Real women have a vagina. That's it. Doesn't matter how thin you are, how large your breasts are, whether you're muscular, obese, big boned, super svelte, etc. \n\nYou don't have to put down someone else's body type just to promote your own. Argh. &gt;Real women ~~have a vagina~~ identify as women. That's it.\n\nTrans* exclusion isn't cool. I **hate** the \"Real women have curves!\" rabble rabble rabble...\n\nNo. Real women have a vagina. That's it.

    "snippet" : "I was reading \"A Room with a View\" and this passage stood out to me. The entire book, even though it was written more than a century ago, is more feminist than a lot of books that I see today, in some ways.\n\nJust a little bit of context: Mr. George Emerson is telling Miss Lucy Honeychurch why she shouldn't marry her fiance Cecil Vyse.\n\n\"He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things--books, pictures--but kill when they come to people. That's why I'll speak out through all this muddle even now. It's shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters. Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbor. That is the man all over--playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find. Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for *you* to settle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren't let a woman decide. He's the type who kept Europe back for a thousand years. Every moment of his life he's forming you, telling you what's charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man things womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of your own. So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon. Therefore--not 'therefore I kissed you,' because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control. I'm not ashamed. I don't apologize. But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But therefore--therefore I settled to fight him.\"\n\nLucy thought of a very good remark.\n\n\"You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.\"\n\nAnd he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He said:\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" and sank down as if suddenly weary. \"I'm the same kind of brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman--it lies very deep, and men and women must fight ti together before they shall enter the garden. But I do love you--surely in a better way than he does.\" He thought. \"Yes--really in a better way. I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.\"\n\nTo be honest, I'd choose this guy over Mr. Darcy any day.   Ah, this was referenced in a [Dream Theater song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O4_C68PmFI)... (warning, it's pretty depressing) ",
