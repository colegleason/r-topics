Creedence Clearwater Revival - \"Long as I can see the light\" Anyone know the song at the end?  I feel like this whole season has been spec written by people who only have a vague understanding of the characters. Some of the individual jokes are still funny, but they will sell out these characters for a quick laugh any chance they get.      This episode was horrible. They completely botched the Robin-Barney storyline here. We were supposed to believe that Barney's a changed man, but he still lies? And Robin is somehow okay with it because of one lame speech from Barney that their relationship was built on lies? really? Do you really expect me to believe that any woman would stay with Barney this way? With Barney and Robin's engagement there was a chance at showing an aspect of life after your  golden twenties deeply and meaningfully, like the decision to marry, have a child, \"settle down.\" What we got instead is the lack of genuineness of their romance. They could've shown how serious Barney was, and could've shown the challenges in him changing his ways with less outlandishness and with more seriousness. Instead, the writers just put the big red nose on the character, and refused commit to the character's new self and opted for cheap laughs over genuine moments. This episode showed what is wrong with the show this season. The characters have become so outlandish and predictable.  What bothers me is that the show use to be so much better at showing Barney's depth. As early as season 1's \"Game Night\" and as recently as last season's \"Tick Tick Tick\" Barney gets to show emotional depth without being sold out for a cheap laugh. You nailed this season's problems when you say they have been to focused on his zany hijinks and pretending this doesn't undo a lot of the development the character has had over 7 seasons and they pretend to show he's having this year.        Did I miss something, or did the playbook teleport to Ted's place? Robin found the playbook on Barney's couch, got mad and left, then it goes to Marshall and Lilly at the art show, then all of a sudden Jeanette finds the playbook on Ted's couch... what? Robin walked into Ted's place and saw it on the couch. They weren't at Barney's.

She would have her own boring stories with her teacher friends. \n\nLilly would've taken Robin too, not consciously, but Robin would've drifted off with her. \n\nRobin and Ted never would've had a back and forth relationship and Ted wouldn't have idolized her as much, and neither would Robin and Barney. \n\nBecause Barney doesn't see the True Love that is Marshall and Lilly, his desire for a monogamous relationship is postponed by 10 years at least. He eventually finds someone, a divorcee with kids who Barney step-dads well. He is ecstatic when they have kids of their own and Barney becomes Pop-pop. \n\nTed continues on his journey for \"the one\" and eventually finds her. This might even happen sooner since Lilly isn't around to break up Ted and his girlfriends. \n\nMarshall eventually falls in love again, and again, and marries. He relishes his wife and the life they've made together, is happy to be picked over lifelong ambition. The wife is also a lawyer, they have a lot in common. But things happen and they end up divorced within five years. No children were had.  Niiiice. I didn't mean to kill the discussion, as I think it is an interesting scenario. \n\nI think Lilly would be the worst off- she looses a husband, the majority of her friends, and still doesn't have the art career she dreamed of. \n\nI think Marshall would be really bad off for awhile because he's heartbroken and distrustful of loving, plus he never had the single 20's to figure out how to date and meet women and how to act after one night stands. \n\nRobin's life would be significantly more boring as she loses shenanigans like crashing the prom with Lilly to check out a band for the wedding, and doesn't have bro-time with Barney at lazer tag.\n\nBarney and Ted are the most unaffected in one way, yet not having Robin around will allow each to move on to other relationships, and so the M and L breakup also has  huge ramifications for these two. \n\nWho knew the show rests on M and L's shoulders? Ha! /talking to myself. Wasn't the prom crashing before Lily decided to leave for SF? And Robin and Ted didn't know about Marshall and Lily's breakup until after they'd gotten together, so maybe they would have stayed together for even longer than they did?

Something about her makes me want to turn off the TV. Wasn't her biggest fan on HIMYM, but how the hell did you hate Elliot?   To be honest, I can't really think of a likeable girl Ted's dated on the show. Maybe it's because everything comes from his point of view, but apart from Robin, they certainly make it seem that it's always the other girl's fault for being crazy or needy or weird; it just takes a while for Ted to realize it. Ted can do no wrong in relationship terms...even with Victoria we eventually find out she's almost as guilty as he is (from his point of view at least). I liked the mother's roommate, Cindy or so. But that's actually a really good point you made, that most women Ted has dated seem to be unlikable because he tells the story and they are his exes. I liked season 1 Victoria  yeah...then they completely destroyed her character :/ No, Klaus did. Effing German.\n\nEdit: Fuzzy Nomenclature\n\nEdit 2: singular German She only fucked 1 German as far as we know. Given a normal dating cycle vs length of time in country, Imma haveta disagree. Except she started dating Klaus a day after breaking up with Ted (presumably whilst being faithful until then) then 6 years later she almost gets married to the same Klaus after moving back to NY. So unless she cheated on Ted or Klaus in germany (there is no suggestion she did sleep with anybody else) her total count is 1 German. No, Klaus did.

Victoria did to klaus what Stella did to Ted. She is just as bad  Klaus was doing the same thing to her. Clearly they weren't right for each other. True but it just means they are all at fault and Ted shouldn't have supported Victorias actions because he knew what being left at the altar did to him.  Ted fought her on it, though. He pushed the issue until she laid it out plainly for him, \"I left him for you.\" It was basically only on the fact that she would leave him a note that he decided to continue driving into the sunset. Victoria did to klaus what Stella did to Ted. She is just as bad  I still freaking love Victoria. We all do.   We all do.   I feel like the only person in this entire subreddit who actually hates Victoria. I hate her too. She has nothing memorable about her. She's boring and plain-looking too.

Every single time. \nI hate Robyn and how she has abused Ted.\nOh and she marries one of Ted's best friends. So, I'm not going to downvote your opinion, 'cause that's not what downvoting is for. However, to begin with, Stella knows what she did to Ted was horrible. That's made clear in the episode As Fast As She Can (S4E23). She also knew it was necessary. The movie Tony made was from a very slanted point of view, and pretty much warped every detail of the relationship, so I'm really not sure if I'm reading it correctly that you're using the movie as an accurate account of what happened.\n\nOn to Robin: You're looking at it from a very narrow point of view. As a guy who relates to Ted a lot, I tend to see all of the things he's doing wrong because I do the same things. If you're a romantic like Ted, then you'll have seen all of the cheesy movies where persistence pays off, and think that's how real life works, and well, it sort of does. Persistence in Ted's case paid off in getting Robin to like him, but he knew from the start that she didn't want the whole marriage and kids thing. They both just ignored it, and that was very evident in their break up (\"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\"). When Ted kissed Robin (yes, Ted kissed her, not the other way), she told him beforehand that there was no off switch to his wanting to settle down, and he disagreed. When Robin comes back from Argentina with rebound guy, she tries to be nice about it with Ted, which ends up making Ted that much more jealous, but she did try. As far as sticking around, I think Lily had a lot more to do with that than Robin. She (Lily) even talks with Ted about how Robin is one of their friends now too, and she's going to be around after they break up. When two exes live together, the relapse sex is a risk you take. In that scenario, Ted broke it off because of Barney, not because of anything either of them felt at the time. I fail to see how the apprentice thing is relevant. Ted wasn't trying to date her at the time, and even if he was, just because a guy likes a girl that he has a history with doesn't mean that girl should just stop dating for him (I had to come to this realization on my own when I was younger and more annoying).\n\nFinally, I know it's not a big deal, but since there has been a character that is not Robin that was specifically named Robyn, I would suggest getting used to spelling it with an 'i' to prevent any misunderstandings. This post is perfectly clear, but others might not be. SPOILERS!!!! MUST BE CAUGHT UP TO READ.\n\n\n      I have to respectfully disagree.

To be fair, all of the single characters have glass-shattering annoyances. But ummmm, I don't see how that relates to the discussion about Ted's girlfriends. They are (also) single? Did you not catch that reference? They are (also) single? To be honest, I can't really think of a likeable girl Ted's dated on the show. Maybe it's because everything comes from his point of view, but apart from Robin, they certainly make it seem that it's always the other girl's fault for being crazy or needy or weird; it just takes a while for Ted to realize it. Ted can do no wrong in relationship terms...even with Victoria we eventually find out she's almost as guilty as he is (from his point of view at least).  Sorry, but I can't hate Stella for this. Not when Ted provided the means for his own undoing.\n\nFrom the start, Ted was insistent that they date, even as Stella continually rejected him. He knew she had baggage: a daughter; hasn't slept with anyone since her ex-boyfriend, father of their daughter, five years prior; unwilling to commit to a relationship with Ted. The signs are all there, yet Ted kept pushing to make it happen. He was rushing the relationship, and even admitted not knowing her *that* well. To top it off, he invited her ex to their rushed wedding (a wedding, btw, which was originally someone else's that they took over).\n\nThis is Ted being Ted, trying to take shortcuts and desperately wanting to find that feeling of being with *the one*. He forced this idea so hard, I can't help but feel sorry for all parties involved. But ultimately, the pursuit of the relationship, the evolution of the relationship, and the demise of the relationship were almost all entirely thanks to Ted's impulsiveness. (Which is why we like the guy, right? I mean, not as much as we used to, but that's for another post) Please, you're pinning all that on Ted? She had to agree to go out with him and she chose to marry him. You don't make that decision lightly, so it sounds like she jumped into something she wasn't ready for and Ted got hurt.\n\nEdit: spelling Sorry, but I can't hate Stella for this.

(Which is why we like the guy, right? I mean, not as much as we used to, but that's for another post) Everything you mentioned took 2 people to do.  Yes things we're rushed but she never told Ted she didn't want to do any of those things. Except the original date, but that was played off as her being \"hard to get\". \n\nIt seems like your argument is that she was crazy and damaged so it was Ted's fault because he should have known she was?  Yes, Stella was at fault, but not solely at fault. Her biggest crime was accepting Ted's proposal (leaving him at the altar was bad, but getting married was an even worse idea...they were obviously meant to be with other people, so I applaud her \"bravery\" and remaining true to her feelings). Remember: *Ted's* proposal. She did not pursue the relationship, and was satisfied with just being friends from the very beginning.\n\nThere were many red flags, and no one forced Ted to do any of these things. I do not think she was crazy. She was a single mom who raised a nice daughter, and she had a successful dermatology practice which she commuted to several times a week. She seemed more well-adjusted than any main character outside of Marshall. Emotionally damaged? I won't go that far. Everyone understood that she had baggage though.  I agree she was damaged but not more so than anyone else on the show. Yes Ted is the one that pursued her. \n\nBut I disagree that just because Ted was the one that initiated and pursued her, means that it going wrong was his fault. One person asks, the other accepts (or not). Once you've committed then it's \"their\" engagement not Ted's engagement. \n\nI agree that for her, she probably had no choice. If she loved Barry? Then she couldn't marry Ted. But that doesn't absolve her of the fact that she is leaving Ted at the altar and breaking his heart. What she's doing is still hurting him, she just has a good reason (to her).  At the time, it was somewhat foolish for them to be engaged. It was even more foolish to move up the wedding date. And it was damn foolish to invite Tony, her ex and father of her child, to the wedding. \n\nWe don't really know what exactly went on through her mind at the time. If she was in love with her ex the whole time and she knew it, AND she decided to get married to Ted despite that, it's pretty awful to not tell him these things. I don't think she's evil or manipulative so I think she didn't realize what she truly wanted, until after seeing Tony. \n\nTry to put yourself her situation. You think you want to get married to this person. But this same person throws your ex (with whom you are not on speaking terms) back into your life, and now you realize that you would truly be happy with your ex. Do you get married anyway? It won't work. The lesser evil is preventing this huge mistake of a marriage from happening in the first place and breaking his heart now rather than later. I don't think she is a bad person for this. She's just...a person. I agree with everything you said. It was foolish for both of them to do what they did, but only in hindsight. In their situation, like you said, they didn't really know what they wanted. Heck she may not have even known she had feelings for her ex until faced with the situation of being at her wedding to marry someone else and having your ex there. \n\nShe did the right thing (from our pov), but like you said, it was the lesser of two big evils. In the end though, it was her that decided to leave Ted at the altar on their wedding day. Even if she couldn't marry Ted, she could have spared his feelings by calling off the wedding, talking to him, and maybe take some time to figure herself out. \n\nBut instead she runs away with her ex husband, leaving Ted wondering what's happened, with just a note trying to explain. Plus he had to face the guests alone, and basically clean up the mess. \n\nOf course all this makes good tv, so there's that, but you have to admit, the way she did what she had to do was pretty dickish.  I would have rather her leave Ted at the alter than he have a shitty first marriage. What I am saying and I think what Ted was saying, it turned out for the best.  I couldn't hate Stella easily because I like Elliot to much.     Hint: Black out her last name. Or white it out.  Or perhaps purple it out. The world is your oyster. Way to kill a joke. I thought it was amusing. Hint: Black out her last name. It's not her real name. It's a joke in my phone.

This discrepancy with *The Final Page* I'm going to chalk up to Barney made Ted a copy of the Playbook, but forgot about it. Or, Barney does magic tricks and never burned it to begin with.  I'm a little disappointed that The Playbook still exists because to me it takes a little away from The Final Page. I thought it was a significant step for Barney to destroy it; one of the things that made me believe Barney was ready. Now I know it's all a lie... :\\ Agreed. This is what pisses me off about the writers from time to time. We don't know that exact situation though. He could have destroyed his copy and this can be a copy he gave to Ted a long time ago. Yeah, but I am not feeling so hopeful right now. You're absolutely right though, it could be just a copy Ted has, but I am getting a little tired of the playbook joke. That's just me though. I agree they're dragging this a little bit too much, but I remember that, after the episode where Barney burned the playbook, people have noticed the copy they showed looked differently. Let's hope they've figured a good way to bring it back and it won't wipe out Barney's big decision.        I bet that Ted and that girl are going to break up at the end of this episode!!!! because we know that their relationship Literally Goes up in flames, and in that last picture she is holding (I think it's the playbook) with fireworks shoved inside.

I'm at the part where Robin is in the bathroom crying because of Ted, and Victoria, standing outside Robin's stall, hands her [spoiler] (/s \"the bouquet of flowers under the stall. This tradition implies that the person whom the bouquet is handed to is next to be married.\") Now, following that line of thought, and barring anyone outside of the group, this foreshadows [spoiler] (/s \"Robin getting married with Barney. You might think that Lily and Marshall get married first, but they were already engaged\") \n\nThe writers didn't plan it, but it played out that way. At least that's what I think.   What a catch. Never ever would have even thought of that. Good job.  Robin's also the one who catches the bouquet at Marshall and Lily's wedding. Will The Mother catch the bouquet at Robin's wedding? I can see Robin with her canadian strength chucking it far enough it goes to the band You just blew my fucking mind. And really, that's the mind he uses most of the time. Now he's going to have to use the regular one. Think of all the fucking he might miss out on! Oh, the productivity! Robin's also the one who catches the bouquet at Marshall and Lily's wedding.  What if, through some zany series of plot twists and antics from the Gang, Ted catches the bouquet and it injures his hand? What if, through some zany series of plot twists and antics from the Gang, Ted catches the bouquet and it injures his hand? That would be nice. Every other theory I've seen so far is kind of sad and related to Ted still being in love with Robin, this one is far more optimistic and turned to his future. \n\nWhen do they usually do the bouquet stuff in American weddings, after the ceremony or after the reception (we've seen [spoiler] (/s \"his hand is ok at one point during the reception\"))?  They do the bouquet/garter toss during the reception.  At the ones I've been to it's pretty late in the reception, right before the bride and groom leave. Thanks, so the theory could tie up with what we've seen until now. It could.  Ted may tussle for the garter, and that's how he hurt his hand.  But that wouldn't exactly explain why he's at the train station alone.  Maybe he's so depressed that he *didn't* get the garter that he just decides to leave.  I don't think they say what time it is in that episode, but it's clear he left near the end of the reception due to the fact that the mother, who was playing in the band at the reception, shows up just moments later.  So I don't know that Ted left early or was asked to leave, like some people speculate (unless he was waiting for a train for hours, which doesn't seem likely, but I don't know much about train schedules).  Hmm... I guess we'll just have to wait.\n\nedit:  I agree that the other theories about Ted being in love with Robin are rather sad.  I truly hope he's well over her by then.  I want the last few episodes before the wedding, if not earlier, to prove that.  It's possible he could punch someone, but  if that's true it  would have to be someone being and enormous jackass, otherwise the mother (if she sees) may not like him after that and he *would* be asked to leave by Barney/Robin.  Ted says he's only ever been in one fight.  Maybe throwing one punch doesn't count at a fight if the other person doesn't fight back?  Maybe he punches a wall in frustration that he's still alone.  I just hope it's not something related to being in love with Robin still, especially since he meets the mother later that day and is supposedly in love with her right away, Yeah, I'm not sure anymore if we have to think he left earlier because of some kind of accident. The flashforward confirms he didn't leave until some time during the reception, and his hand is ok at that point. That kind of kills the theory of Ted bursting into tears while making the toast at the begining of the reception, confessing his feelings, cutting his hand and being asked to leave. You are correct about the punching theory. It's possible one punch doesn't count as a fight. If he punches someone who is acting crazy for some reason, chances are he wouldn't be asked to leave. Brad was openly pursuing Scooter at Lily and Marshall's wedding, and was walking around half naked, yet he wasn't asked to leave. \n\nI am begining to think that whatever happens to his hand is not directly related to him leaving. Maybe it's just another random thing that goes wrong that day. Maybe Ted will do his best to perform all his duties, and, at the end of the day, he'll just be confronted to his emotions, and will realize he's in the same place as when the story began. He could have plans for the night, but, feeling sad and alone, he could decide to go home by train.\n\nAs for the bouquet, I don't know if he could be upset because he didn't get it. I live in Europe and most people I know seem to think it's a tradition for one of the girls to catch it. I am pretty sure a guy here wouldn't try to get it, and he wouldn't be upset if he didn't (though it would still be considered symbolic if it happened). Of course, it could be different elsewhere, and knowing all the jokes they made about Ted's emotions, that kind of scenario wouldn't be so strange.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/18zj7b/writers_of_himym_youve_done_it_again/", "id": 77, "title": "Writers of HIMYM, you've done it again.

That wasn't nice  He's a rich bitch... he's had plenty of high-horse moments, but ultimately his good nature comes through... sort of. Well, to be fair in this instance he was only interested in making amends with Lily since she managed to pick a painting that increased a lot in value. I was really expecting him to apologize about what he said True, but at the same time, just moments after she left, he went and bought the painting based simply on the fact that she said she liked it... not TOO bad of a guy. That doesn't make him a nice guy at all! That means that he thought she was right, but still insulted her anyway. The definition of mean.  Except what he said to Lily! That wasn't nice  I don't think it came out as mean-mean, she was just a kindergarten teacher, but he followed her advice which means he trusted her enough to buy the painting. Yeah but even if he followed her advice, it was still a mean thing to say Read upthread. Since the whole episode was about misremembering the party, it could be that he didn't say it nearly as harshly as Lily remembered it. It could have been a passing comment which Lily interpreted to be much more mean-spirited. Considering that it never came up that Lily was a teacher, how would he even have known?

I watch the show sometimes frustrated that fictional character Marshall didn't play the field more in the fictional HIMYM universe and meet a girl cooler than Lily. /endrant I've defended Lily many times before, but here we go again.\n\n&gt;Who repeatedly sabotages their friend's relationships?\n\nJust Ted's - and it's generally for the right reasons. She didn't sabotage his relationships with Victoria and Stella, two women that she saw as a good fit for them (and yes, she bet against him, but she didn't actively make the attempt - Ted made a mistake many of us might make). With Robin, she didn't intend to, and she had a very cogent point in trying to make them talk things out about the future and how it could lead to a much more bitter breakup than their clean one back in season two.\n\nShe learned from the fight that she and Ted had and swore off doing it, which showed personal growth. She faces a moral dilemma when it comes to Barney and Robin - she doesn't want to until it becomes glaringly obvious to her that there is seemingly no better alternative, only brought 'out of retirement' at Marshall and Ted's urging seeing their downward spiral.\n\n&gt;Couple that with the fact that she thinks she 'settled' for Marshall\n\nAfter Marshall badgers her into oblivion about it - and even then, her determining that she must be the 'settler' was shown to be false when she attacked Jenkins for kissing him, a pretty clear sign that their relationship dynamic isn't the one that Ted and Robin instilled in his mind. Logically you'd think she'd know otherwise, given the circumstances that led up to her and Marshall getting back together in the first place was because Lily was mad jealous about Chloe. It could just an ego thing that she'd put herself in that position given Marshall's obvious insecurity.\n\n&gt;abandons her friends on occasion\n\nYou mean when she left Marshall for San Francisco? It's harder to defend this, but for someone who had this idea about what they wanted to accomplish before settling down, that's a lot of gravity you can't just dismiss for very long. She freaked out. I can understand to a point. When she almost ditched Marshall for Spain, you have to admit that being that supportive really would push her to wit's end. It'd be better if she had just been honest in that regard, admittedly, but I think she thought she was between a rock and a hard place.\n\n&gt;lies about credit card debt to her fiance when she got engaged\n\nIt's not exactly uncommon to hide your problems from your significant other until you can't hide it any longer. When push came to shove, she wanted to take responsibility for her actions by trying to pay it down herself and trying to keep her name off of the mortgage. \n\n&gt;meddles in other people's lives\n\nWith good intent. You can't honestly claim to not meddle in the affairs of your friends' lives - we do it everyday just by talking about what everyone else is talking about concerning your little group or whatever.\n\n&gt;is unable to keep a secret\n\nAll gossipy stuff, nothing that would actively harm another's life.\n\n&gt;and steals shit from people who are mean to her\n\nYeah, this is another one of those flaws that are hard to defend, so I'll concede to this. \n\nMeh. I'd still be friends with her. Then again I tend to be attracted to and care more for crazy girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n This post reminded me of why i dislike Lily so much.

I sincerely hope there'll be more growth for her to be less manipulative and such. Perhaps that's why they brought back the \"Lily Justice\" thing. I'm hoping that, as she grows up, she'll realize she CAN'T do all the things you just ranted about, and will simply allow her friends to make the choices she thinks aren't all that great, but will support them because she cares for them.

Marshal is an idiot with no inherent morality and Lilly is just a bad person. Marshall's a lawyer. Meaning he has a huge sense of morality and he's very intelligent. &gt;a lawyer\n\n&gt;huge sense of morality \n\n&amp;#3232;\\_&amp;#3232;...Maybe personally, yes, but I doubt Marshall was employing his sense of morality while working for GNB as long as he did. Probably hated hearing himself on occasion. \n    It good that she got the job, but it doesn't seem too realistic that she would get a job like that. I d'unno, if I was the one that bought a painting like that at her behest and made $4 million off of it I'd certainly be calling her back to see what else she might have in mind, which is probably what The Captain intends to do. It'd be cool if they show here and there how she does in that regard.

Esp. if they did it before they introduced the mother in the show. It doesn't seem like a bold prediction since the producers basically said something to the effect of, \"If you're turning on the tv and HIMYM is on, there will be an obvious way to tell if the episode is or is not one from the final season.\" Wait...what?  I'm not \"predicting\" it. You are.  I'm just saying your idea would be a cool way to really toy around with the audience. Wait...what?  I wasn't saying you were predicting it.\n\nOne of the things I was hoping to learn from this thread:  Is it just assumed that we'll see the mother at the end of this season?  Or is it assumed that Ted will meet the mother?  Or do we know for sure either? Oops. Sorry. \n\nThere are many schools of thoughts on that matter. I think with the announcement of the new season, they are probably going to reveal the mother in the next season.  How, or when, is really up to the writers.

Other interesting notes for those who don't want to read the entire thing:\n\n* Marshall had a thing where he would diagnose himself with ridiculous diseases (farfetched things even for HIMYM) for the smallest symptom. His character also comes off as a lot wimpier than Segel's eventual portrayal.\n* Ted is WAY creepier when he talks to the Lebanese girl about how planned out his future is.\n* They overdo the pirate references for Lily's eye patch. \n* One of the funnier cut scenes took place right when the group drops Ted off at Robin's place after he steals the blue horn. Ted promises the others he will give them a signal that it's okay to leave by calling them and letting the phone ring once. In the apartment Robin says line after line that makes Ted pull out the phone, then put it away, then pull it out, and put it away as he anticipates the possibility of an overnight stay.\n* When Robin and Ted talk on the couch after he admits he loves her, she admits she would have slept with him if he hadn't said that.\n* Lily and Marshall buy champagne while waiting for Ted to get out of Robin's apartment. They are happy because the cap is a twist-off. They end up getting arrested. Barney just sits there and watches. Marshall calls Barney a douche.\n\nAnother thing I noticed too...even the dialogue that was kept seemed not to be as good as I remember from actually watching the end result (but that's typical when reading screen/teleplays). Makes you appreciate the exceptional casting of the five leads, because a LOT of these jokes would have come off as really dumb if they had gotten only decent actors.

Just my thought on it.  Okay so here's my idea.  We've already seen the scene at the Barney and Robins wedding reception where Ted sees the mother playing bass.  So what if leading up to that the wedding band starts playing Hey Beautiful initiating Future Ted making a speech about destiny/fate and how everything up to that day, even that moment had to happen in order for him to be ready to meet the mother. At about the breakdown of the song (where the vocals pretty much disappear) a montage of all of Teds girlfriends over the years. Not necessarily all off them but Robin, Victoria, Stella, and Zooey for sure. Possibly starting and ending with Robin. This montage ends as the wedding band gets to the ba ba ba ba part at which point Future Ted looks up at the band and sees the mother and hopefully we get to see her too. Then the song ends and we're left with Ted looking at the mother and the season ends presumably with Ted summing up his entire speech with an impactful sentence. And the season ends and we all get upset that we have to wait for them to meet in Season 9.  I have uneasy feelings about season 9.   I'd be okay with this if they were going to end it with a montage, 'cause it would be cool to have the song play all the way through with clips of Ted and the mother dating, getting married, having kids, etc., all ending with the familiar part of the song.\n\nIt's looking more and more like they're going to meet at the beginning of S9 though, so I don't know. As much as I would love the show to keep going I really don't think it will be as good if it continues on after he meets her.    This is gonna sound very corny. But how about before Ted sees her, Hey Beautiful starts playing. Future Ted talks about fate and love and how easy it would have been for him not to meet the mother while Hey Beautiful is still playing faintly in the background. Then when the Ted's eyes see the mother, the \"Ba Ba Ba Ba\" part starts playing.   I think Ted mentioned he shares a love for Otis Redding with the mother. If I remember correctly, and the creators know what they are doing, we'll get Otis.\n\nedit: correction, it was [the girl from the agency](http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/Ted%27s_Love_Solutions_Match) but she did have staff like the bass that the mother has, and it's still possible she's the mother.   Murder Train needs to play.  It would be cool but the thing is, the only good part of that song is the ending - the rest of it is really sucky. I know that's just a personal opinion, but even generally speaking, aside from the ending of the song, it doesn't carry any emotional resonance. \n\nI'd be pretty disapointed if they used that - especially when they've nailed so many music moments before.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/18qx6w/music_that_plays_when_ted_meets_her/", "id": 132, "title": "Music that plays when Ted meets her"}, {"snippet": "   Ted's face when he orders them is priceless!    now i am thinking about nachos. fucking 6am and I want nachos. thanks.

You can chalk it up to lazy writing or genuine suspense, but either way my concern is that the writers are making it increasingly difficult for them to convince the audience that Ted really is over Robin.\n\nWe've already been told and shown, multiple times, that Ted has gotten over Robin only for that to be reversed. They continue this EVEN after Barney and Robin become engaged.\n\nMy real concern is that they won't really address it. If they just have Ted fall in love and stop pursuing Robin cold turkey, I don't know that it will be very convincing. Even if they make it love at first sight, Ted had that with Robin, AND he had an additional eight years of pursuing her.\n\nI found a post on a random website that captured my thoughts pretty well:\n\nhttp://www.fanforum.com/f289/blue-french-horn-lovers-%7Bt%E2%99%A5r%7D-8-because-marshall-doesnt-want-pay-lily-up-yet-63076360/index10.html\n\n&gt;The first episode explains it all. Ted falls in love with Robin instantly. From the moment he met her, he knew it was love and that love has endured through 8 seasons. Every time Ted tries to move on, Robin is always in the back of his head and he will choose her over anyone, no matter how special they are supposed to be to him. \n\n&gt;I think that with the mother being the \u201cbass player\u201d at the wedding, or maybe someone who meets him at the stop, or however they are going to explain it to us, is \u201csupposed\u201d to show us that Ted falls in love with the mother at first sight, maybe signifying he\u2019s officially over Robin.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t really think they know what they are doing. How is just one \u201clove at first sight\u201d moment going to replace that + the many years that he\u2019s spent pining privately and openly about Robin. How are we supposed to just \u201cforget\u201d all of his feelings about her because he sees this women across a room just like he did with Victoria, Stella, and the many others he\u2019s been with. It doesn\u2019t make the mother anything special, just another one of Ted\u2019s brief hookups. \n\n&gt;I know that all the theories and the timeline have canceled out any hope of Robin being the mother or the woman future Ted marries, I\u2019m not one of those delusional shippers. But why? What amazing thing is the woman going to do to prove to us Ted loves her more or just as much as he\u2019s loved Robin all these years.  Ted is over Robin. Ted just wants to be married. His Ted-ological clock is ticking away, and he's super jealous and probably a bit depressed that his two friends who are so totally anti-marriage are getting married before him, and to each other no less. All he needs this time to get through his jealousy is a girl of his own (maybe one who isn't completely insane, too) &gt;Ted-ological clock\n\n:D\n\nI see what you're saying, but I personally don't really feel like they've established that Ted has gotten over Robin. You may be right that it could just be jealousy at this point, but I don't see anything solid in the last two seasons to show that. I think the will show the door is closed during the wedding. I never really got the idea he was into her in the first place. Anytime they hooked up after the first dating period it was right when he was on the rebound. Every time they broke it off it barely phased him. If he really did have true feelings for her the \"fuck buddy\" period would have never worked. She was no more than his security blanket.  Ted is over Robin. Ted just wants to be married.

All he needs this time to get through his jealousy is a girl of his own (maybe one who isn't completely insane, too)   This reminds me of the time that Marshall said \"not yet\" when they though Ted was finally over Robin. That has to play into something later on in the series. \n I loved that - that scene sticks out the most for me as a Ted/Robin foretelling. As illogical as I think Ted &amp; Robin are at this point, that line makes me want it so badly.   How will we see Ted is over Robin? Easy: He'll bring out the notepad and do some pros/cons between Robin and the mother. How will we see Ted is over Robin? Easy: He'll bring out the notepad and do some pros/cons between Robin and the mother.  I'm guessing that he'll meet the mother in a state of emotional crisis (crying over Robin most likely) and something about that will cause him to fall even harder for her... Either way I totally get what you're saying. Ted and Robin have something so special and it's hard to see some random bass player eclipsing that. Interesting idea with the emotional crisis. He does meet her at the train station, right? Do we know yet why Ted finds himself at the train station after Barney and Robin's wedding? My guess is something akin to this.\n\nTed was nervous/upset the day of the wedding hence him peeling the label off the beer. My guess is Robin panicked and asked Ted to run away with her. He struggles and struggles and then they go just like Ted and Victoria. He takes her to the train station and tells her he can't/won't. She leaves without him, and there in the moment he relinquishes the purple giraffe he meets the yellow umbrella. She offers Ted shelter from the rain Ted looks up at her and confesses eternal love. Because that is how Teddy Westside does it. So they run away *after* she's married?  Because we've seen the father/daughter dance. Did we? Shiiiiittt. I must revise then. We have.  It was just a glimpse, I believe near the end of an episode.  Ted is watching the mother play while Robin dances with her dad, smiling.  Ted's hand is still unbandaged at this point. How do you know it's the mother? Cindy's former roommate is the mother. Cindy's former roommate is the bass player in Barney and Robin's wedding band.\n\nIt may not be airtight, but it's pretty solid. No I know but I figured that she didn't make it to the wedding. Because he didn't meet her until the train station. My guess is something akin to this.\n\nTed was nervous/upset the day of the wedding hence him peeling the label off the beer.

She'll come to her senses, agree and go through with the wedding happily. Interesting idea with the emotional crisis. He does meet her at the train station, right? Do we know yet why Ted finds himself at the train station after Barney and Robin's wedding? I don't think so... But it seemed like the train was the easiest way to get to/from the church? Yeah, it kind of seems the train is the best transporting option if you're on your own (no car or anything else), as shown with Klaus. Still, it's a curious thing Ted is alone at the station. One would think that as a best man he'd leave late and would have planned to have some kind of transportation or a place to stay for the night. Isn't there a hotel right in the church, or something like that? Interesting idea with the emotional crisis. He does meet her at the train station, right? Do we know yet why Ted finds himself at the train station after Barney and Robin's wedding? Here's a theory I have posted on here before that I came up with:\n\nAlright here's what I think what will happen, But what show is without it's final bit of drama before the happy ending? Robin will find out after Barney proposes and in a sheer moment of panic and lust will sleep with Ted, both he and Robin will be racked with guilt until the day the wedding. Robin asks to see Ted to find out if she wants to run away with him out of panic but here we see Ted's growth and he rejects Robin's idea and calms her down. Then Ted goes to see Barney and admits what he did to him and they fight(which leads to his injured hand)and he gets asked to leave the wedding. That's why Ted seems dejected but kind of satisfied at the train station he may have lost a friend but won his self respect back. Now for the next point you'll have to have seen My Name is Earl, in one episode Earl describes Karma not working as a point system but sometimes one more good deed will put you over the top. Because he's atoned for his sin and put his own selfish desires aside for the greater good he finally gets to meet the mother and Barney forgives him.\n Here's a theory I have posted on here before that I came up with:\n\nAlright here's what I think what will happen, But what show is without it's final bit of drama before the happy ending?

However, the mother won't be bitchy like Victoria and ask Ted to not be friends with Robin. They'll end up having a talk about why their relationship isn't moving along like they want it to be, causing Ted to realize that it is Robin, and that at least for the sake of their relationship at that moment, Ted has to distance himself from Robin. Ted will have the \"talk\" with Robin explaining this, showing he truly is over Robin and how much he loves the mother.\n (Then the mother could show how awesome she is by telling Ted to not try and cut Robin out of his life. But Ted having the talk would prove how over Robin he is.) I think that when Ted falls for the mother, eventually things will start to slow down between them.

Remember the episode where Victoria told him that it (him, Barney, and Robin hanging out at the bar night in and night out) wasn't working, Narrator Ted said something like \"it didn't work... we just didn't realize it yet.\" And they've yet to realize it this far. Perhaps your scenario would be that realization? I think that when Ted falls for the mother, eventually things will start to slow down between them.

But Ted having the talk would prove how over Robin he is.) I think when you meet \"The One\" the emotional baggage gets eclipsed by all the good things going on with the right person. I'm not saying your scenario couldn't happen, but I'd rather see it become something that doesn't matter any more to Ted.  I think he's going to be looking at Robin while she's dancing with barney at the wedding and he'll look over her shoulder and see the mom and robin gets blurry in the shot and zooms in on her and end whole fucking series This sounds pretty cool, but Ted meets the mother at the train station. I'm fairly sure that has been established through interviews with the creators, which means he only sees her at the wedding, and they can't end it without them meeting.   It's called how I MET your mother. Not how I fell in love with your mother. You don't think that's incredibly cliche and anticlimactic at this point? For him to shake her hand or whatever and the show to cut to black? That's such a cop out.  How is that a cliche and anticlimactic if that's what was intended since the beginning? I think that's the right way to end the show. Really? You don't want to actually get to know the character we've spent 9 years following the story of? What makes her so special? What makes her better than Stella or Victoria or Robin or any of the other women Ted has dated? Its just so cheesey. I'm going to be pretty upset if they end it that way, although that seems to be the direction the show is headed. Hopefully we get Barney and Robin's wedding at the end of S8 or the beginning of S9 and can spend most of S9 getting to know her. Frankly, the way they've written the show (and seem to be headed), having Robin NOT be the mother is pretty incredibly lame. They've set her up as the perfect character for it.  Really?

[deleted] I also think it's possible season 9 will be told from the mother's perspective - and I might actually **enjoy** that. Of course, that possibility comes from the quote from the producers about how we'll never be able to mistake an episode from season 9 for an episode of any other season - it will be DRASTICALLY different.

Barney even said the date and we know Ted meets the mother at that wedding. It seems to me like the writers were *going* to end the series with Ted simply meeting the mother before they knew whether or not there would be a ninth season. Now that there is.

This is just like how Barney mentioned Karma a couple of seasons before he met Quinn. They didn't let that one line affect Quinn's/Karma's name. Not to be that guy, but that could have easily been a different stripper named karma. The point is that they are not going to hold themselves to a small line like that.\n\nedit: they never re-use names, so it had to be something they just either didn't realize or decided to disregard. How can you be so sure they don't re use names? Either way karma is an alias. They've never reused names in the past. But the point is that they don't needlessly hold themselves to minor/unimportant details. Except for karma. And yeah but why not?  They've never reused names in the past. But the point is that they don't needlessly hold themselves to minor/unimportant details. On the infographic of all of Ted's exes, aren't there two girls named Hollie and Holly? Who knows where they found out the spelling, but that counts as the same name to me. They've had plenty of one-time jokes that don't mean anything. Remember time traveling Marshall? I doubt they had the mother's name set that long ago. And they surely wouldn't set Tracy in stone just because of one small scene. This is just like how Barney mentioned Karma a couple of seasons before he met Quinn. They didn't let that one line affect Quinn's/Karma's name. But would the trick on his kids still have worked if Tracey wasn't the name he said? The kids ask in an earlier episode why he changed all of the women's names except robins so he would've done the same for Tracey  What episode is this? I don't remember it. Season 1 episode 9 \"Belly Full of Turkey\" That's the episode with Tracy the stripper, I know that, but I mean what's the episode where the kids ask why he changed names? But would the trick on his kids still have worked if Tracey wasn't the name he said? The joke was \"and kids, that's how I met your mother\"  not \"That's how I met your mother, Tracy\". The name was unimportant and just happened to be Tracy. Like I said, it was one line from years ago, not a significant plot point.  Well why use a name at all then? She said her stripper name and then in the part that I'm assuming Ted made up, she said but my real name is Tracy. If my dad were to do that and didn't use my moms name I wouldn't looked shocked, I'd be like: \"But that's not Mom's name.\" I don't know maybe I'm just smarter then Ted's kids and look too far into it. The point is, it was a joke that wasn't meant to be taken seriously. I feel like the person that wrote this joke didn't realize the implications that it would have on the future of the series. That being said, they are not going to hold themselves to a small detail like that. There's plenty of examples of times they have said something as a joke or minor plot point in the earlier seasons that they completely gloss over or disregard in the later seasons.\n\nNinja edit: And sorry for the downvotes, it's not me but it seems like people don't like when others try debating theories that they don't like :/       Audrey Hepburn?

If there is a better english word I'm not aware of, please tell me! You call the way one wears their hair a 'haircut' don't you? If there is a better english word I'm not aware of, please tell me! Hairdo.\n\nBut I was referring to how in one she has short hair and in the other one long hair. She couldn't possibly wear those hairdos with the same short hair, but I could be wrong. You call the way one wears their hair a 'haircut' don't you? If there is a better english word I'm not aware of, please tell me! Hair style? Just guessing here, english isn't my first language.  You call the way one wears their hair a 'haircut' don't you? If there is a better english word I'm not aware of, please tell me! Hairstyle or hairdo, because haircut implies the hair was actually cut. The hair was differently cut, not just differently styled or done. Wouldn't therefore the term *haircut* be more precise? If I say I got a haircut, it would imply I recently cut my hair.  But in the picture, it was obvious that she let her hair grow out, since it was short in 2029 and then long in 2030.  If she had cut it, it'd be even shorter. I always assumed there is a difference between 'getting a haircut' as the act of cutting hair and 'haircut' as the manner in which one's hair has been cut. Using the 'haircut' to mean that might be slightly ambiguous, but 'hairstyle' means exactly that.  So 'hairstyle' would be the preferred word.\n\nThis also may vary in different regions, so I should clarify that I'm in New York. Thank you! I probably made incorrect assumptions about the use based on how the translation would be used in my mother language. You call the way one wears their hair a 'haircut' don't you?

Anything in that happens in the show is being told to Ted's kids. Have the writers confirmed this? I haven't read much interviews and Ijust want to be sure. Yeah, in fact we've heard Ted tell us the opposite. For example when Robin is telling Ted why he's better than Gael (\"you're bigger\") we get to see that, but then Ted says to the kids, \"I can't remember what she told me, but I'm sure it wasn't something macho or immature\" etc. So it is definitely fair to assume that we are seeing more of the story than Ted's kids are hearing.  But he mentioned that he wasn't telling the whole story.... He does that on multiple instances too. It would actually prove the opposite of what you said.

I know Robin &amp; Barney do get married, but there's no mention of divorce.\n\nI'm of the mindset that it's nothing to worry about, but perhaps I'm wrong. I'm just sick of the back-and-forth between Robin &amp; Ted. \n\nPROOF: http://i.imgur.com/NDoasID.jpg  In the future, she would be wearing the wedding ring, not the engagement ring.\n\nMost likely this is a production oversite. Is Lily wearing hers in the scene? I believe Lily was wearing her ring in the future. In the 2013 portion of the show you can still see Robin's engagement ring and it is clearly gone when she flashes her hand in the future. 'Flashes' being the operative term here. She is quite clearly supposed to be hiding her hand throughout, meaning that whether the ring is there or not when she accidentally flashes her hand isn't significant, but rather the fact they're hiding it in the first place to create suspense. (Much like they did with Barney in Trilogy Time last season.) That's what confuses me. Why would they make Cobie hide her hand? It was understandable when Neil did it in Trilogy Time (since we knew a lot less on Barney's marriage) but now they've confirmed several times Barney and Robin will get married. I guess they could be doing this because of the people who are not reading spoilers and who could still wonder if they'll go through with the wedding.\nI just hope they're not planning on separating them in the future.\n I assume it's because they want to play up the suspense with the whole \"Wedding day that went horribly wrong\" thing. It makes very little sense at this point, since not only have they confirmed it in interviews that Barney and Robin do get married, but there was also the flashforward of Robin dancing with her father at the wedding. But then, considering there still are people who think Robin may be the Mother, I'm sure there are those who expect the wedding to fall through, too. It's possible that the hiding would be to suggest that the marriage might not last, but I find that very unlikely, considering how much build-up there's been, and the way they've been presenting Barney and Robin as \"the One\" for each other in the past seasons.\n\n(And for the record, she is definitely [hiding her hand on purpose](http://barneyrobin.livejournal.com/980851.html).)  I definitely agree. I'm not questionning if it was done on purpose, since it clearly seemed so to me (even though more natural than the Trilogy Time scene, mainly because of the way Cobie's scene was shot), I just fail to see their reasons. You're probably right about the fact there's still people who want Robin to be the mother and hope there'd be some final twist. I don't know what could possibly cause them to continue encouraging this theory, now that we know so many things about the mother.

I think I fell in love with Victoria before Ted did. I don't mean to sound pompous or anything. I just wanted it to be her even though I knew it couldn't be. I think she was the backup Mother just in case the series didn't continue to Season 2. Correct. Which always led me to believe that the Mother would never be Carly. She would be someone that was working at the wedding.   You forgot [this moment](http://sites.psu.edu/schneiderrclblog/files/2012/11/fat-barney.jpg).  Why the hell does nobody think this might happen again!? Because it wouldn't make sense story wise considering the whole character development they have gotten and their relationship build up for at least two seasons to be again squashed b/c of that. When i look at the quality of this seasons writing i'd say everything is possible.  Because it wouldn't make sense story wise considering the whole character development they have gotten and their relationship build up for at least two seasons to be again squashed b/c of that. It just seems like despite all that, the core bits of them that led to it are still there. The core being Barney's disinterest in relationships and Robin's fear of commitment? Those two are resolved. \n\nBarney has gotten his abandonment issues in control since knowing his father, and Robin is not afraid of commitment after she gave up the Chicago job for Don. Yeah, Don dumped her but the idea behind that relationship was that Robin could get over her fear of commitment. Why the hell does nobody think this might happen again!?

No one seems to remember how HORRIBLE they made each other feel when they were together the first time. \n\nSure, maybe they've grown as people and will work this time, but to me they feel really forced. \n\nI still don't think they'll get married.

I could be wrong, but I'll believe it when I see it. Robin's left hand was hidden in every scene from the future in the last episode.  They seemed to make a clear effort not to show a ring or lack thereof. They did the same thing with the flash-forward where Barney, Ted, and Marshall are watching Star Wars.\n\nHonestly, though, as much as I don't think it fits for them to be together, I'd rather let their drama end so we can get back to Ted and the Mother. Seems like Ted has been a supporting character these last seasons, instead of the focus. I'm fine with it, I agree, but I just feel like the producers have some twist up their sleeve.  Maybe they're just future-proofing current episodes, but I feel like that saga may not yet be finished.\n\nI agree about Ted though, I just wish they would do something worthwhile with him.  Lately I'd rather watch Lily or the Barnacle than anything to do with Ted's miserable life. I doubt it. The series will end next season. That's not really enough time to meet a new characters for barney, robin and Ted and have it all wrap up neatly.  They don't all have to end up happy/together!\n\nThere are always hijinx they can play.  I'm still waiting to hear something about a surrogate for Robin or the ol' switcheroo where the voiceover says \"Aunt robin is actually ____....\"  Especially as the series gets deeper into the constant renewal cycle. True. But I would rather the show focus more on Ted now. Let barney and riven be happy. The show doesn't need to be bogged down by going over them again. And I would find it really hard for them to stay friends if things don't work again. I mean things almost didn't work out for them when they first broke up and then barney started being unhappy and blah blah blah. We don't need to see all that again. Besides in the episode \"band or dj?\" It showed the reception. Those usually happen after a marriage. Then something happed and Ted hurts his hand and all that but they do get married. Maybe future Ted will say that many years down the line maybe the divorce or some thing.  Maybe barney and Robin get to the alter and...\n\nPreist: Do you take Robin?\n\nBarney: NO!\n\nRobin: Thank God! I don't either! Still bros?\n\nBarney: Bros! Let's go party at the already paid for reception! Maybe barney and Robin get to the alter and...\n\nPreist: Do you take Robin?\n\nBarney: NO!\n\nRobin: Thank God! I don't either!

Should this not have a spoiler tag?\n\n\n\nEdit: My mistake   Just gonna say it...anyone who says they saw it coming years ago is full of shit.\n\nThey have plugged the whole Ted/Robin thing the entire run of the show. It is only in the 6th season that they started planting these little seeds about Robin and Barney, and even that was only in a couple episodes (Subway Wars and Challenge Accepted).  Did you skipped season 4 and 5 ,seeds were sowed in season 3 actually when they first time hooked up. Did you skipped season 4 and 5 ,seeds were sowed in season 3 actually when they first time hooked up.

It is only in the 6th season that they started planting these little seeds about Robin and Barney, and even that was only in a couple episodes (Subway Wars and Challenge Accepted).  You know what was a really big giveaway that Ted would not wind up with Robin? The fact that Ted refers to Robin as \"Aunt Robin\" at the end of the pilot episode. \n\nI was sure they would end up together for a brief period of time, but eventually they'd break up. I didn't realize the entire show would be about Ted getting over Robin and the series of event that led him to the mother though.\n\nBarney has been planting seeds with Robin since season 1. He treats needy, clingy, stupid woman like garbage. Robin is the first girl he really seemed to respect and romantically like. The rest was just an inference - if you've ever hung out in a decent sized group of guys and gals, usually 2 fall for one another. Given the group comp (Marshall + Lily, Ted + future mosby, and barney/robin) it's not too much of a stretch for us to have seen them getting together. Of course he called her that, doesn't mean the show hasn't plugged it the whole time. \"Aunt Robin\" meant that she'll be that one that dogs him for years (according to how the show has gone). People need to realize (a lot like Lost fans) that there was no overall plan. Even this season they have said they've been stretching for plot because they didn't know how long they'd be going. \n\nBarney and Robin were only planned together from about the 6th season (period in between 5 &amp; 6 perhaps). Its just how it is, if fans want to believe more they can but they're diluting themselves. The two guys behind the show have stated they always knew the major points of the story - who was going to end up together, etc. So the rough outline was there. They just didn't know how much time they would have to tell the story. And sacrifices would have to be made (i.e if the show had shit ratings, Victoria would be the mother from S1). Those are just backups just in case you get cancelled in between, you dont wan't to leave a story REALLY fucked up and undone.\n\nRemember some aspects of the show are loosely based on their lives. Although if I recall correctly, I think that would cover Ted/Marshal + Lily, rather than the whole gang. \n\nOne of the things the directors are big on is putting in clues/foreshadowing events. Now what they imply may or may not happen, but people tend to make predictions based on these clues. And when they come true, it's that \"a-ha!\" moment, and the assumptions turned out to be right. If it goes down like that, they saw it coming. Now of course they're always the people who shoot in the dark and are right by chance, but I feel there's enough circumstantial evidence and hints through S1-8 to justify getting a feeling earlier than S6 barney and robin would wind up together. \n\nA bunch of factors come into play when it comes to writing (pandering to fans, changing major plot points to appease them) but I like to believe the directors when they say they knew from EP1 Barney would wind up with Robin because it makes perfect sense. I agree with you that the timing of it was an unknown variable (how many seasons would they run for, etc) but the event itself was given from day 1. They just admitted in the TVFanatic interview this last November that they didn't decide Barney and Robin would wind up together till the end of season 5. Interviews are inconsistent, but fans want showrunners to be all-knowing. They aren't. Most shows are pitched without a full concept. This is one of them. Ahh what the hell? Did not know that! My apologies then - I read a bunch of interviews with the showrunners from the end of S7 onwards (curious as to when the show was actually ending since it felt like it was dragging on). During Q&amp;A they claimed they knew Robin/Barney from the start. That's the only reason I was harping that point.\n\nOh of course. No point in a fully completed concept - if your ratings are garbage S1, the rest of your story will remain untold lol\n\nDo you happen to still have the source link for that interview? I'd be interested in reading it.  Ahh so they finally emasculated Barney ? \n\nnot shocked. \n Lol character development is now emasculation? no, Character development is awesome. \n\nBut completely changing the character, and having him do a 180 Degree turn from being a philandering ladies man, to a married, well behaved one is at best, jarring. \n\n They were in their mid to late 20s when the first season started, and now it's been 8-9 years in the show. I think after that many years of empty one night stands and gradual ventures into failed relationships, it makes sense for Barney to grow up and evaluate what he really wants out of life. They coaxed it out of him as well - Nora was one the first that made him realize he wouldn't mind settling down (which scared the crap out of him).\n\nYou think anybody ever real wants to be that 80 year old man trying to pick up chicks at a bar? Barney has proved several times that his persona is somewhat a facade right from the beginning. S1 / 2 all he does is shit on the idea of marriage - then he flies out to SF to get Lily back with Marshall (after keeping chicks away from Marshall). \n\nHe's not really well behaved either, he realized what Robin means to him and he's not going to fuck it up being stupid. Half his antics and humor came from chasing women and lying to them. Clearly he can't do that now that he's getting married.\n\nIf he would have changed that drastically from say, S1 to S3, i'd be calling BS as well. But after 8 seasons, I'll chalk it up to character development. Not that it really matters but I think Barney was 30 or 31 in the first season. Totally agree though upvote for you. I always thought he met Ted when they were the same age - 23. The Star Wars trilogy episode was a pretty good indicator of how old they actually are in the series No they definitely aren't the same age. During the hurricane episode Barney says \"I'm older than you.\" Ted says \"yeah?\" \"And taller\" \"no just older\" \"and when you get to reach my age and height...\" And just after sandcastles in the sand Ted asked how I feels to be thirty. True. Wikipedia said that Barney (76) is two years older than Ted (78). First season was 2005 or 2006, which would make them both in their late 20s ", "url": "http://imgur.com/e4LBF4r", "id": 158, "title": "We all saw it..."}, {"snippet": "  The pineapple!

For some reason, I have a hard time seeing a convicted rapist on a sitcom and thinking he's funny. I don't know why you're being down voted.  Honestly, I'm not sure why either. I didn't think not enjoying the antics of a rapist was a particularly controversial or unpopular stance. Apparently /HIMYM has some serious Tyson fans. Guy's seriously changed since the 80's. Sure, it doesn't absolve him from his past misdeeds, but he more than deserves a second shot. I have to disagree. I don't think he has changed all that much. But there's two separate issues here. 1. the issue of deserving a second chance and 2. whether a figure like him belongs on a light-hearted sitcom.\n\n1. What exactly has he done to earn his second chance?\n\nHe beat his wife Robin Givens (most likely, given her allegations and his statements that he has hit women) in the late 80's, raped her, raped an 18 year old in 1991 - went to prison and got out in 1995,  bit a man's ear off, assaulted two motorists in 1998, cheated on his wife Monica Turner throughout their marriage, had various kids in and out of wedlock that he could not provide for, in 2006 and 2007 DUIs and felony drug charges, another fight, at an airport with a photographer, in 2009.\n\nSupposedly he has been sober for 2 years now and started the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation in October of 2012. Of course he is more or less broke and in debt, so I am not sure what exactly the foundation is accomplishing.\n\nI am sure there is a lot I am leaving out. This is just a cursory glance at his wikipedia page and one google search.\n\nSo, does he deserve a second chance? Sure. A third chance? Um, maybe. A fourth chance? Why?\n\nYes, once a man has been punished for his crimes he should be able to rejoin society without being forever shackled to those crimes (for the most part). But that doesn't mean all avenues of employment are or should be open to them. And Tyson, he keeps acting badly, and doesn't really ever act goodly. His views on women are appalling and by all accounts he's pretty much an asshole. His soft and cuddly act is exactly that, an act. He's broke and needs money so he is trying to cash in on his notoriety by playing it for laughs.\n\nYou can choose to forgive the man his crimes and transgressions. But he hasn't really done much to earn that forgiveness.\n\n2 Now a man has a right to earn a living. But it's annoying that Bays and Thomas or whoever at CBS decided that this guy is A. entertaining, B. should be on the show. The first is subjective. The second is more objective.  To the first, I don't find him entertaining. I can't see past the rape and beatings and drugs to the loveable guy underneath. HIMYM has stunt cast before to varying degrees on success. I may not like Katy Perry much as an actress, but she is not morally objectionable. And at least to that extent I can attempt to find her entertaining whereas with Tyson, I can't. To the second, HIMYM is a romantic comedy tv show. I get that his name might boost ratings for an episode, but to cast a wife-beating rapist strikes me as a bad move that detracts from the series as a whole and the episode specifically. When I watch this show I don't really want to see Mike Tyson in it. Should he have been on the show? I don't think so.\n\n Wait, you're upset because Mike Tyson was putting on an \"act\" while acting?\nWhat in the actual fuck? Sorry I didn't make it clear. His newly acquired public persona in which he tries to make out that what he is portraying on screen, is who he is irl. I have to disagree. I don't think he has changed all that much.

Yes, but he's changed. Humans can change.\nHas Chris brown changed? Nope but he can dance and sing.\nIs Chris brown a bad person? Yes and I hope he changes because it would be tragic to have Boby and Whitney part two.\nIn conclusion:\nSome humans make mistakes and can be considered immoral because of it. Heck, some of them like being that way. Some change and some don't but regardless, it shouldn't affect your opinion of their work. Should it be brought up? Of course! Yet, I believe a person's work is separate. Mike Tyson was a character on an episode of himym. He was acting. He did a good job of portraying his character. He made some horrible decisions in the past and I hope that stays in the past because he's a halfway decent actor. I understand why it upset you and its a shame you can't forgive him for being dumb and I bet he's sincerely sorry for it. I bet he's apologized. I bet he wishes he never did it. Besides, who of us is without mistakes? We all fuck up.\n\nTl;dr: judge a person and their work separate because we all make mistakes. Nobody is perfect. I think we fundamentally disagree on this one point. I don't believe that a person's art needs to, or necessarily should be, separated from who they are as a person.\n\nI don't go see Roman's Polanski's films for much the same reason. I don't like financially supporting rapists.\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, this disagreement we are having is pretty much at the crux of why I think he should not have been on this show. His presence did not serve the story well, nor was it necessary in any way. It was off putting, upsetting, distracting, and, subjectively, not funny. I'm a male and I find this upsetting enough, but I'm sure that there are plenty of females who watch this show and were even more unhappy to see a man who has raped at least two women pop up on a Romantic Comedy show. \n\nMaybe on a show where his past misdeeds wouldn't be so out of place or off-putting, it would be OK. Like Law and Order SVU, where the fictional criminals are all worse than him.\n\nHis character on the show was him. His character in The Hangover was him. Mike Tyson. He is playing a version of himself, much the way James Vn Der Beek played JVDB on Apartment 23. It's image rehabilitation that I don't buy, nor do I want to buy by supporting a show that would enable him to do this. If he wants to rehabilitate his image, he should actually do something worthwhile with his life. \n\nI work in criminal law and I see people all the time who talk a big game, but really, they don't change. They are not sorry for what they have done. And given the chance, they'll continue to hurt people. And I often see them come back through the system after they have hurt people, again. But I have also seen people make the very real and difficult decision to change their lives for the better. He exhibits none of the traits associated with that. That I can tell. But, like you, I don't know the man personally. Maybe I'm wrong. \n\nBut it's about whether he is or isn't turning his life around. I hope he does. I just don't want to see his face on my tv watching an episode that is supposed to be light-hearted and fun.\n\nAnd Chris Brown - he's exactly what I am talking about - he has not changed at all. It's not hate that fills my heart, it's lack of pity for those who refuse to take responsibility for their actions and then take the necessary steps to get the help they need to never again commit those crimes.\n\nIf Chris Brown had been smart, he'd at least try to fake remorse and responsibility. But that's the problem with abusers, they don't have remorse for their actions, they don't accept responsibility for their actions. No matter how angry they get or how violent and inappropriate their outbursts are, there is always someone else at fault.\n\nI agree with you in pretty much all the details I do believe in second chances, I do believe that people make mistakes, I do believe that people have the power and capacity to change and we need to have a system set up that encourages and enables positive change. \n\nI have also seen men who most abjectly apologize, feel like shit for what they have done, swear to never do it again, and then fail to go to their AA meetings and their domestic violence classes and then they come back in a year or two later and their significant other is in the hospital on life support.\n\nYou talk about the past - I listed criminal conduct that was more or less continuous from the late 80's until a couple years ago. He's apologized? He feels bad? Who gives a fuck about his feelings. I care about the people he's hurt. \n\nAnd now I'm ranting. I'm sorry. That lowers the level of discourse. \n\nTLDR - You don't have to separate the man from his art, nor do I want to financially support a rapist doing image rehab, and ultimately I think it's in poor taste for this show to feature a rapist - rehabilitated or not. Guess you're not an NBA fan either\n\n guess not! Guess you're not an NBA fan either\n\n I think we fundamentally disagree on this one point.

I understand your particular distaste towards the act of financially supporting, in any direct or indirect way, someone who has commited violent crimes...\n\nbut your view on art is beyond arrogant and sanctimonious. It's people like you who SERIOUSLY put a stranglehold on art. You say that art can not be seperated from the artist, but that is if to say your moral system is a higher authority than the quality and value of the work of art or its value to society or those who appreciate it. It is simply illogical for you to believe that a work of art must be evaluated on the merits of its creator. \n\nEverything the film industry is now in terms of directing, cinematography, and editing is due to a man with known ties to the KKK. His very techniques are the very foundation of how the vast majority of film and television are structured. As a whole the film industry and community celebrate the work of a racist. \n\nContemporary horror and scifi owe a lot to HP Lovecraft, a man who was probably worse than a \"man of his times\" when it came to racism.\n\nLet's not even touch Thomas Edison...\n\nThe fact is that the merit of art will be passed down and the deeds and misdeeds of the creators will go mostly forgotten or turned into folk mythology. You can go back and play this game with any historical figure of importance, let alone mythological who man created and chose to worship. This has been how we've developed culturally and passed down tradition, information, and new ideas. \n\nYour PERSONAL ideals are noble, but it is just that. It is incredibly arrogant to believe it should dictate art.  Well, I never took quite so strong a stance as you state. You use CANNOT and MUST. I stated that I didn't think who a person is and what their art is need to or necessarily should be separated. You can accuse me of waffling, but I am aware of the point you are trying to make and trying to allow for it in my argument - that sometimes shitty people make things of great beauty - while at the same time trying to make my point that in this case.  \n\nI am curious as to exactly how people like put a serious stranglehold on art. If you could please elaborate on that point. Because I think it's a stretch to say that I am somehow inhibiting art because I choose not to go see The Pianist, or get annoyed when Mike Tyson pops up on a sitcom I like.\n\nI'm not quite sure what your issue is with me making a subjective judgment about what type of art I choose to support. Or how my view is arrogant? I am a consumer. The people making HIMYM are selling a product. I could base my decision to not like it on anything and still be valid as it is subjective. I don't think my ideals should dictate art. I think my dollars should dictate product - that's pretty much a universally agreed upon tenant of capitalism.  \n\nAnd in this case, I posit that Mike Tyson the rapist, playing Mike Tyson the lovable softie, is not entertaining, as I look at him and just see the bad. If you have no issue with that, then good for you. \n\n Well, I never took quite so strong a stance as you state. You use CANNOT and MUST.

Right now I have a ton of screenshots but I'm not positive which coordinates with which episode. I'm working on it though! the changes in decor and whatnot are probably from episodes in season 1 and earl 2, past then, you wont find a change, simply because it is a million times easier for there not to be a change. \n\nif they are recycling footage, it becomes very hard for them to edit something in or out, its is just easier for them to leave it.\n\n\nthe main point of the show, is that we are viewing and listening to a very in depth version, and Ted is probably telling his kids about 2-3 minutes of info for every episode, aso the kids are getting a story all in one night, whilst we are getting it across 8 years. since this program is good with continuity, they wont be changing/editing anything in the room once they begin recycling footage, since people like you will begin to ask questions like where did it suddenly come from and stuff.\n\nseriously, once you get your information from the first two seasons, stop looking through the episodes.  I understand your point, but I'm saying that I've seen changes from season to season. For example, the scenes with the kids in season 6 are not exactly the same as the scenes from season 8. \n\nBackground items have already been confirmed as important - the little yellow bus, for example, and the piece of artwork seen in both Ted's future house and Stella's current house. \n\nThe changes could be completely random, with the set director moving and replacing things in between shots of the kids, and then dispersing them through the seasons, but there are absolutely changes past season 2. there could very well be a change from one scene in se6 and se8, but both of those scenes would have already appeared in season 1 and 2. no new footage of the kids has been filmed since season 2, and it is unlikely they have unseen footage (except for the mother reaction) or they wouldve already used it. im not saying there wont be changes, im saying that after season 2, you would have already seen any possible changes that werent edited in there could very well be a change from one scene in se6 and se8, but both of those scenes would have already appeared in season 1 and 2. no new footage of the kids has been filmed since season 2, and it is unlikely they have unseen footage (except for the mother reaction) or they wouldve already used it. im not saying there wont be changes, im saying that after season 2, you would have already seen any possible changes that werent edited in  The only time i recall seeing a change is from the pilot to the actual episodes.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/18ef2h/does_anyone_have_a_list_of_all_the_episodes_the/", "id": 197, "title": "Does anyone have a list of all the episodes the kids appear in?"}, {"snippet": "   I watched until they started fielding audience questions.\n\nThese videos were super rad.

I definitely agree that life is more about the journey, but HIMYM is starting to push it. To me, season 7 was frustrating. In the beginning of it, we see Barney getting married. Then he goes through this whole thing with Quinn and they end the season by showing that he actually gets married to Robin (something I thought was inevitable after their episode together early on in the series).  \nI completely understand that the show is about how these relationships evolve, but having the entire season be about barney and Quinn and then to throw it out in the last minute feels like a waste. Like, a lot of that could be spent on Barney and Robin, or maybe some more info about the mother.  \nIdk, just my two cents, I guess. The pacing at the end of Barney's and Quinn's relationship was quite unfitting, though the relationship itself was quite important for Barney's character development. After he was ready to settle down he realized he needed someone he could trust in, which led him to Robin. Sure, you could have just put them together otherwise, but I liked it that way. would you rather them have introduced her after season 1? I'd rather they made fewer seasons with less filler.

Although one could make the argument that it didn't really advance the plot because we knew that it was going to happen.  Or like when Barney met his dad Ohhhhh... I thought something big had been announced in yesterdays episode. Sort of. We know that there will be no girls (probably) between the crazy one and the mother.

I'm not so sure they'd make such a big continuity mistake---especially while Barney and Robin's engagement/wedding is so salient right now. I think HIMYM are a bit rubbish with continuity.  Sometimes they go really out of their way to make sure something is perfect, sometimes they totally miss stuff out. Do you have any examples?

I can't remember exactly, but in early episodes Robin says she never took part in any team sports, I think she said she played tennis or do bring similar. \nThen later she's in the hockey team, kisses a boy and her dad sees.  Yes--that's one.  I think that's relatively minor, though.  Definitely nowhere near the scope of forgetting that Robin's married.\n\nA bigger one is the timeline with Lily returning from SF and Barney setting up Marshall with girls and stealing them from him.  That's the only major continuity error I know of.\n\nOther than the hockey error, I can't think of any others---which is certainly far fewer continuity errors than most sitcoms. &gt; A bigger one is the timeline with Lily returning from SF and Barney setting up Marshall with girls and stealing them from him. That's the only major continuity error I know of.\n\nWait, where is the continuity error here? The error is that in E01, Lily returns from SF to NY.  Then in a later episode, E02 IIRC, Barney starts trying to set Marshall up with other women (so that he will get over Lily), but he ends up stealing all of the women from him.\n\nLater in S2, it's revealed that Barney was the one who flew to SF, convinced Lily to come home, and bought her a ticket.  In that flashback, he says to her something to the effect of, \"And come home soon, because I can't keep stealing women from Marshall forever.\"\n\nI consider this the biggest continuity error because it gets the events out of order (Lily came back BEFORE Barney started setting Marshall up on dates) and it gets the character's motives wrong (Barney wasn't stealing women from Marshall to keep him for Lily---Barney was the one who actually started pushing Marshall to date, and then stole the women because, well, he's Barney). The motive is not an issue. Barney wasn't pushing Marshall to date other women because he wanted Marshall to date other women; he was pushing that so that Marshall would stop being mopey-loser-Marshall and start being able-to-pick-up-a-girl Marshall - in other words, a version of Marshall that would be able to win Lily back.\n\nOf all the things Barney's done, stealing women from his bros is something he just doesn't do, outside of this Marshall thing. (I don't think.) It's blatantly clear that he was doing it to stop Marshall, not merely to get laid himself. \n\nThe timing issue...

Do you have any examples? also, early on in the show maybe season 1 or 2 Marshall says something like he's never been in a fight before and is portrayed as some sort of sissy\n\nand then later in the show we see he held fight clubs with his brothers and beat up doug. minor, but the errors are all over the place. One that's always really bothered me is that in one of the earlier seasons, Barney is TERRIFIED of driving, cars and everything to do with them. A few seasons later he's driving and it's never referenced that he used to have this irrational phobia.  The scenes where he didn't know how to drive were flash backs. And the scenes where he is driving are a couple of seasons later. Chances are that he learned to drive in that time frame - maybe Ted made a big deal about it and made sure to teach him when he found out.  also, early on in the show maybe season 1 or 2 Marshall says something like he's never been in a fight before and is portrayed as some sort of sissy\n\nand then later in the show we see he held fight clubs with his brothers and beat up doug. minor, but the errors are all over the place. He just doesn't count fights with his brothers as real fights. There is a difference between wrestling with your brothers and getting into a fight in a bar.  Except we saw that this is definitely not the case for Marshall and his brothers. They were not just wrestling like brothers normally do. Their fights were really damn violent.  There's still a difference between fighting with your friends/siblings and getting into fights in a freaking bar. I got into a fight back in middle school, but I would still say I've never gotten into a \"real\" fight before. In Marshall's case there would be real repercussions for getting into a fight at MacLaren's but that's not the case when he was fighting with his brothers, no matter how \"violent\" they were. Except we saw that this is definitely not the case for Marshall and his brothers. They were not just wrestling like brothers normally do. Their fights were really damn violent.  Do you have any examples? Ted says \"Vomit free since '93!\"\n\nThen in the episode where they made a drinking game about Robin saying But um: \"Then i guess it's not a very good drinking which would mean last night when barney and I played it I didn't get super wasted and throw up all over myself.

That's not inconsistent. Do you have any examples? HIMYM is typically great with continuity.  I'm not so sure they'd make such a big continuity mistake---especially while Barney and Robin's engagement/wedding is so salient right now. HIMYM aren't that great with continuity actually. They got better at towards the end when the finally figured out their end game, but there are plenty of mistakes. Do you have any examples?  The only real severe continuity error I'm aware of is the season 2 timeline surrounding Lily coming home and Barney trying to set Marshall up with women. Marshall has the no food/drink in the Fierro rule, yet in the Tantrum episode, they're shown drinking it in the Fierro.\n\n*Barney is shown being unable to drive, then later an episode features him trying to get out of speeding tickets.\n\nOne episode states that Marshall and Lilly shared a toothbrush, but there are episodes where they're brushing simultaneously.\n\nThese are just a couple off the top of my head, but there are many more throughout the series. I mean, most are fairly minor nitpicks, but it's still annoying, because it's a hallmark of lazy TV writing - create some trope/idea/joke for one episode, and then forget it.\n\n*The Barney driving one has been discussed to death, with many people arguing that he could have learned to drive in that time, which I suppose is plausible, but I still think it counts.\n\n I think it's just an oversight on the show and Cobie's part.

I never bothered with one because I can't wear it while at work and I;m too great at losing things to have one that I take off. Also I got dirty looks from clerks at jewelry stores when I told them i'm a size U, and was then given that condescending 'we don't have anything in *your* size\" even though I know they do because my partner is also a U and that's where we bought his ring. &gt;Also I got dirty looks from clerks at jewelry stores when I told them i'm a size U, and was then given that condescending 'we don't have anything in your size\" even though I know they do because my partner is also a U and that's where we bought his ring.\n\nI have no idea what a ring size of U is. We use numbers in the US. Can you explain? I'm curious what that translates to and why the clerks would give you dirty looks for having that ring size. It's a large men's size, very, very few women have that ring size and there is  stigma attached with anything over an 'R' because you are into the bigger men's sizes, a lot of people think you are trans or buying rings for a gay wedding a lot of high-class jewelry shops are very conservative and a bit prejudice so they are not quick to sell rings if they suspect that.  How many years ahead was this? This might lend some weight to the Barney's dead in the future theory. This was during the 'twelve years later...' scene.  I can't say I'm familiar with that theory though. Basically, people are theorizing that Barney is dead in the future, and that he's so extravagant in the show because Ted is idealizing him. Him dying sometime before 12 years into the future could cause Robin to stop wearing her ring. Well... Now I'm sad. :( Don't worry he's not dead its just a crazy theory. I read the theory. It sort of makes sense. :(\n\nHis last cigarette was 2017, after all. Why would they choose 4 years later? :(((((((\n\nI need to stop reading sad theories. There are some references by future Ted that clearly indicate that he isn't dead like In season 7 Episode10 Tick Tick Tick *Future Ted* say \n\n\n*To this day Barney and Robin swear this is the song they danced to that night*\n\n\nTo me this means he's still alive in 2030 atleast. \n\nEDIT: Ok found another one\n\nSeason 5 Robots Vs. Wrestlers: *\"But every year, we [the gang] still get together for Robots vs. Wrestlers.\",*\n\nSeason 6,\u00a0Subway Wars: *\"To this day, your Uncle Barney won't admit it ...* This is nice. I certainly don't want him to be dead ... but we all need to understand that when the show ends, there will be inconsistencies in the timeline. There already are such inconsistencies. For example, in season 1, it's stated that Marshall has never been in a fight (in an early episode), but then we learn in season 3 that Marshall is an expert fighter from years of fighting with his brothers. For that particular example it could just mean that he doesn't fights with his brothers as legitimate fights. There is a difference between wrestling ~~either~~ older siblings and getting into a fight in a bar.  There are some references by future Ted that clearly indicate that he isn't dead like In season 7 Episode10 Tick Tick Tick *Future Ted* say \n\n\n*To this day Barney and Robin swear this is the song they danced to that night*\n\n\nTo me this means he's still alive in 2030 atleast. \n\nEDIT: Ok found another one\n\nSeason 5 Robots Vs.

I read the theory. It sort of makes sense. :(\n\nHis last cigarette was 2017, after all. Why would they choose 4 years later? :(((((((\n\nI need to stop reading sad theories. In The Exploding Meatball Sub (Season 6 Episode 20, originally aired April 11, 2011) there is a fast forward at the end to \"Ten Years Later...\" in which Barney tricks Marshall into eating a meatball sub... that explodes.\n\nThat means, at the earliest, Barney can die in 2021.  So last cigarette in 2017 doesn't make much sense for that theory. He stops smoking because he develops lung cancer. He stops smoking because he develops lung cancer. He says he's perfectly healthy, so the cigarette has nothing to do with it.  Well... Now I'm sad. :( Exploding Meatball Sub disproves that theory Basically, people are theorizing that Barney is dead in the future, and that he's so extravagant in the show because Ted is idealizing him. Him dying sometime before 12 years into the future could cause Robin to stop wearing her ring. How many years ahead was this? This might lend some weight to the Barney's dead in the future theory. My grandfather died about 20 years ago, and my grandmother still wears her wedding ring.\n\nIt's more likely that the wedding doesn't go through, or Barney and Robin divorce. We already know the wedding goes through. For one, Thomas &amp; Bays have said it does. For another, we saw Robin happily dancing with her father at the reception.  But doesn't Ted seem to be sad/remembering something sad when he sits at the train station after the wedding?   what is the point of wearing the the ring when they clearly want hands not to be shown.Totally agree its an oversight on Cobie's part in this scene. What's the point of hiding the hands if there's nothing to hide? The writers probably want the speculation. You know them. They love teasing us above all things. I can agree about the speculation, I just think that if they were to go that far I think they'd be careful to have her wear/not wear the ring in that scene. Even if she wore the ring we were still not supposed to see the hand it was an clear over sight.\nRing was not relevant in this scene hiding the hand was to generate the speculation on their *will they won't they* thing as mentioned above.   Maybe Robin's like my mom and just never wears her wedding ring.  I only know my mom had a wedding ring because she showed us, and it was gorgeous, and it's opal which is my birthstone by coincidence which means it's going to be my ring one day.  Mom just never liked wearing jewelry that often.\n\nEither that, or Barney's dead. Robin doesn't wear a ring because she likes getting free stuff. Robin doesn't wear a ring because she likes getting free stuff. That was her story line for an entire episode, wasn't it? Robin doesn't wear a ring because she likes getting free stuff.    I maintain, Ted recounts Barney to the kids as if they've never met him.. Likely because he is dead in the future.  We've never seen him in a flash forward I thought this was disproven by the exploding meatball sub future bit. how far ahead was this, i thought it wasn't very far down the line.  I may be remembering incorrectly. the episode aired in april 2011 and the deathbed scene is apparently \"10 years later\" so he's still alive and well in 2021. If I remember correctly Ted's oldest is definitely born by 2015 going by the starwars every 3 years episode. So his daughter would be at least 6 and his son would already be born with Barney still quite alive.  It could simply mean they get divorced not that Barney is dead as many of you are proclaiming. I really hope Barney doesn't die in the future.    Guys, Barney's dead and she just got over it and she took off the ring...  Why is everyone so sure they marry? At the beginning of this season 'after' the wedding, Ted looks all sad and (I'm not sure) he says it wasn't a great time or he didn't want to talk about it. \n\nAnd let's not forget the \"never invite an ex to your wedding.\" \n\nAlthough I do want for them to marry and get it over. 1.

Jesus, it seems like Robin and Lily can't do their drinking meet-ups often enough. If you've hung around aging women who were best friends when they were younger but have grown into their own lives separate of their old friends as long as I have, you realize that the time jumps were appropriate.  Then them constantly saying how they should do this more often was just icing on the cake.  Hey color theorists, she's wearing purple  Why does Barney not get to keep the Boba Fett suit when he already has the stormtrooper? Maybe Robin and him made a compromise and he got to keep the stormtrooper. Why would you ever choose a Stormtrooper over Boba Fett? Didn't barney have sex with someone when they were wearing the stormtrooper suit? Maybe he got a fetish for it.  Why would you ever choose a Stormtrooper over Boba Fett?  I can't help thinking that this episode would be a lot better if the writers could have found a more creative way to get her into the apartment. Rather than Ted saying, \"Don't let her in.\" And Barney and Marshall doing it anyway. I would've liked it if the second he closes the door and turns around she is in the living room. I would've liked it if the second he closes the door and turns around she is in the living room. How about:\n\nHe leaves after warning them, and when the door is knocked on (when marshall thinks its ted forgetting his keys) ted walks in, and grabs his keys from the table. He turns to leave and bam, there she is.  Anyone notice how everyone at the game was wearing white/grey/black except for Jeanette who was wearing Orange? Doubt it's a coincidence that Orange comes directly before Yellow in the rainbow. I also noticed that the nightgown she was wearing toward the end was purple, and that Robin's shirt in one of the flash-forwards was also purple. There was also a whole lot of red in Ted's apartment. Anyone notice how everyone at the game was wearing white/grey/black except for Jeanette who was wearing Orange? Doubt it's a coincidence that Orange comes directly before Yellow in the rainbow. I noticed this in another episode the other day\u2026 when they're boogie boarding outside of the bar, *everyone* is wearing dark colors except Robin, who is wearing bright yellow.  isn't it weird for Barney to be hanging out in his ex fiances old apartment?

Lily and Robin age so well It was like, the makeup department wasn't even trying I like to think that immortality will be invented in a few years. Lily and Robin age so well  Thank you officer Jeanette! [the resemblence is uncanny](http://imgur.com/bWu2g0t)   \"i could just eat you up\" heh \"i could just eat you up\" heh   I really want Barney to show the hot/crazy scale.   First flashforward with Robin?\n\nEdit: Pretty sure I saw a ring on her finger. This confirms any doubt of the marraige   What was the point of the Robin/Marvin storyline if Robin doesn't tell Barney she's infertile? adoption or kidnapping is still a possibility. robin's never been a fan of kids, she always avoided holding them (i forget which episode, but there was one when ted and robin were dating).\n\nI think the writers are showing that even though she can't have kids she's getting over her \"fear\" of them, possibly opening the door for adoption or something like that. Or they're just showing a development that they've already laid out several seasons ago, when Robin dated that guy with a kid. At the end future Ted says something about how she got over that and went on to star in his kids' crayon portraits. adoption or kidnapping is still a possibility.

If you're unfamiliar with Bump Girl, she was the red herring in the episode No Tomorrow in which Ted claims that the mother was at that St. Patrick's Day party.  The fan theory about Bump Girl is essentially that Ted only met 2 girls at that party, one of whom he shared drinks with, the other of whom he bumped into, and so therefore she might possibly be Bump Girl.\n\nThen if we jump to the episode Band or DJ?, we learn that Ted's ex-girlfriend Cindy's former room mate (AKA the person who is definitely the mother) is in a band that does weddings, which is of course the band that performs at Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\nMy hypothesis is this: what if Bump Girl is in the band along with the mother?  If there are multiple women in the band, why couldn't one of them be Bump Girl?  What if Bump Girl, the mother, and Cindy are all friends (and hell, maybe even Stella is one of their friends too which would explain how she was at that bar on St. Patrick's Day as well)?  Further, what if the producers of the show placed the footage of Bump Girl into tonight's episode specifically to give us 1 last red herring in this season's finale?  Bump Girl could be a girl in the band that Ted meets at the wedding (though he has as almost no memory of meeting her prior on St. Patrick's Day) and he could meet her minutes before he meets the mother.  I'm not saying he would date Bump Girl or anything because we know that's not possible because of his explanation tonight that Jeanette was his last girlfriend before he's ready to settle down.\n\nI would be extremely happy if this season ends with Bump Girl as the one that Ted is supposedly looking at only to have her be revealed to be an impossible option for the mother.  Then Ted looks over at the bass player and they echo the same ending sequence from Band or DJ? before rolling the credits.  This would indicate that the very beginning of next season will reveal who the mother is while leaving us desperately wondering who she is all summer.

Damn, I just reviewed the tape and you're right.  I was mistaken about their similarly strange patterned shirts.  Still, despite not being included in that montage, the theory could still work.

Who the fuck is Vicky? Ted met her in the elevator and pulled off the naked men. While she's a horrible bitch in the show, i still think she's damn hot.  FYI she's naked in Dexter.\n\nAlso, Holly is supposed to be spelled \"Holli\", with an \"I\", remember? Holli with \"I\" is on the list, as well as Holly with \"Y\" (she was one of the three online-dating-girls where Ted visualizes Robin). Don't forget Yobin. I don't even know half of these and I rewatched the entire show 2 months ago. Should I be worried?  He didn't date a lot of them... So why are they there? ;b No idea. Off the top of my head he never date Honey, Henrietta or Jen,  Or Maggie. No idea. Off the top of my head he never date Honey, Henrietta or Jen,   After seeing this... I'm not even mad, I'm impressed. I don't care if I even meet the Mother anymore. The show should be called \"The many adventures of Ted the pimp, and his wacky sidekicks.\" After seeing this...

I'm fairly sure Marshal is at the high quality low quantity end while Barney is the opposite. Ted is basically Goldilocks and keeps going between the two extremes.  Maggie so doesn't count. I was going to say, I thought he never dated her? He tried, but he never got to ask her out.  Honey shouldn't count either.  Honey shouldn't count either.  Neither should Henrietta. Or Robyn Well at least he went on a date with Robyn so ill allow it Well at least he went on a date with Robyn so ill allow it Maggie so doesn't count. Tiffany shouldn't either, right? He wasn't really dating her. He was just on her leash, unless I'm confused. Maggie so doesn't count. Maggie so doesn't count.  I miss Victoria... I miss Season 1 Victoria, not so much Season 8 Victoria. This is very true. I wish they'd have made their breakup a little more heartbreaking. She deserved it IMO This is very true. I wish they'd have made their breakup a little more heartbreaking. She deserved it IMO  Poor Blahblah and Unnamed What episode is Unnamed from? I remember Blahblah and Honey, but can't think of any other name slips that Ted had. It could be the chick from \"The Sexless Innkeeper\" but she is officially credited as Maiden and is a blond on imdb.  Yes, it is the chick from \"The Sexless Innkeeper\", her name wasn't mentioned on the show.  Ted: How was I supposed to know she was crazy?\n\nEveryone else: Her name was ***Strawberry*** What episode is she from, I can't remember for the life of me.  where is the coat wench from the club in \"Okay, Awesome\" where is the coat wench from the club in \"Okay, Awesome\"  Stella is the hottest IMO! \n\nBut I'm a scrubs boy that's why.  I'm a fan of Zoey.\n\nBut maybe that's because of House.  Stella is the hottest IMO! \n\nBut I'm a scrubs boy that's why.   So many white girls... They make a comment when going through Barney's scrap book of conquests that there's a lack of diversity in the girls he's been with. Didn't Barney have a quest to sleep with one girl from every country? So many white girls... So many white girls... Except we missed one!!!! The really accomplished girl from \"mystery vs history\"... I can't remember her name So many white girls... What is that supposed to mean?  I think blah blah is my favorite. What do you think of that robin?  According to Ted, who said that Jeanette was his last mistake before he met the mother.  Shouldn't Karen actually be first, if we are going in order of Ted's life, and not the show. Shouldn't Karen actually be first, if we are going in order of Ted's life, and not the show. According to Ted, who said that Jeanette was his last mistake before he met the mother.  Last mistake, but maybe not last relationship. But in Ted's eye, they're all mistakes unless he married then, or at least I'd think so.  I don't know that he'd consider Victoria, Robin, Stella, or Zooey a mistake.  He truly loved them, and they had future wife potential, in his mind (even though Robin stated from the beginning that she didn't want to he married).  And certainly he shouldn't consider dating Cindy a mistake because if he hadn't he never would have met the mother. I agree with you. The way the show is written it just seems like every girl is a mistake and he needs to go back to Robin, who he truly loves. He even says in one episode about Stella something along the lines of knowing she loved her ex but trying to ignore it because he wanted a wife. I think the conclusion of the show will be him getting over Robin (who up to this point is still \"the one\") and meeting the mother. Who he will then fall in love and realize that Robin was never truly right for him.  According to Ted, who said that Jeanette was his last mistake before he met the mother.  According to Ted, who said that Jeanette was his last mistake before he met the mother.   He didn't date Henrietta. They were hanging out as friends, but she expected it to be more in the future. He kept her \"on the hook\".\n\nEdit: Didn't Honey go to Barney's place? I guess they were on a date but she went home with Barney.   Where's Rachel Bilson?   Didn't Ted only go on one date with Janet?  A date which ended poorly, too.  Should that really count?   went on a date with = participated in dating = dated went on a date with = participated in dating = dated          Zoey.  I like her.  What's the actress's name?  Zoey.

Yea, that's one of the questions which won't be answered because it has already been by narrator Ted.

They've already put themselves into a corner where they have to reveal the mother either at the end of the season 8 finale or the beginning of season 9, if it opens still on the night of the wedding.  There's no way to fit any significant porton of an episode between the wedding and the meeting at Farhampton, unless done as a present-day flashback where present Ted is telling the gang about meeting her shortly before (as in, the previous night).

It would've been much MUCH better to have it been about a deep-seated character flaw about each other (Ted/Victoria) or their relationship (built on a betrayal). \n\nFrankly, I would've liked to have seen the conflict between Victoria that would be afraid of reality/commitment (See \"Drumroll, Please\" and abandoning her wedding), and Ted similarly afraid of reality, but desperate for commitment (See moving to NJ, staying with Zooey despite potentially giving up his dreams, keeping Victoria from her wedding). \n\nOh well.

Whenever my friends are discussing cheeseburgers, I always interject with \"I had nightmares about that burger!\"   Scumbag Marshall? No such thing. Genius Marshall.   I know this is kind of a copout answer, but isn't kind of the point of that episode that he used finding that burger as kind of an ability to move on to the next phase of his life? Like he had to experience that burger again to get off the couch and put pants on and get a new job?\n\nThat burger was the first thing that he really enjoyed about New York City (which was the first big post-college part of his life) and since he hadn't had it since that day, it was always a part missing.\n\n(Plus, the whole, he probably went to the burger place more often than Ted told his kids about, e.g. like how the group still smoked outside of the smoking episode). Marshall?  You know a lot about these character's depth. Don't know if I caught that when I watched it months back. I thought the burger was a metaphor for something he couldn't find any more because his tastes had changed.  Marshall?  You know a lot about these character's depth. Don't know if I caught that when I watched it months back. I thought the burger was a metaphor for something he couldn't find any more because his tastes had changed.  From the episode:\n\n&gt;It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.\n\n-Marshall\n\nAnd later on:\n\n&gt;And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back.\n\n-Future Ted It's pretty awesome that I heard that in their voices. Of course it wasn't until last year that I realized Future Ted is Bob Saget. Crazy. It's a good thing you learned it before last episode then because you wouldn't have gotten the joke! I actually haven't seen the last episode, but I'll be watching it today. I'll make sure to watch out for the reference. You're going to love it.    I hate when people do this, it happens a lot in /r/HIMYM in particular. Just because something isn't shown on the show doesn't mean it doesn't happen. \n\nWe have to suspend our disbelief and pretend marshall eriksen (and the other characters) is a real person for the show to have any value, first of all. Second, we have to realize that as a real person, he does things we don't see.\n\nDo you see every single thing your best friend does? No? Does this mean you believe they just sit there until you're around again so they can continue with their lives? Of course not. Neither does Marshall.   I always wondered why he didn't just order one burger and test it out before *everyone* ordered burgers...  I can understand actually. A while back, i showed all my closest friends the best place for a burger in the city and we haven't all been back up there together in a long time. Sure one or two of us might go from time time, but we didn't make it the new hangout spot. Yeah, the thing about the best burger joint in town, is that it's normally the most expensive too. The inverse is true for kebab places. The inverse is true for kebab places. I wish we had Kebab places. I don't think I've ever actually *had* a Kebab.          It actually makes sense that he wouldn't go back that often. What happens when you eat a certain food too often, even if you really like it? You get sick of it. The answer is simply that Marshall did not want to lose affection for his favorite burger by eating there too often.   Well they technically didn't even eat there...the place was closed and replaced with a GNB cash machine. Soooo there's no where to eat the \"right\" burger. That's why they where never there again But they did get the right burger at the end of the episode... The restaurant had just moved.        Or maybe they just don't show him going to lunch, because that would be fucking retarded.

Lol I've noticed that now people aren't only getting confused by the show but also everything the writers have said. I always have to do tons of research when I blog about HIMYM because I rely on quotes from the writers to confirm and deny so much stuff! I would agree with that.\n\nWhat is your blog? Posted this in the wrong place before - my log is corinawrites.com. I do a bunch of HIMYM sleuthing posts :) damn, that is some impressive research on the show.  The mother is Dave Coulier Cut it out!  I don't know if this helps, but I read recently that when the mother is cast, there will be absolutely no casting announcements of any sort so we do not know what she looks like.  Do you have screen caps of this extra?     I had never heard one way or the other, but I always just kind of assumed that the mother has been showing up as an extra throughout the series.  that would really fit the style of the show.  Perhaps they have always had the mother narrowed down to 2 or 3 women, and they've each been showing up as extras.  That way, they could still say that she hasn't been cast yet, right?  I would look for someone more subtle than the extra that corinawrites noticed.  She sounds like the least likely contender if my theory pans out.  I would watch for someone sitting on the other side of the bar, and almost impossible to notice if you aren't looking for her.  How cool would it be if we finally see the mother, and then it goes to a montage of footage of her in various episodes.  I think that would tie in with the other times he has crossed paths with her - we know they've been living in the same area.  I think we will find out that when he turned and said excuse me to Bump Girl, he just missed seeing the mother walk by.    My best guess on the mom is the chick that comes out in the St. pattys Episode where Ted bumps into her while walking to the bar. I say this because he was talking about how the kids mom was there that same time.  That kind of makes sense. Go one step further and WHY include her bumping into Ted, when we don't ever see her again? I don't think she is the mother though. They put a lady bumping into Ted there to fuck with the viewers, who specifically know to \"look out\" for the mother in this scene.  She may or may not be the mother and in the end it doesn't matter.  It was a fun little thing to do to make the viewers speculate/get excited.  It is inherently wrong to assume the woman was of any actual importance to the story.  Am I the only one who doesn't even care about who the mother is anymore? It may mostly be because I hate Ted and don't want him to have happiness Ted has really been pissing me off the past few seasons. I guess I feel like he isn't trying to move on or really find his destiny, he's just kinda stuck in the past or moping around all the time. I still think he's funny but I find this current version of Ted much less appealing than, say, No Tomorrow's Ted. He's the worst. He always does annoying ass things and then makes people feel bad for getting mad. Like when he took over with Marvin and became totally creepy and was taking him to do all that stuff without telling Marshall and Lilly, that's pretty fucking annoying. Then they get mad at him and he's like \"oh but I thought I'd have my own by now, blah blah feel bad for me\"  It is seriously annoying. I totally get where he's coming from - I'm single &amp; would love to settle down but haven't found the right guy. My BFF is happily married, owns a house, and has a beautiful family. But I don't begrudge her happiness or become depressed by it. If anything her happily ever after gives me hope that I will find mine. I guess I just don't think it's cool to use your misery as an excuse to make others miserable. That's cause you're not a poop like Ted Well he does have a few years on me so I suppose there's a chance I will descend into bitterness...but I doubt it. Grow up Mosby! Haha for real.

I'd love to see them discover and then recount St. Patrick's Day, the Economics classroom etc. from the two perspectives. They've done similar things in other episodes--like Subway Wars or Brunch where they tell pieces of a story and how they fit together. That wouldn't require having to switch it up and tell from the mother's perspective which would change the entire feel of the show. I think it would help give closure to long time fans and show the development of the mother in certain ways and help to fit the pieces of the puzzle together so we can see how Ted and the mother \"fit\" as well. Plus, I think it could keep people interested if the writers do it well, discovering little easter eggs from previous seasons that might not have been obvious before.

Don't you feel silly.  I stand by what I said!  That's your opinion, man. It's fine to have it, but I feel bad for you. Rush is amazing. I have my reasons. I could have my own tv show called \"Why I hate rush\". It'd start out \"kids, in 2002, I was in college a stranger smacked me on the ass.\" It would end \"in my head, the whole bowling alley got to their feet and cheered. In reality, my friends high-fived me and I began to enjoy my 21st birthday. And that, kids, is why I fucking hate Rush.\" Can I ask what your reasons are just want to understand, is it his voice, cause you can't deny that the are great musicians.   His voice is upsetting to me. I do not like it. I'd be merely apathetic about Rush if it weren't for a young man I dated whose parents were so obsessed with Rush that they named their young son Geddy. This young chap had two ways to take being saddled with that particular name: he could say \"yes, I like Rush. They are fine musicians\" and develop other interests and a decent personality, or he could become as obsessed with Rush as his parents and be a horrible, manipulative, lying, immature little shit. Regrettably, he went with the latter. Naturally, when he walked up to me, smacked me on the ass and said, \"Hey, babe. Is this the smmmmokin' section?\" while wiggling his eyebrows, I was smitten. However, despite such charming beginnings, our relationship was not the divine thing of Rumi poetry. \n\nHe cheated on me, came back with ridiculously over-the-top *I've been cheating on you* signs (claw marks on back, bite marks on neck) and when I would start to break up with him, he would threaten to commit suicide or staunchly deny that anything untoward had actually happened and it was a strange set of circumstances that were really funny when you think about it, and furthermore, why didn't I trust him? \n\nHe convinced his friends to try to seduce me to make him feel like less of an asshole. He got busted on marijuana possession charges and guilted me into selling my blood (well, plasma) in order to help him pay his legal fees. He then took the blood money and spent it on fast food. \n\nOnce, when I tried to break up with him for cheating on me, he promised to take me out to a nice date that would not be interrupted by any of his friends trying to fuck me or any of his friends trying to fuck him. We went to a sushi restaurant where he realized he didn't have enough money for both of us, so he asked me to pay for myself and leave the tip (which I had no problem doing, since I was used to having to pay for both of us, anyways.) We then went to the movies. While standing in line for tickets, he realized he didn't have enough money for even his own ticket and asked for me to pay for both tickets. Once again, I didn't mind paying for him, as I always had to pay for him everywhere else, so I was more or less used to it. As we approached the box office to purchase the tickets, he was getting more and more nervous. Finally, he admitted that he didn't want the box office cashier to think he was so cheap that his girlfriend had to pay for him at the movies, so he requested that he be allowed to hold the money and pay. I agreed to this rather odd request. He kept the change (over $5.) \n\nHe would sexually harass my gay friend, but then when my gay friend would say \"Hey, man. That's not alright. I'm not into you and your girlfriend is LITERALLY RIGHT THERE!\" He would deny that he was actually flirting with him, and then try to kiss him. He would also send lewd messages to the friend. \n\nI am usually a very good-natured person who gets along with most people. It is rare, therefore, when there is someone I actively dislike. There was one particular girl on campus I disliked. She was very unstable, and thought it was appropriate to tell me how much she wanted to be with my boyfriend and how much she didn't like me. Naturally, young Geddy not only cheated on me with her repeatedly, he attempted to make us be friends, presumably so he could win the championship belt. He then went out of his way to find the one person I did not get along with in high school. He  fucked her, too. \n\nHe got evicted from his shitty apartment, so I let him stay in my dorm room with me for a few weeks while he looked for a new place to live for free. I would regularly come back from classes to find him bundled up in one of my sweaters, masturbating furiously to internet pornography. The sweaters, he explained, were softer than his own clothes. That was the only explanation that was forthcoming about his behavior. Once he found a new place to live for free, he fucked at least one of the people there who had scabies, and transmitted it to me. \n\nI have so many more anecdotes about how awful this young man was. However, throughout the entire relationship, he remained true to his one and only love: Rush. He would sing Rush songs all the time. He would listen to Rush constantly. If someone was talking about music, he had to bring Rush up. I heard more Rush during the year or two that we dated than I had in my entire life leading up to that point or since then. \n\nI had a nervous break down, dropped out of college, moved back in with my family, and slowly began successfully distancing myself from the young man. On my 21st birthday, my friends and I went bowling. I hadn't spoken to Geddy in almost a week and I was starting to feel slightly less heavy with dread. Then he called. He wanted to talk. The bowling alley was loud, all of my friends were there, and he kept trying to tell me a story about why McDonalds wouldn't hire him back, or why he got fired from KMart or something. Finally, I asked what he wanted. He said \"Well, I just wanted to call my WholesaleBees on her birthday and talk to her.\" I said, and keep in mind it was a very loud evening at the bowling alley, so I said it rather loudly and forcefully to be heard over the din and through the cheap cellphones that were available in 2004, \"Let's get one thing straight: I am not **your** WholesaleBees. Thank you for the birthday wishes. Please don't ever call me again.\" I hung up the phone. In my head, the whole bowling alley got to their feet and cheered. In reality, my friends high-fived me and I began to enjoy my 21st birthday party. And that, kids, is why I fucking hate Rush.  I think you hate that guy more than you hate Rush, Rush would never be caught dead around something like that. I doubt you ever gave Rush a chance, I don't blame you with that stigma attached. Also since you are a girl it makes more sense, girls don't really like Rush(not sexist, just a joke that's brought up around the fans and band) I'm positive I hate that guy more than Rush. I never really thought about Rush one way or the other before him, and now every Rush song I've ever heard, and the lead singer's voice and image are permanently associated with one of the worst times of my life. But that is the real story of why I fucking hate Rush. I figured this was a safe place for it way down here in the threads of a buried comment.

I think Robin was the 'almost but not quite what you want' instead of Ted's 'Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz' (Lifelong treasure destiny) its important to highlight just how difficult of a struggle that is, how easy it is to believe so much that the thing thats not quite what you want is a temptation. \n\nTL;DR It's necessary to have this struggle between the two to make the finding out who the mother actually is to be that much more prominent.

As of \"Slap Bet\" she was a generic, Tiffany/Debbie Gibson '80s bubblegum pop (except in the '90s because, as we all know, the '80s didn't come to Canada until 1993) one-hit wonder. As of \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" the analogy changed to pretty much any one-hit wonder that attempts to further her career by greatly changing the style of her followup effort. Only as of \"Glitter\"'s variety show did the Alanis parallel become possible, but certainly not definitive; \"P.S. I Love You\" could just as easily have made her a Canadian version of Christina/Britney/Justin, as ThisDerpForSale mentions. Not just tonight - it was a pretty clear homage from the start.

Did you even watch the \"Possimpibile\" episode?\n  I had a very similar thought. Mine is probably easier explained than yours, but I digress.\n\nWhen Robin started her job at WWN, she was having the issue of Sandy Rivers exploiting her and found \"everything\", including even news tapes Barney hadn't seen.

Mighty Mouse, and that came out when I was a kid, so clearly she never *stopped* watching cartoons.  Shame made my mother a liar, and I decided to never fall for that trap. I'm assuming that's where the username comes from? Looks like a cool show, I can't say I remember it, but it looks interesting.\n\n\nYou were smarter than I was, so were my siblings. Is your mother still like that, not willing to admit her love of cartoons?\n\n\n\nI can't recall if my mother or father had any thoughts about cartoons.

She and I were at the mall one day, and we stopped into one of the boutique stores, and it had Hello Kitty merchandise.  My mother, remembering my Hello Kitty diary and slap bracelet I had when I was like, 7, turned to me and said, \"It looks like someone's generation forgot to grow up.\"\n\nI replied with, \"Here I come to save the daaaaayyy!\" and she dropped it.  But at least she very openly still watches Mighty Mouse.  She also watches old school Casper, Looney Tunes, and she'll still catch Scooby Doo now and again. He was also on Coach. It's how I knew him.  \"M-O-O-N that spells moon\" will always be the role I remember him for.  Tom Cullen was my favorite character in the whole book.

Not sure what you mean.  Is the suspense really what makes HIMYM successful? It's a huge part of the draw. Just look through the history here and see how frustrated every one gets when we go another season without knowing who the Mother is, or when the writers keep going back to the damn Robin/Ted well instead of moving forward.\n\nWith the Mother, we already know she ends up with Ted, so whatever relationships we see will automatically comes with an expiration date. \n\nIt's also difficult to imagine they make up for it with strong characters that can match the gang. TV sequel/prequel history is rife with bad spinoffs of sitcoms (Joey, After M*A*S*H,) etc. And the Mother is an enigma, so having to fill in everything about her character, and no matter what they put out, it's not going to match the imagination of the millions of fans.  To me, and those I watch with after discussing this for a bit, we feel that we have to be reminded about the Mother more than worrying who it is.\n\nMy wife suggested that this could be because we are not watching as it goes but wait for full seasons and watch it alternately with other shows season by season.  This might be the case.\n\nHowever, I feel, that the appeal of this show is that its a journey vs destination situation.  I would think that amung those who want to know who the Mother is are probably outnumbered by those who don't want the show to end.  \n\nPlus HIMYF could start in parallel to resolutions HIMYM.  With the exception of soap operas, sci-fi shows have many strong cases where the show/spin-offs have results already known to the audience and it does little to distract from the appeal.  ( ST:DPS vs ST:Voyager, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica vs Caprica, etc. )\n\nBest friend, who I am trying to get to stop in to share explanation better than I can, suggested that the show reminds her of the Lovecraftian-Cthulhu'esk RPG game session we ran for a few months without all the crazy monsters, insanity, and a lot less 1900s.  Many different ways to see take this but the area she talked about was about the characters and the complex interactions.  Think of all the characters/guests that could have easy tie in cross over or even permanent roles in spin-off.  (We had a number of small sessions, that, due to life, had me and smaller subset of the players in the game as few as one.  This made the interest/care of players for different NPCs very greatly for full group sessions.)", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/17tclw/i_have_a_theory_on_what_comes_next/", "id": 395, "title": "I have a theory on what comes next..."}, {"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJgD4fqJyZ8", "id": 396, "title": "Everything is a remix.

Definitely Victoria for me. If the show had of ended after season 1 I would have been happy with her being the mother. I'm not a massive fan of the \"psycho\" Victoria that we seen last season though. Definitely Victoria for me.

Definitely Victoria for me. If the show had of ended after season 1 I would have been happy with her being the mother. I'm not a massive fan of the \"psycho\" Victoria that we seen last season though. Could not agree more with this. Loved Victoria, she was hot, cute, and just had that personality that I think everyone loved. \n\nUnfortunately, when she came back onto the show, a lot of her fun was gone and now I don't much care for her, but man...season 1 she was the greatest and I wanted her to be the mom.  Mary the Paralegal, if only for a night...\n\nMy briefs are tight right now thinking about her.    Since this isn't a \"which girlfriend would you want to be the mom\" post, I honestly have to say that Zoey has been my favorite. Yeah she was strong willed and a bit crazy but she was gorgeous and had a great personality.  Really? I hated her. In my opinion she had some really messed up priorities when it came to the Arcadian. She just had a personal attachment to the building because she grew up in it. It's natural to have those feelings. I know, but it wasn't being used anymore and it was significant for Ted's career. I think she should have realized that it's just a building and her boyfriend's career should take priority over that. In one aspect, I agree with you. But if you look at it from her side, you may seem different.\nCan I blow up the family home you grew up in and build a bank in its place since it would make me money? Yeah, I mean, I understand why she would be really sad about it, but to go as far as potentially holding back the career of someone she cares about? It wasn't just about the money, it would have been a good move for Ted's career. I dunno, that seems very messed up to me. Yeah I agree but you can't blame just her for that. She and Ted both chose to never have that conversation about it....maybe if they had discussed the situation more she might have changed her mind.\nBut beyond that, Ted did in the beginning feel that the Arcadian should be saved (as per the recording), so did he honestly change his mind about the building later or did he just decide that it was better for his career?\n\nI look at the Arcadian situation as a metaphor for Ted's love life....he really doesn't know what he wants. Yeah--Ted and Zoey definitely had some communication issues and butted heads way too often. \n\nWell, he did say it should be saved, but Zoey basically manipulated him into feeling so bad for her that he would agree with anything she said. Plus, I think his developing feelings had something to do with it too. So I think he always felt that creating the new GNB headquarters was the best move, and he was just trying to please Zoey.  He did state numerous times that the Lion Head was an architectural landmark. Oh well, either way it worked out as it should.\nI wonder if she'll be making a comeback since the Captain is confirmed to make an appearance. Yeah I agree but you can't blame just her for that. She and Ted both chose to never have that conversation about it....maybe if they had discussed the situation more she might have changed her mind.\nBut beyond that, Ted did in the beginning feel that the Arcadian should be saved (as per the recording), so did he honestly change his mind about the building later or did he just decide that it was better for his career?\n\nI look at the Arcadian situation as a metaphor for Ted's love life....he really doesn't know what he wants. The Arcadian, much like the duck in the \"Rabbit or Duck\" episode, is a symbol of progress.  Zoey's love for the Arcadian is creditable, however she has to realize that the hotel is no longer inhabitable and therefore useless; the opportunity of the new building represents the decision to advance in life and progress into a brighter future, while keeping it will show the inability to let something go.  In a way, it fits in like a small puzzle piece to the puzzle that is \"How I Met Your Mother\". Ted has met and parted with a plethora of women throughout the show, including a handful of significant ones that he had to let go, (as in Robin and Victoria).  The eventual destruction of the Arcadian teaches us that change is inevitable, and can eventually be for the best, because as we know, if it had not been for the new building, Ted would never have met the mother. Since this isn't a \"which girlfriend would you want to be the mom\" post, I honestly have to say that Zoey has been my favorite. Yeah she was strong willed and a bit crazy but she was gorgeous and had a great personality.  She was a horrifically self important cunt! She married for money and whe she got board with that she cheated on her husband with another man. She never trusted Ted, keeping the recording and betraying him the moment he stood up for himself.

I actually feel bad for even having thought of the scenario. But I did think about it last night while watching Netflix reruns. Curious as to your thoughts and ideas...  Just have Bob Saget take over the role, that would be the best they could do in that kind of situation.  I was honestly thinking about this yesterday. I think the best option would be for the writers to make season 9 from the mother's point of view. Then in the finale, she would be at the train station and they could use old sound footage to have Ted say something simple like \"hey\" or \"hello.\" She turns towards him, we see Ted (again from old footage) and then we hear Bob Sagat's voice, \"...and that, kids, is the story of how I met your mother.\"\n\nBut I hope we don't have to worry about it.  Use Jimmy Fallon to play Ted. Use Jimmy Fallon to play Ted.  If something this tragic did happen, I would much rather the whole show be cancelled than see someone else play Ted.   They'd re-cast Ted, like TV shows do when something tragic happens.  Well, that would be immensely unsatisfying as a viewer. I guess there's not really a good option. They did it Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. They just replaced Will's Aunt after 3 seasons. In Spartacus the lead actor passed away and they had to recast the lead. It's not the same, but he brings his own tweaks to the character. \n\nThey really don't have much of an option unless they want to stop the show. But with a show like HIMYM it makes too much money for them to not finish the last season.  I agree that's probably what the writers would do. But replacing Will's Aunt or Daren on Bewitched and replacing Ted on HIMYM are very different. Ted is a main character, not like Will's aunt. I guess the actor would have to be pretty great.\n They did it on Spartacus. It's a guilty pleasure show of mine but Andy Whitfield was perfect for the role. Unfortunately he passed away and they were forced to replace him. They replaced him with Liam McIntyre and although he's not as good as Andy Whitfield, he plays the Spartacus with his own technique and ideas. Had some big shoes to fill and does it pretty successfully. And in my opinion, that role is harder to replace than Ted's from HIMYM.\n\nNot ideal, but they could do it. Also, I would imagine Bob Saget would be a good back-up since he does the voice overs.  Oddly enough, I would vote for Bob Saget to do it. They could go all out and make Vicki (his former Full House love interest- yes I'm embarrassed I know that), the mother. They'd re-cast Ted, like TV shows do when something tragic happens.  Yeah, but shows don't often recast a main character. Especially one so fundamental to the story as Ted is. They do when something tragic happens...which is what the OP asked. Not that often though, usually they write it in e.g. 8 Simple Rules, when John Ritter died, he also died in show.\n\nI suppose they could recast Ted, but I really don't think it would work. I can't think of any shows that have recast the title character and continued to work. Spartacus. Andy Whitfield died (aka Spartacus) and was replaced by Liam McIntyre. \n\nI don't think they could write off Ted dying in the final season if they haven't shot anything and he still hasn't met his wife in the stories he's telling.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/17ptg7/what_if_the_actor_that_plays_ted_died_or_was_for/", "id": 431, "title": "What if the actor that plays Ted died (or was for some other reason I can't think of not available) and couldn't shoot the final HIMYM season and couldn't act in the episodes where Ted finally, FINALLY meets the mother?

Not only do I feel the storyline is fantastic, but the characters as just so diverse and memorable. They're just a weird crowd of people that turn out to be best friends, and it's just really interesting to watch. Each person has that unique quirk about them.  Beyond the fact that I still find it funny and entertaining, it's helped me move on with my life. Long-story short: After one of the worst breakups in my life (one that lasted a strong five years until a whole assortment of bad shit happened all at once) is about the same time (a month later) that I started watching HIMYM on Netflix. I think I cleared two seasons in less than a week, and it's been six months since the breakup. The help progressed in two stages:  The first was the character Barney, and second, naturally, was Ted. \n\nBarney's line, \"Whenever I'm sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.\" That stuck with me harder than I thought any simple mostly-joke could. I started reaching out to old friends and started being more social with people in class and out at bars and clubs downtown. I stopped playing so many video games. I started getting better grades, diving into a new major (psychology). I picked up things that I hadn't done in a while, like kendo and soccer. I became more fashion-conscious, and I started talking to more girls. The confidence shift that I experienced was incredible, and remembering the kind of fucked but awesome advice of Barney helped me find that.\n\nI met two girls over the course of those six months and re-established ties with an old friend from high school - two were one-night stands (but the kind where we keep talking from time to time on Facebook). Don't get me wrong, the sex was awesome, but it felt...lacking. And this is when I was convinced that I'd become more like Barney to avoid the kind of emotional hurt that I felt then.\n\nEnter Ted. Ted's character gave me hope - one of the biggest themes of the show. I was convinced that I'd never love again, blah blah blah. Time heals all wounds and such, but seeing Ted struggle for true love is what, in conjunction with the 'time healing all wounds' stuff, inspired me to start giving it another go, even if I'm still worried about experiencing that kind of heartbreak again.\n\nThe third girl, the old friend from high school, we kind of had drunk sex on new years eve, but when we woke up we didn't regret a damn thing. As of right now, we're not official in the slightest, but we still enjoy each other's company. It's one of those weird things - we talked about it, and we're both worried that if we try something more 'real' we could eventually not even be friends anymore. The way we act, though? You'd think we were together. So even if she isn't the one, she still helps me feel that way, you know? But we've made it clear that if we find someone else to go for it, and that we'd think about becoming official as time went on. It may sound weird, but it makes me happy. And the sex is awesome and more intimate.\n\nThe kind of hurt Marshall felt at the end of season one and the beginning of season two also resonated deep with me when I got to that part. Bloody feels.\n\nAnyway, I know it's just a show, but it (and my close friends, of course) helped me get through the sort of emotions I'd never experienced before - massive, massive heartbreak. Bleh.\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr**: Heart broken after five year relationship, became like Barney, then became more like Ted, happier and more confident than ever thanks in part to this show and its characters. Wow. I am glad that I was not the only person who appreciates HIMYM that it helped me get over my heart-break. Thank you for sharing your story. And.. I've just started a new relationship as well. For me, I'd like to get really serious with him although I cannot get rid of the fear of bad bad feeling when I had to go through the break-up. \nAnd...I am really sorry to my boy friend cause I know that I am kinda bugging him because of my insecurities. So...if you don't me asking, are you experiencing the same thing?  I see myself in Marshall. I keep watching the show because it gives me hope for my future and how a I want my marriage to be (as long as my wife doesn't almost leave me like Lily).\n\nAlso, once I got to about the 3rd season I realized that there was no way out of it except for finding out who the mother is.   To me, it is an acronym of How I met your mother. True story.  To me, it is an acronym of How I met your mother. True story.   I have always loved this show. My ex-girlfriend and I used to watch together. So it kind of helps me remember the good times we had together Wow. So do you miss her, or only the memories? Both, really. But the memories are nice to have and remember  I just thought it was a funny show I caught on reruns (about 4 years back). I caught up quickly and began really liking the characters and their development. I liked that the characters evolve and grow.  At this point, I think that I would enjoy the show so much more if it weren't for the fact that the original intended premise always called for an endgame that nobody expected to be dragged out this long.  Although I'm not happy about the fact that there will be another season and we have to wait until then to meet the mother, I will watch it until the end. I don't watch much television and DVR everything I like, but this is the one show that I still watch as it's airing.  Well, I envy you that you can at least catch them up on TV. I cannot since I am in Korea. ;( We are not allowed to watch HULU here even. UNFAIR!!! That sucks! Can you catch them on Itunes?  I missed an episode once that my DVR didn't record and wound up watching it on Itunes, but I had to pay $1 for it.   Its funny background noise for when im doin homework after class.  I remember watching the very first episode when it was first aired in 2005 and thinking \"This show is gonna be something special.\" And it has been very special and significant in my life. HIMYM means a lot to me because it gives me hope. I love the ideas and theories and ideology that the show covers. To me, the show does a really good job of featuring both realistic things as well as idealistic things. The show taught me you should take the leap, that somehow you will be in the right place in the right time, that sometimes you end up a doppleganger to who you once were, that there are times when you think you are okay in life but you are really crooked, that it's all leading somewhere for us, that it is possible to be on someone's hook and to have someone on your own hook and to let them go, that last words are important, and so many other lessons. Honestly, HIMYM is one of my favorite shows because of the lasting impact it's had on me.   I keep watching and love the show because it is the perfect love story about how even though Ted had so many women he remembers every detail to the T and found his one true love. All the characters are awesome! Love HIMYM  I personally love the show because I really identify with the characters, especially Marshall and Ted. The characters were obviously written to be relatable, but I find myself reminiscing about similar situations or emotional rides they go on in the show that I to have experienced. Then there's the little things, like the love of Star Wars, having a small, but right group of friends, and the pursuit of \"the one\" encompass the life of a college student looking to the future.     I am Ted! Right down to the quirky jokes to being a head over heels romantic. It is nice to sympathize and relate to a character so easily. Also there are morals in the story that have helped me through my high school life. Plus its funny as hell.  I am Ted! Right down to the quirky jokes to being a head over heels romantic.

Do you have red cowboy boots as well? Haha. I wish!!! I would totally pull them off!   Lately, I've been pretty disenchanted with HIMYM.  I started watching in between seasons 2 and 3, and have kept up with it for the last 5-6 years.  Lately, it's just been feeling pretty generally lackluster, and I feel it has jumped the shark.\n\nThen we got to The Robin.  The Robin reminded me, not only why I watched in the first place, but why I continue to watch it today.  It's a comedy that I can relate to.  I've chased the girl I thought was the one, and have been shot down.  I've been the guy who thought I'd be single forever, until one person changed that for me.  I've struggled with the loss of a beloved family member.  I watch it, and I see these deep emotional scenes, and I feel things that I rarely feel in real life.  Then I see scenes like The Robin, and I feel like everything will work out.\n\nSure it's only television, but it just helps me understand, and have a little bit more hope in, this crazy world we're all a part of.

But it would be nice to give some screen time to the relationship as well. I'm sure they will but probably not a whole season. I think they're going to end with Ted's final relationship being perfect. To me, that's how they always describe the mother in comparison to all the other girls he has dated. In past seasons, they spend so much time on a relationship because they take it through all of the stages (first date, happy relationship status, a bit rocky, inevitable breakup). While we always knew how all Ted's past relationships would end (with a breakup), his journey through them is what was important. I think we will get to know the mother but I think they will represent that relationship as idyllic and thus, dedicate less screen time to it than they have done with past relationships.  Maybe once Ted finally meets the mother, there is like a quick montage of their whole life together (but it has to be very short, less than 10 seconds) and they flash through his eyes(like the time he was hit by a cab). Then he finally goes and talks to her. A little something-something to appease the fans? Yes I get that, and they've had 7 wonderful season to show that.

Not in a hollywood movie.  Not in Bohemian Rhapsody.  Not in a sitcom.  \n\nPost-resolution stories are masturbation.  If you're interested pointless, boring, plotless entertainment, read fan-fiction.   Yes, thank you for your condescending reply. However, in the case of HIMYM, I feel it would add more to the show, to not only show the meeting, but the actual development of the relationship. IMHO. Just because you want vicarious gratification doesn't mean it's a good story. It's as if some fans think they're \"owed\" seeing Ted and Mother together after all this time. \n\nI'd prefer a good story. And just because you don't want to see it, doesn't mean your version is better. Last time I checked what makes a story good or bad is a matter of opinion. Check again.  The Godfather is a better movie than Manos: The Hands of Fate.  Period.  There's a reason one scores 100 points more than the other on RottenTomatoes, and it's not because every single critic *randomly happened* to share the same opinion.\n\nThings like character development, and dramatic tension *matter.* I'm not saying those things don't matter, but once again you're proving me right, movies are based off of opinions. There are a ton of classic movies that I like, that other people can't stand. Does that make them wrong? No, because it's their opinion. You're trying to argue with things like story arch, dramatic tension, character development, etc..., but there are a ton of bad movies that also contain these elements. Yes, thank you for your condescending reply. However, in the case of HIMYM, I feel it would add more to the show, to not only show the meeting, but the actual development of the relationship. IMHO. &gt;I feel it would add more to the show\n\nWhy?\n\nI mean, I can understand why you *want* to see it.  At one point in time, I wanted to see a 20 minute lightsaber fight.  Then Star Wars, Episode III came out, and the 20 minute lightsaber fight was the most boring, mindless, indulgent, meaningless thing I'd ever witnessed.  It served no purpose other than the fact that it appealed to people who wanted to see shiny things moving fast.  \n\nHIMYM is about Ted's emotional journey.  It's about his transformation from some naive guy who thinks that a relationship will solve all of his problems into the man who learns to love his own life, and in so doing, finally draws people to him instead of repelling them from him.  Then, at the end of that journey, when he finally learns that he can't get happiness from a relationship, he gets to meet the woman he'll one day marry.  \n\nWhat do you think an extra nine months showing them living happily ever after will add to the story?  WAIT. SO WE WONT FIND OUT THIS SEASON? WAIT. SO WE WONT FIND OUT THIS SEASON? surely he gets to barney and robins wedding by around may, which is when the season will be getting to the end. so by past seasons, the last shot of this season will be the image looking at ted from behind the mother playing the bass at the wedding. I WILL BEAT A NIGGA DOWN IF THAT HAPPENS WAIT. SO WE WONT FIND OUT THIS SEASON? WAIT. SO WE WONT FIND OUT THIS SEASON?  I'm sorry, but it should've ended last season. The writing has been getting worse (in my opinion) and more or less they're just rehashing old storylines at this point. What's more, Ted is going to meet the mother in ~May-June 2014 and then virtually instantly knock her up so they can have their kid by something-2015.\n\nI love(d) this show, but ever since season 8 started, I find myself thinking \"Why am I still watching this?\" every time, and that's a shame, I don't want to think that, I want to enjoy and cherish the episodes. he meets her May 25th, 2013. He does? Did I miss something completely obvious somewhere? You haven't been paying much attention to this current season, have you? Apparently not. :) Basically, we know the event they meet and the day that event is. Being vague to keep from possible spoilers. :) Oh, there's an actual date? I must've missed that. Watch the \"Band or DJ?\" Episode. It'll work itself out. He does? Did I miss something completely obvious somewhere? I'm sorry, but it should've ended last season.

I thought S7 was pretty stale in the second half. It was almost like a chore \"ugh, I have to watch new episode\". I could literaly predict the plot for each episode some 4 min in. i thought it went downhill fast after S4. I agree, it want downhill, but it went from fantastic, to pretty good, at s5. By S6 it went to pretty okay, S7 meh and s8 is bleh. I always thought Series 5 was the worst. Series 6 was brilliant and series 7 was alright. Series 8 started slow but is now pretty good. THANK GOD Somebody feels teh same way as I do about Season 5. I think that season basically threw everything off. It's like they shot their load too early with Barney and Robin, realized it, then broke them up and then basically with that breakup, the heart of the show seemed to disappear. \n\nSeason 6 brought the heart back, but there were still remnants of Season 5 in there but most of it was done well. Season 7 wasn't bad but it wasn't great. This season started out slow and crappy but has really built up to be kind of good. I agree, it want downhill, but it went from fantastic, to pretty good, at s5. By S6 it went to pretty okay, S7 meh and s8 is bleh. i consider S5 to be the absolutely low-point of the series thus far.  the other seasons have had their moments but side-by-side, pound-for-pound the last 4 con't even compare to the first 4.   I'm sorry, but it should've ended last season. The writing has been getting worse (in my opinion) and more or less they're just rehashing old storylines at this point.

If the mother is going to be revealed in season 9, how are they going to end season 8? I can't take anymore cliffhangers. Probably end with Barney and Robin's wedding... then do the typical \"show no face pan away\" shot as Ted introduces himself to her... my best guess \"I think I'm in love with you.\"\n\n*roll credits* Probably end with Barney and Robin's wedding... then do the typical \"show no face pan away\" shot as Ted introduces himself to her... my best guess [spoiler](/s \"the only thing is she is the bass player at the wedding.\") [spoiler] (/s \"Too bad that's not her.\") huh? What did I miss? Nothing... I was just making a joke. Nothing... I was just making a joke. booooooooooo I\"m sorry I can't imagine MC Clap Yo Handz saying booooooooooo Probably end with Barney and Robin's wedding... then do the typical \"show no face pan away\" shot as Ted introduces himself to her... my best guess If the mother is going to be revealed in season 9, how are they going to end season 8? I can't take anymore cliffhangers. Praying it's the end of season cliffhanger and we meet her in the season 9 premier.  Praying it's the end of season cliffhanger and we meet her in the season 9 premier.   Let me get this strait. Ted meets the mother on May 25, but the season finale will be May 13. Season 9 will start in September, 4 months later. Will the beginning of season 9 just be a bunch of flashbacks? Is all of season 9 with him and the mother? I don't think that the show is matching up with real time, but I could be wrong. So just because the season premieres in September doesn't mean that the season's story will begin in September. They have matched up with real time until now, reasonably at least.  Aside from some delays in certain seasons, September has been September, and so on. They account for summer months differently though.  I recall the first episode of Season 2 picked up right where Season 1 left off at the beginning of summer 2006.  They also told the story of summer 2011 during the last episode of season 6.  So it's not unheard of for them to account for what happened between seasons either during the first or last episodes of a season.  Let me get this strait. Ted meets the mother on May 25, but the season finale will be May 13. Season 9 will start in September, 4 months later. Will the beginning of season 9 just be a bunch of flashbacks? Is all of season 9 with him and the mother? My theory: Ted first *sees* her at the wedding on May 25 (which may or may not happen in the season finale). But given that she stands next to him at the train station and they're not talking right away, it would seem they didn't actually \"meet\" at the wedding. Then he realizes he loves her slightly too late and spends a whole season tracking her down.\n\n[Sound familiar](http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/Victoria)? Given how many plot lines have been recycled lately, I wouldn't be surprised if this happens.  Let me get this strait. Ted meets the mother on May 25, but the season finale will be May 13. Season 9 will start in September, 4 months later. Will the beginning of season 9 just be a bunch of flashbacks? Is all of season 9 with him and the mother?  I hate to ruin the surprise .. but it's me. I hate to ruin the surprise .. but it's me. Your arm does look similar...\n\n CONFIRMED! This is the mother! Wha- .. How have you seen my arm?! :|  I'm sorry, but at this point, no matter who she is, there is no way she can live up to the hype.  This show stopped being How I Met Your Mother and became How Your Uncle Barney is Awesome a long time ago. I want to know what he's doing for a living!\n  I really hope Season 9 will be ''How I Married/Banged Your Mother''.  I'm pretty sure one of those has already been made.  And I think one might be a porno. As if marriage could ever be a porno. Right guys? The wedding is not being delayed.  In the flash forward Ted talks to Cindy about how the band cancelled at the last minute, Cindy suggests the Mother's band and even COMMENTS on the fact that they just had a gig cancel so they would be free \"this weekend.\"  It's happening in May. Everyone calm down.  \n\nWhat I think will happen is the season finale will focus on all the shit that makes Barney and Robins wedding have some hitches, as Ted mentions in the flash forward in the Farhampton episode.  It will end with Ted at the bus stop in the rain, he begins to meet the mother and right before her face gets revealed, we get the cliff hanger.  Episode one picks up where we left off and we actually get to know her and understand why we should be happy for Ted. Who cares if the show isn't so much about how Ted meets the mother but dates her?  Would fans really be happy with seeing the mother for a split second and the series ends?  I want to get to know her at least a little!\n\nBays and Thomas would be DUMB to stretch the next four months over a season and a half. I think even they know better  Spoiler: Barney goes Transgender.   Barney and Robin's wedding is May 25, 2013: **4 months from now**.  Ted meets the mother that night at Farhampton train station.\n\nSince the story Future Ted is telling follows present time, there are only two possible ways season 9 can exist:\n\n* The mother's face isn't revealed until s09e01 and the show becomes *How I Dated Your Mother*.  I feel this is acceptible.\n* The wedding gets pushed back.  This will infuriate the fans, and all but guarantees at least some, if not all, of season 9 is meaningless filler.\n\nBays and Thomas will make themselves into giant piles of confetti if they push the wedding back.  We've been waiting for it since s06e01... that's 3 bagpiping years. In the episode on 8/13 about the band or DJ, at the end they show Ted at the reception of the wedding and Robin dancing with her Father.  So they pretty clearly says they got married.\n\nI would be that it is the first one.  We will find out in the early in season 9 who the mother is, and then the time spent dating her will be the season.  After all \"How I met your mother?\" does have to me just the first meeting, the dating seems like it should be involved.\n\nEither way, I am glad they are putting a hard stop and giving us some closure on the series.  If there happens to be some sort of spin-off, which I could see, I'd be ok with that. There is no time stamp on that wedding scene. You are correct there.\n\nWe know it is at least Robin's because of the dance and in the beginning of the season he sees the base player at the train station.  I would like to think they aren't going to give us the run around like most TV shows and follow through with the Robin/Barney wedding, which would be on the date above. The only certainly definitive date we know of are the \"4 months later\" scene on the subway.  Every other mention of a wedding date is up in the air and manipulable by the writers:\n\nThe train station scene is still \"a little ways down the road\"\n\nNo time stamp on the wedding scene where Ted sees the bass player\nAlthough Barney and Robin announced the date of their wedding, the writers could always put in a reason to push it back a year \n\nThe \"4 months later\" subway scene does happen, but that doesn't definitively prove the wedding is still later that week; again, it could be written back a year\n\nMy only point is, the writers have left out solid information about the date of the wedding, so it may or may not happen at the end of this season I WILL STAB A CANADIAN IF THIS HAPPENS Pipe down, Hoosier. *Hoser.\n\n\nA Hooiser is someone from the state of Indiana.

Great, this means she'll be introduced in the season finale this spring. we now have a year to actually get to like her after our hearts get crushed with disappointment. Where did you read that? The article seemed to say that we won't meet her until sometime next season, presumably at the end.   To me the article didn't read as though someone explicitly said that she would be revealed next season. I can't imagine how they could drag it out much longer if she isn't at least introduced in this season's finale.    Do you guys think that they'll have multiple potential mothers that he meets at the wedding, and that season 9 will be all about trying to figure out which one it is?  In a last minute mixup, the entire band is bassists.    [Let's celebrate!](http://data.whicdn.com/images/50447869/tumblr_leqiabtW581qg83bjo1_500_large.gif_) You forgot your closing bracket champ. Thanks! It's just...I guess I was just really excited.     The only way that this can work is if it's a shortened season. Like 10 episodes or something. I can't see them going a full 24 and actually making it work.  Don't ever underestimate the producer's abilty to add filler episodes. They will make it work as long as the money keeps flowing.  So why bother watching the rest of season 8? It just seems like a fucking waste of time. WRAP THE SHOW UP ALREADY GOD DAMMIT.            \"Hey guys, Barney and Robin have delayed their wedding for a year due to some bullshit we'll explain with a throwaway line, now have a strung out arc about Lily having post partum and Ted having another hot/crazy girlfriend! Love, \"Cocktease\" Carter &amp; Bays\"  So if their wedding is at the end of this season, and he meets her AFTER their wedding, and WE meet her at the end of next season, you're telling me they're going to stretch a whole season of just Ted sitting on a bench until she walks up?\n\nI call craps. doesn't seem like too much of a stretch at this point.

And the manliest, strangely.  I mean are all the pictures at the same age? He seems older than the rest. If they all are the same age that just means he went through puberty sooner.  Cobie's looks like it's a highschool photo; same with Segal's. That's definitely NPH's Doogie days so ...wow, he was 16 in that photo. Pretty sure that's 14 year old Alison from My tepmother is an Alien. And with that jaw, I would imagine Ratner's like 20 or so? Yeah I feel like everyone else's are yearbook pictures or from acting as a child like you mentioned but Josh's looks like it's a head-shot. It doesn't look like he started acting until his early-mid twenties so he's probably almost/at least 10 years older than everyone else.  According to google, Cobie is the youngest in the cast at 30.  Jason is in his early 30's, and the rest are in their late 30's.  Neil Patrick Harris is the oldest at 39. I don't mean how old they are now, I mean how old they are in the pictures. like dudemann said Alyson's picture is from \"My Stepmother is an Alien\" when she was 14, NPH's from Doogie Howser when he was about 16, Cobie and Jason's both look like they're high school yearbook pictures which would make them 14-18 but Josh's looks like a head-shot an actor would submit with their resume. Given Josh's first credited acting job was when he was 26 even if this was he first he's probably at least 24 or so in the picture, so 6-10 years old than the others are in their picture.  Ah, gotcha.  I thought you were talking about their actual ages.  I never understood why they can't just pull everyone's senior yearbook photo for consistency when doing these comparisons.  It's ridiculous to see an adult Radnor headshot next to Cobie's yearbook photo as though they were the same thing. Yeah, that would make the most sense, and is probably what would happen if this was made by a journalist for a magazine or CBS for a promo or something but I'm pretty sure this was just made by someone bored on the internet who googled \"Young.. alyson hannigan, josh radnor etc\" and then stuck them all together to make a jpeg. It's not like the average can, or will find out where they went to school and dig up their old yearbooks. I mean are all the pictures at the same age? He seems older than the rest. If they all are the same age that just means he went through puberty sooner.  And the manliest, strangely.  Josh looks exactly the same.  Josh looks exactly the same.   Alyson Hannigan is NEVER not hot. Ahh...you apparently stopped watching the show after season 5. Season 7, episode 3, Lily's boobs. Need I say more? Boobs do not compensate for a face that used to have incredibly cute perkiness, but is now sort of....saggy? Is that the word? I agree she isn't as hot, BUT I hypothesize that they are using make-up to make it look like she is going through the strains of, first pregnancy, then have to raise a kid (not to mention teaching kindergarten). That kind of stress can visibly droop a person's face and make someone appear less attractive. I think the writers/make-up artists are trying to convey that. Boobs do not compensate for a face that used to have incredibly cute perkiness, but is now sort of....saggy? Is that the word? Boobs do not compensate for a face that used to have incredibly cute perkiness, but is now sort of....saggy? Is that the word? I bet your face is perfectly perky, then! Why don't you go on TV and show us how it is to be hot all the time. Ahh...you apparently stopped watching the show after season 5. This comment is gross. Who cares; she's still a funny, beautiful, talented actress. Sorry she doesn't fit in your box of youthful hotness, I'm sure she loses sleep at night about that. Alyson Hannigan is NEVER not hot. she looks fantastic in this pic. She also looks 12. Not that I'm arguing anyone, just something to keep in mind. Honestly she doesn't look twelve to me here or maybe its becase i haven't slept yet and im a bit delusional. But i was only complimenting her lol. She also looks 12. Not that I'm arguing anyone, just something to keep in mind. I'm assuming you think she looks 12 because you're a bit older. She looks at least 16-18 to me, but I'm 24 and still see high schoolers all of the time.  I'm assuming you think she looks 12 because you're a bit older.

Cobie Smulders looks a bit like Milly from Freaks and Geeks.  Radnor is DEFINITELY not the same age as the rest in these pictures.  Yeah NPH looks like he is 8 years old, still classy as fuck though, really wish he was adjusting that tie with his hand...  Barney has been wearing a tie since he was six years old hahaha He had to be professional since he worked at the hospital Dirty sneakers aside  ....... how does Ted not age? He's saving his regeneration energy for when he transforms into Bob Saget. Ted is the Doctor?\n\nSo that explains why he's spent so long looking for a 'companion'.\n\n/r/ShittyFanTheories Ted is the doctor after he loses Amy and Rory in New York and starts looking for a new companion because it's dangerous to travel alone. It all makes sense now He's saving his regeneration energy for when he transforms into Bob Saget. ....... how does Ted not age?  Cobie Smulders had a successful puberty!      This says it's from 9Gag on the left side.... So? they're supposed to steal content from reddit, not the other way around. reddit is so but hurt about all this. Of course we're butthurt. Because we complain how they steal and don't give us credit. Obviously 9GAG made that. And I see no other credit than that.  Do you pirate music? What's that matter.  This is about 9gag stealing from reddit. And resdit stealing from 9gag. It's the same thing.  I really don't care when someone makes silly content like rage comics and publishes to one website and someone else takes it and shares it on another website. Why does it matter at all? If you pirate music, even that is a bigger deal that this.\n\nThis reddit vs 9gag thing is so fucking childish. Why do you care?                 \"My balls didn't drop until I was 16\"- NPH          Alyson is the HOT here     Damn, Cobie still looked good Really? WTF is up with her lip!? \nShe is not very pretty in this photo! \n\nThen again.. I don't even think she is hot now but that's just opinions. She has her moments though. It could be the picture but yeah, her lips look a bit different. That being said, she is a good looking lady, in my opinion. I wouldn't call her a lady in this picture. Too young!

The entire show in some ways has been about Ted THINKING he wants to be with Robin. Barney falling in love/marrying her plays a part in showing him how he was wrong about that because he meets The Mother the day of their wedding. Since the show has been mostly Ted getting over Robin, it could be said that Barney got him a great story out of it. The story he is telling his kids and all of us.      It's amazing all the subtleties you find when rewatching shows like this    The Klaus bit resonated with me along similar lines. Robin and Ted connect on many positive fundamental levels, but that doesn't mean you can forge a lifelong romantic relationship off it it unless it's genuinely meant to be.\n\nI have a woman friend who I would never pick on paper to be my wife, and in practice there is a genuine love there - I can relate to almost any romantic feelings out there, minus the romance - but because The Feeling isn't there, the spark, the draw where you both know...because I can question it...if it were here, I'd be uncomfortable with the notion. She's the almost. SO almost that it's kind of nuts because of the work it took and how unlikely it seems anyone will even get as close as her, though she's not in the running.\n\nShe's just not the Lifelong Treasure of Destiny.

I'm fairly sure even they don't know who the mother is, though I suspect Robin was planned to be if it never got picked up for Season 2 They always held a possibility open for someone to be the mother (e.g. Robin, Victoria) at the end of a season if the series wasn't renewed for a new season.

You clever fan! I don't think that's a fair thing to say. Fans have been able to predict things, sometimes even right down the line in a variety of shows. Don't doubt the fans.\n\n Predict things? Sure. Predict a show's deepest-held secret? Rarely. To be honest, I don't think the secret really works that way. They've never really had a concrete plan as for what was going to happen, hence why there were backup mothers throughout the series. \n\nAnd, despite the fact that we don't know who the mother actually is - which let's be honest, is something we can't know as its a matter of casting - people did predict who the mother was/how Ted would meet her. All the more reason to not take fan theories seriously. Nearly all that I have read depend on multi-season pseudo-plotpoints, and given that the writers have had no concrete plan, any \"signs\" of evidence is completely unreliable.\n\nIs it possible a fan theory may end up right? Sure, it's possible. My experience with fan theories so far will keep me from taking any of them seriously, however. Fan theories are at best, guesses, and I'd rather just have some patience and wait to see who the mother is when it happens naturally rather than wondering which random guess might possibly be accurate, if any. I'm pretty sure it is Ranjeet though.   I'm 100% certain that I know who the mother is and they have already shown her. It was the Saint Patricks Day episode a few years ago. Season 3 episode called \"No Tomorrow\". Ted is out with Barney in a bar and Ted is being a collosal jackass, putting drinks on another guys tab, hitting on a married chick and other stupid things. If you remember at the end of that episode is when he finds the yellow umbrella. The mother was at that bar that night. At one point, it is very brief, Ted bumps into a woman while walking in the bar. After he hits her he turns around and apologizes in passing and she does the same. While they do this, she lingers and smiles before he turns around. She is a brunette and could be described as similar in appearance to Robin. I am sure that is the mother. This show is brilliant at putting in small clues about future events. Ted doesn't remember her because he was really drunk. \n\nTake a look at the episode and it will all make perfect sense.  Screencapped this, and I will see you when the mother is revealed. We shall see then if you are happy to see me or not.

The house was already better looking and yeah.. ): \nI just want them to mention it again at least, we know that's where he lives with his family. I believe it wasn't an option for him when he was searching for a new place. The whole house was in a pretty bad shape when he bought it. In Disaster Averted, Ted was planning to bring the gang in the house, thinking it would be a safe place during the hurricane. He says at the end of the episode that a tree fell in the living room, and, they could have been smashed if they were there. So I guess he is still in the process of fixing all this which is a lot of work, especially if he is planing this by himself, as suggested when he bought it. I'd assume he's doing that when he's free, and we know he was busy with the GNB project. But this is just a speculation, it would be nice if they clear that up.  If I remember correctly when hurricane Irene passed over NY a tree fell on the building. So I assume it is getting fixed. Or has renters. In my opinion, I don't think it was mentioned on the show, that he bought the house for the kids and the mother to live in. So many he is waiting until he meets the mother?  i remember a episode when a guy goes through the house and checks it for damage, and at the end of the episode he tells the kids that the house is the one they live in today\n i remember a episode when a guy goes through the house and checks it for damage, and at the end of the episode he tells the kids that the house is the one they live in today\n   I mean, he bought the place and there was a time Ted didn't have a place to live.

S07E10 - Ted says 'to this day, Barney and Robin swear this is the song they danced to'. Sure, it's just one line, but that's my takeaway with the present tense. it could also be that Robin has recently passed away and the story is Teds way of explaining what Robin meant to Ted.

Also there was a episode where Robin was worried that her mother had found a lump in her breasts. Death by breast cancer? Oh God I hate this. It's horrible, and will cause all of the feels. \n\nWhich means it's the most likely to be true, of course. :(  Yes, it's been mentioned before, but here are my thoughts on that little potentiality: Future Ted goes so far as to tell his kids the part of the story concerning Victoria telling him twice about Robin, the first that his previous relationships never lasted because of her, and the second that she hoped that he does, eventually, end up with her. \n\nThis concerns two variables - that the mother is somehow no longer in the equation, and that Barney and Robin get divorced. I can see the former happening, dead or split, but the second at this point would just seem like a kick in the nards with how much effort they've recently put into showing the sort of bond Barney and Robin had/have. \n\nBleh. I'unno, man. Woah woah woah, isn't there speculation that Barney is dead??? What if that is also the case, then the bond between Robin and Barney wouldn't seem so superficial.    No. None of this is happening. It's a comedy show and the writers are not dark like that. If the Carly theory did not happen then none of these wacko theories will either No. None of this is happening. It's a comedy show and the writers are not dark like that. If the Carly theory did not happen then none of these wacko theories will either I dunno, remember the [ending](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBW_oN9a404) to Roseanne? I dunno, remember the [ending](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBW_oN9a404) to Roseanne?  I doubt they'd get the kids to act all bored and uninterested if that were the case.\n\nAlso, he says one of her painting is hanging in their den as they speak so unless she just died, she still paints stuff regularly.         I have thought this from time to time,with closing out a show at a high peak in its popularity like they seem to be planning on. They have to make it memorable,if ted just meets some random and the show ends no one will be satisfied with that ending however if it comes full circle and ted and robin end up living the life ted  has constantly fantasied of with two kids,that also didnt stop robin doing the things she wanted like travel and so forth and plus she can't have kids so i think it could tie together to a sligtly satisfing end to the show I would be satisfied if he meets some random and it ends. In fact, that is probably the best ending for the show. The show is not at all about the mother. It's about the five people we see every week. The mother is just a device used to move the show along.

It's weird that he keeps her little bus and the painting in the den then.  That would line up better with the theory that the mother is dead by the time he is telling the story and that the whole point of the story is for the kids to better understand why he is now pursuing their Aunt Robin (Barney is dead also, that is why he is remembered so larger than life and full of energy.)

(not my favorite theory btw) I'm pretty sure the barney is dead theory was disproven, I can't remember why though. I hope so, I have been watching the show and I don't remember any trace of an \"old\" Barney, the only flash forwards of Barney I remember at the moment are when they are seeing the Star Wars trilogy after Ted's daughter is born and when he was faking his death (that could just have been a Barney's fantasy.)\n\nI just wouldn't like the show to involve death to such degree or for its final message be something like \"its ok to suffer years for someone, maybe their SO will die before you.\"   She's wearing purple. Is there some sort of importance to that??  Yes, actually. Someone around here mentioned before that the mother is always symbolized with the color yellow, as with the yellow umbrella and yellow toy bus. Robin is associated with purple. In this episode, Victoria's in purple too. In the color wheel, purple is the opposite of yellow.    [deleted] [deleted] Season 1 Victoria was perfect (she was the potential mother if they never got a season 2, so its easy to see why they made her like that). Season 7 and 8 Victoria is like a completely different character that just happens to be played by the same actress. Season 7\\8 victoria completely disappointed me, especially the reason she ended up leaving him.  Someone who was that determined to leave for another guy suddenly has misgivings about marrying him because Robin is still around but didn't mind before the proposal and never bothered to tell Ted beforehand - before, y'know, leaving Klaus at the altar? With all of those relationships early this season it all seemed like excuses to get rid of them. Suddenly Quinn and Barney realize they can't trust each other after all that but they're good together otherwise? Suddenly Robin realizes that guy is a moron? Suddenly Victoria is a paranoid, messy bitch? It was all pretty defunct, to me at least. She was right about Robin being the reason most of his other relationships failing though. Not really. Here's my work:\n\n\u2022 Karen - Lily, and himself after he breaks it off because of the way she thinks of them.\n\n\u2022 Stella - This one I'll grant you, but only to a point. Robin's mere presence there was why Ted went to get Tony and her daughter, *as a result of Barney lying that Robin was on here way*. He was going to call and tell her not to come. He told her that he wanted to be with Stella after Robin tried to stop him. Stella chose otherwise.\n\n\u2022 Zoey - Yes, but again, technicality. Robin and Lily both convinced him to save his career instead of the relationship because either way they were both convinced it would end bitterly.\n\nOne could argue the latter scenarios are more relevant to her intervention, but in both scenarios Ted expresses no interest at those points in her. Otherwise, everyone he dated had little to no interaction with Robin, didn't last more than an episode (except for Carly Whittaker if she's still around in the next few episodes).

Probably a shadowbox set with three walls, but I'm not sure. Ted's apartment definitely is, and it would explain the shot patterns.

How would that work? Movable fourth wall. 90% of shots are from the \"front\" of the apartment, facing the back. They can also shoot at something like a 70 degree angle without exposing the lack of fourth wall, which may account for that.
