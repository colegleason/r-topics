    "title" : "Is it possible to own something without a principle like non-aggression?",
    "snippet" : "Edit: Does ownership exist if others are able to just aggress the thing owned without consequences?\n\nThat is: If A can aggress B's thing they own (C) without repercussion, then did B really own C?\n\nMy guess is that someone in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism can come up with a better way to phrase the question.\n  It's really a question of semantics. Is what you call \"ownership\" a claim about how people *should* act with regard to C, or is it a claim about how people *do in fact* act with regard to C?\n\nIf it's a claim about how people should act, then B may own C even if in practical terms he cannot stop others from violating his property claim.\n\nIf it's a claim about how people do act, then B probably can't be said to own C, since B does not exercise exclusive control over C. I don't think it is a question of ability (how people do act) because of the repercussion cavet added to the question.\n\nIt may be a question of how people \"should act\" but, again, there is that repercussion cavet. If we removed the repercussion cavet, then it is probably a \"should act\". Whether or not A can aggress against B's C without repercussion is indeed a factual question, i.e. how people do act. It lies on the \"fact\" side of the \"fact/value\" dichotomy.\n\nIf A can violate C without repercussion, does that mean B did not own C? It depends on what you mean by \"own\". You could certainly define ownership in terms of whether or not A will be faced with repercussions for violating C. In that case we could say that B did not own C.\n\nYou could alternatively define ownership in terms of whether A would be justified in violating C. In that case, the ability to avoid repercussion would have no bearing on whether or not B owns C. Wow. This is really helpful (I mean that in a positive way).\n\n&gt; It depends on what you mean by \"own\".\n\nI had asked a [question here](http://redd.it/17hhrs) and consensus seems to be that without the concept of owning something (and we hadn't defined that yet) then there can be no aggression/theft. That is, if we have a concept of aggression/theft/etc. then we have some kind of concept of ownership. So...\n\nThe next question to ask (after this one) is what properties make up the concept of ownership given theft/aggression exists.\n\nI do think there are logical limits to the definition of and/or a logical way to define ownership based on the concept of theft/aggression (fact side of fact/value distinction). \n\n&gt; A would be justified in violating C\n\nI guess if A was justified in violating C, then it was not aggression (A did not initiate the force). The original question was in the context of aggression and not violence in general.\n\nI'm really phrasing the question wrong. If I were to say something like we can't have the concept of ownership when something can be taken via aggression. Or, as long as people can aggress others, and we have a system that allows for that aggression, then we really have no ownership at all. As such, there is no theft, etc. Words are defined in ways that facilitate certain goals in communication. What is your goal when communicating about ownership?\n\nDo you want to communicate about how people should act with respect to objects?\n\nOr do you want to communicate about how people do act with respect to objects?\n\nAnswer that question first, then much of the rest follows. You have to define your intent before you can figure out which words and definitions help you satisfy that intent. It seems to be that communication based on how people should act don't get too far. I am more interested in attempting to take a logical/scientific approach on describing how things actually interact.\n\nSo, I feel it would be in our best interest if definitions align with this logical/scientific approach.\n\nCan we logically show that the definition of ownership would be incomplete without non-aggression being a factor of that definition? Perhaps that is a better question than \"Is it possible to own something without non-aggression\"?\n\n(and I greatly appreciate your patience in this discussion). If you just want to describe the facts of the situation, then you might be best served by a definition of ownership which implies the factual capability of B to exclude A from C, and/or implies that A would face sufficient repercussions to deter them from violating C.\n\nIn that sense, I don't think you need non-aggression first before ownership obtains, and I don't think you need ownership first before non-aggression obtains. They are two ways of saying the same thing; neither one comes before the other. I really like this definition of ownership and the general approach to definitions that you've taken. Thank you.   As people have said, it depends on your definition. I like to think of ownership as a way of designating that you are using something, so that people know that if they start trying to use it for something else, it will cause problems.  In this sense, ownership exists regardless of what anyone else thinks or does.\n\nAs far as having unstoppable agents of the state around, it does not change the ethical analysis of the situation, just the practical analysis. You may have a right to use something, but if jack-booted thugs are coming to take it, it may not be worth trying to enforce that right.  Self-ownership is usually used as one of the axioms leading to the NAP, so a kind of ownership logically precedes the NAP.\n\nThe NAP is a broad rule that includes several kinds of aggression. Property theft, harm to a person's body (their property also), and then possibly some more complex or controversial cases like encirclement, abortion, childrens' rights, the sorts of things that generate active discussion on r/ancap.\n\nSome people think all of the above constitute the NAP, and that the principle of the NAP is not upheld without all of those constraints. We can imagine a society that upholds ownership of things and doesn't protect children particularly well.\n\ntl;dr yes, but it depends on the formulation of the NAP  I've been working on this a while and here is where I am. \n\nIn reality (not a moral system)  a person(s) only can claim property. This means a person or group say to everyone else that this thing (land, car, digital copy of a movie) is theirs to do what they want with and nobody can have it.\n\nThe question is how do other people react to this claim? They can either respect the claim or not. If they don't respect it they can chose to violate the claim or not. The person(s) making the claim can try to protect against aggression or not.\n\nThese are the basic scenarios in reality. Every economic and moral system establish which variation of these is permissible.  I've read over ~~you~~ your definition of ownership quite a few times and I like the approach in general. I am not sure if we could, in reality, describe what that actual claim process is. Could we?\n\nCurrently, that Claim is done via some kind of proof of ownership and a 3rd party uses that poof to determine if there was ownership (when someone else doesn't respect that claim).\n\nIn your definition, it seems like there would be a lot of people walking around saying they don't respect a claim. Perhaps if there was one or more 3rd parties by which that claim is \"filed\" and, hopefully, others recognise (similar to people recognising a claim to property) one or more of those 3rd parties.\n\nThank you for the feedback. I was just trying to establish all of the possibilities. I wasn't advocating a moral system here. This is just a process of sorting systems by following this logic and how each system handles these questions.\n\nSo take the US right now for example in the case of land. There are various people with various claims to the land. I say I own my land. But the county charges me property taxes. Also the county, state, and federal government have all sorts of claims about how I can use it and under what circumstances they can take it away.\n\nSo lets say I \"claim\" my land. The state government comes by and wants to put a highway through my house. They don't respect my claim. I can either try to fight them or not. If I fight them and take them to court the court can rule against me. I still have the choice to give up or try to prevent them from taking the property. The ultimate outcome depends on if I can rally other citizens to support my claim and threaten to vote out the politicians. Ya. I could see that in your post your weren't trying to advocate a moral system. What I didn't see in your initial post that there was a 3rd party involved - in this case a court system of some kind. You can include third parties in the persons trying to defend the claim. Wouldn't a third party be trying to verify a claim? A third party could rule the claim valid or invalid which is different from specifically defending it. Sure they could try to \"verify\" a claim but then what?    Let me try and rephrase this....\n\nIf A is in possession of the capability to exercise enough force that B cannot respond in any effective way to A taking C from B, then is it any less theft?\n\nExample: if A has a gun and B does not.  And A uses that gun to threaten B to demand their wallet...does the fact that B surrenders the wallet mean that B never really owned it?  No. \n\n2nd Example:  The US has weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear) and Canada does not.  Given that few would attempt to defend Canada, can the US simply take possession of their territory?  Does this mean that Canada never really owned it?  What about Mexico? I think the repercussion cavet is an important part of the question. It is not a question about the ability/capability of keeping something. It is a question of non-aggression.\n\nDoes ownership exist if others are able to just take the thing owned without consequences? I think the repercussion cavet is an important part of the question. It is not a question about the ability/capability of keeping something. It is a question of non-aggression.\n\nDoes ownership exist if others are able to just take the thing owned without consequences?",

Incorrect, it doesn't matter how much new wealth is created in a situation where the players need for wealth cannot be satiated. I don't see how an infinite number of desires invalidates the fact that you can produce more wealth than you consume. Then you didn't read your own sentence.\n\nI'll de-downvote you but it really annoys me when people talk in pre-made arguments. The zero sum fallacy has been made a lot, the fact that you don't like that someone else has already explained why it's a fallacy is irrelevant.

Glen Beck's *Blaze* -- your go to place for libertarian news! So how often has *Blaze* been linked on this subreddit? Does the discussion of this article *at all* warrant criticism? Does the fact that Beck owns *Blaze* mean that the article can be rejected without further inspection?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the article? Sounds like they plan to use what sounds to be a Georgist \"single tax\". Sounds interesting. It's an experiment that bears watching.\n\nGlenn Beck clearly is moving in a libertarian direction. That's where opportunity lies. Whether you want your belief system associated with him is a question you (collectively) need to answer. I totally agree. I'm wary of Beck's move, but maybe the promotion of at least semi-decent libertarianism is in his best interests. Perhaps, he'll do some good even if his motives are opportunistic. Most of the people I talk to outside of my closest friends already think I'm a nutjob when I say I'm libertarian.  For myself, Glenn Beck moving in is the exact opposite of helping the movement. I'd just ask those people specifically what they disagree with Beck on. Usually, they have never listened to him to an extent that they can actually recall his opinions (ime). Not saying I agree with Beck beyond a general small government sentiment though.\n\nTalk is cheap. I'm not banking on anarcho-capitalism becoming popular and culturally acceptable. It will just happen as the market increasingly out-competes nation states, probably in a gradual way.

Something like this could be like Hong Kong was for mainland China.  Getting in on the ground floor of a deal like that would be a super opportunity. I don't think citizenship is really a \"ground floor\" kind of thing.  If anything, I would expect the price to go down once the initial investment has been paid off and they start to make a profit.      If I had $300,000 then I wouldn't need to live in a free market utopia. I would be just fine in the regular US. \"Freemarket utopias\" seem a lot more relevant to me for people trying to come up in the world and make their fortune. If you are already well off you got nothing to bitch about. \n\nTry living in the world of not being able to get your kids the medical attention they need because all you can afford is medicaid which is practically fucking useless. Try living in a world where your total allotment of food stamps is adjusted each month based on your income so that you never have enough money to live on or get ahead. You try that and suddenly a freemarket utopia doesn't seem so bad. Well only if you are given some means of production at the beginning to make your way. \n\nBut to pay in such an extreme amount of money? Or having to work for somebody in a place where there are no protections for labor? No thanks. Protections for labor?  I labor in the U.S. and I don't feel very protected.  In fact, I feel downright shit on by the government.  I make slightly more than poverty wages and they take one of every five dollars I make.  If I had 20% more wealth, I'd protect my own damn self. Oh I'm not saying that our state is awesome and the labor protections it provides are amazing and what I would want. But just by way of example my former colleagues and I worked for a decade in a basement with very poor air quality, mold, dead critters and the occasional flood. Ten fucking years our managers did nothing about this while people who worked there got sicker and sicker. They actually bitched at us for being so sickly from their nice third floor offices with windows.\n\nWell it literally only took one anonymous phone call to OSHA that precipitated an air quality inspection and suddenly our bosses couldn't remodel that basement fast enough. We got all new furniture, flooring, two big ass air purifiers and actual real ventilation installed. The building was also inspected and some of the obvious entryways for rats and whatever else (one co-worker didn't realize she had a bat hanging from her ceiling for hours one day) were blocked off.\n\nSo yeah I get it. Our pay isn't fair and the lower level you work at the worse you are paid and the more work is expected from you. But in an anarcho-capitalist \"utopia\" my former colleagues and I would still be working in that shit basement and I highly doubt our pay would have been any better. &gt; Ten fucking years our managers did nothing about this while people who worked there got sicker and sicker. They actually bitched at us for being so sickly from their nice third floor offices with windows.\n\nEmployment is free at will in the US. Why didn't you guys just quit if you didn't approve of the working conditions? How is coercion justifiable in this instance?  Because the job market sucks. Getting new jobs isn't easy and that itself is a coercive force. For ten years the job market sucked? Sounds like laziness to me. Just saying. ",

Why should we not make them slaves?  Maybe the NAP is only enforceable when people want to enforce it.

I guess it's a good start for churning some ideas on this. \n\nSeems like their strategy was simply to cleanse anyone who wasn't on board. It also seems like there were definite efforts to disarm Jewish citizens. \n\n&gt;On November 11, 1938, the Minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, promulgated Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons. This regulation effectively deprived Jews of the right to possess firearms or other weapons\n\nYour point is great though. As individual philosophers we should question everything, even cliche \"that's what Hitler did!\" that sound comfortable.  I get tired of the \"Hitler\" thing too, but we can't erase history.  We should be able to discuss the situation and hopefully make our own conclusions.\n\nThis article is very long, but well sourced and complete.  If you want to know about Nazi Gun Laws, read this.  It's written by Stephen Halbrook, an attorney who specializes in Constitutional cases.\n\n[NAZI FIREARMS LAW AND THE DISARMING OF THE GERMAN JEWS](http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/article-nazilaw.pdf) PDF Warning - \nArizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, No. 3, 483-535 (2000)\n\nFrom page 520, 521\n\nNovember 10, 1938\n\nThe SS Reichsführer (Himmler) and German Police Chief has issued\nthe following Order:\n\nPersons who, according to the Nürnberg law, are regarded as Jews,\nare forbidden to possess any weapon.  Violaters will be condemned\nto a concentration camp and imprisoned for a period of up to 20\nyears.\n Great find! Thanks for sharing :). \n\nIt seems now that there wasn't a nation wide confiscation like is feared today, but a specific targeting of people who weren't \"in\". \n\nHonestly, how hard would a targeted disarming be today? I feel like people would really get behind \"if a mental health professional deems you x, y, or z, then you are unfit to own a gun\".  Hasn't it been proven that Hitler didn't round up fire arms? I see what the author is implying and I agree; children through out history have been used as a catalyst for draconian laws. But let's keep our arguments in check with the reality of history. Nazi Weapons Act of 1938\n\n*    Classified guns for \"sporting purposes\".\n*    All citizens who wished to purchase firearms had to register with the Nazi officials and have a background check.\n*    Presumed German citizens were hostile and thereby exempted Nazis from the gun control law.\n*   Gave Nazis unrestricted power to decide what kinds of firearms could, or could not be owned by private persons.\n*    The types of ammunition that were legal were subject to control by bureaucrats.\n*    Juveniles under 18 years could not buy firearms and ammunition.\n* Jews were forbidden from the manufacturing or dealing of firearms and ammunition\n\nIn Austria, they passed sweeping firearms restrictions aver being voted in and then confiscated them shortly thereafter.\n I thought this was a really good read: http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/12/24/she-survived-hitler-and-wants-to-warn-america/\n\nIt addresses the progression of the political climate in Austria, culminating with the disarmament of the people.\n\nThis was posted over in /r/Libertarian . We aren't electing openly fascist, openly racist people who openly want to kill the entire left is the thing. I thought this was a really good read: http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/12/24/she-survived-hitler-and-wants-to-warn-america/\n\nIt addresses the progression of the political climate in Austria, culminating with the disarmament of the people.\n\nThis was posted over in /r/Libertarian .  Thought I was in /r/Republican for a second... Thought I was in /r/Republican for a second...  This looks like as good a place as any for a tiny soapbox...\n\nWe're oversaturated in Hitler demonization. Obviously he was terrible, I'm not negating that. The problem is that he, a single human, became the personification of all the evils of Nazism and the Holocaust. He's the scapegoat for something way bigger than one person. Now he's little more than a caricature, a scarier and more frequently invoked symbol of evil than Satan himself. All the focus on him distracts from the [philosophies underpinning his rise to power and the willing obeisance of the German people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okPnDZ1Txlo). When you saddle everything on Hitler it's a lot easier to look at today's American culture and ignore the fact that many of the same themes are still alive and well here in the land of the free. But without the swastikas and sieg heils it's easy to dismiss as different that which is fundamentally the same.\n\nAnd thus we end up with this, where any legitimate comparisons between contemporary America and fascist Germany boil down to shallow \"Obama vs. Hitler\" rhetoric without considering any deeper societal correlations. Of course Obama and Hitler are two very different people. But their worldviews are grounded in surprisingly similar beliefs about the nature and methodologies of government. Thanks for posting this.  Let me TL;DR: We just need to get the right people in office.    \"The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.\"\n\nMein Kampf, Adolf Hitler Or not? http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Mein_Kampf#Dropped_quotes     This is ridiculous.  Just because someone thinks it's a good idea to invite children for the purpose of looking good does not mean they are some how an evil dictator.      And Hitler was a vegetarian. So all vegetarians are Nazis. \n\nHoly fuck.  And Hitler was a vegetarian. So all vegetarians are Nazis. \n\nHoly fuck. ",

    "snippet" : "How many folks here volunteer their time and donate to charity?  I think this topic has come up before, but I still think it's interesting.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be spending some time serving food at a daytime shelter that also provides laundry services, showers, social services, etc.  It is my belief that if we are to promote a society based on voluntary actions and charity, we should walk the walk.  Is this something the majority of other people in this group do?\n\nAs an aside, I think volunteering and asking others to join our efforts is a positive way to influence others' ideas about AnCaps.  I would like to think a lot of us prefer stateless society *because* it would provide a better form of welfare.  \n\n  A monthly contribution to khanacademy.org\n\nIt's not the same as a \"charity\" I guess but I still see it as the most good I can do with a buck. It's better than charity!  Agreed. I don't generally give to people on the side of freeway off-ramps with signs, nor people in front of supermarkets with red Salvation Army kettles - But rather I choose, Wikipedia, a rare podcast or 'politician,'  and of course $2 donations to Stef ;-) &gt;$2 donations to Stef\n\nHaha, we should have organized and all sent him two cent donations. It costs money to record a credit card transaction, and if the fee he pays is higher than the donation, of course he's going to be irritated.\n\nSaying that, was he a douche about it? Absolutely. I feel like the person who gave the donation was more of a douche... knowing that it costs money and that he was gonna lose money for it... Stef's reaction was reasonable. I know I would of done the same. How do you know the donor was aware of credit card processing fees?            I do.  I've read some work by libertarians of various stripes that suggests it's a counter-productive activity, but then I put it to the \"What would Grandma say?\" test.  Grandma says volunteer and donate.  Grandma wins. What is counter-productive about it?       Nah, I don't believe in charity like that.  Where I'm giving with people is with those in my local life and how I help them however I can with their pursuit of happiness, be it education, humor, sports and games, chatting, or encouragement.\n\nI will always help a stranger educate themselves within reason, but I don't believe in 'food for the poor' kind of charity as it feels too short term.  I don't feel good about that kind of stuff and find it kind of lame.  It certainly *could* have a place; one could conceive of a person who needs food, shelter, and/or medical attention immediately and, when I perceive that, I don't mind helping, but today the 'food assistance' programs make me feel like I'm robbing the person of self-actualization.\n\nWhen I help someone who feels lost and uncertain what to do with themselves, that is when I feel best, when I know they can better look after themselves and create for themselves their own happiness. A lot of people who utilize daytime shelters and food assistance programs do it temporarily, though when they come across hard times.  Many of them are single moms who are caring for multiple children. &gt;Many of them are single moms who are caring for multiple children.\n\nI just would rather direct my efforts to fixing the medium- to long-term structural problems than something like that.  It'd just feel like I was fighting an endless tide of hungry mouths.\n\nBut, I'm not going to get in the way of those who like the shorter-term stuff. &gt;I don't believe in charity like that.\n\n&gt;But, I'm not going to get in the way of those who like the shorter-term stuff.\n\nI'm not being facetious, I'd just like to clarify: You don't think any short term charity is ethical, but it's not a big enough injustice to verbally protest?\n\n&gt;It certainly could have a place; one could conceive of a person who needs food, shelter, and/or medical attention immediately and, when I perceive that, I don't mind helping\n\nSo you do believe in it then, right? Because it does have a place. Cleaning a highway, donating to local food banks (or anywhere people faced with temporary rough times go for assistance; not talking about those who are potentially in long-term rough times by their own poor decisions), etc. What does ethics have to do with it? He is just stating a preference. I couldn't tell whether he was stating a preference, which is normally characterized by \"I like/prefer to/don't usually\", or stating an ethical stance, which I often see worded as \"I don't believe in\". Sorry! No worries. \"Ethics\" is just one of those words that I seen thrown around that most people don't always know what they mean by it. I like to ask to get people to think about the semantics of that word. I suppose that it would be more accurate for me to say that I often see \"I don't believe in\" used to preface moral beliefs. I did throw \"ethics\" out a little too loosely, good call.  Sure, donating on your own free will is fine. It's really up to the individual what they do... But, wouldn't it be better to do an exchange? I could hand you five dollars, but I could also trade you five dollars for something you have or can do for me. See in the end of scenario #2 you have 5 dollars, but now I have something too! We are both better off, therefore trade will always be better than charity.  Not if I feel better from volunteering. it's still an exchange, they get something, and you feel good.  [deleted] right, so your basically paying for good feelings. The service they provide you is the feeling of giving them your pity.  You must really like Ayn Rand.\n\n---- who said the only volunteerism I perform is for \"needy?\" Why are you being so argumentative about this... You clearly receive some benefit from volunteering or you wouldn't do it. That doesn't cheapen the fact that you're doing (IMO) a good thing, but to imply that you receive nothing in a voluntary exchange is simply disingenuous.  it's still an exchange, they get something, and you feel good.  Sure, donating on your own free will is fine. It's really up to the individual what they do... But, wouldn't it be better to do an exchange? I could hand you five dollars, but I could also trade you five dollars for something you have or can do for me. See in the end of scenario #2 you have 5 dollars, but now I have something too! We are both better off, therefore trade will always be better than charity.    Many/Most organizations that market themselves as charity are very *\"corrupt\"* and inefficient.  When I do altruistic activities, it's usually not through organizations that call themselves charities.  I volunteer. It is mostly church stuff, but a lot of the work done crosses over into improving society too.\n\nHere is an amusing anecdote. I visited my parents and started talking about a chemistry website I was making, and how a lot of people searching for homework help end up there. \n\nMy mother replied \"that's so good to hear, I was starting to think you were a conservative!\". Since from their perspective, no one could simultaneously want to privatize education while personally be giving it away for free.   ",

I would say that their writings are in support of propaganda as the word was initially intended: a title of esteem.

They are an ordered more or less consistent picture of the world, to which our habits, our tastes, our capacities, our comforts and our hopes have adjusted themselves. They may not be a complete picture of the world, but they are a picture of a possible world to which we are adapted. In that world, people and things have their well-known places, and do certain expected things. We feel at home there. We fit in. We are members.[...] \n\n&gt;It is not merely a short cut. It is all these things and something more. It is the guarantee of our self-respect; it is the projection upon the world of our own sense or our own value, our own position, and our own rights. [...] They are the fortress of our traditions, and behind its defenses we can continue to feel ourselves safe in the position we occupy.” \n\n",

    "title" : "The Social Functions of Profits | Robert P. Murphy",
    "snippet" : "   The issue with this video is that it doesn't speak the language of the people who believe profits are undesirable. To the radical left, profits are a laborless income, and thus are undeserving of income.\n\nProfit is laborless because the only way one can profit is if they appropriate a labor value. If a laborer produces a good that the capitalist will market for $5/pc, then the full value of the good is $5. If the capitalist \"exchanges\" with the laborer the $5 good for $4, and sells the product, he profits $1. He doesn't just profit $1 because hit input was $4 and his output is $5, he profits because the laborer loses. \n\nThe laborer loses a dollar every time he or she makes this transaction (employment). That's an objective statement. You can argue that value is subjective all you want, which is fine, but the STV is just one method of explaining things. The LTV explains the same thing in combination with socially necessary labour time. Of course, it's necessary to believe that value originates from labor. It's impossible for any particular item to have value without society's labor. This isn't to say diamonds are worthless unless mined and prospected. Rather, diamonds have an average value precisely because they are usually mined and prospected, and when found, they maintain the same average value. \n\nThe solution to this is a cost-price exchange model, where all costs = all prices. Prices as determined by cost. There are a few costs involved. Material cost, and labor cost. The material cost is rather objective. If you buy X at $5, it cost you $5. The labor cost is subjective. You decide what your value is worth based on how much you value your labor, in regards to how much toil or trouble it causes you. \n\nA successful cost-price adhering hammer maker, for instance, sells his or her hammers at the price Z, where Z = X+Y. X being the objective material cost of the hammer's individual parts, packaging costs, distribution costs, etc. And Y being the subjective valuation of labor. If it causes the hammer maker a lot of trouble to produce these hammers, he or she ought to value their labor rather highly. \n\nIn addition to keeping the full value of one's labor, prices will likely be lower in the cost-price market than the value-price market. Business will be drawn to the lower priced goods and services, and labor appropriation will be a thing of the past.\n\nThat's my solution to the profits problem, at least.\n\n What's the incentive to provide the best product at the lowest price? What's the incentive to even start a business?",

While I'm against all taxation, I think progressive taxation is actually better than a fair tax.  The problem with a flat tax is that 5% of someone who earns $1,200 a month is much more painful than 5% of someone who earns $1.2 million/month.  $60/month is a lot for a poor person, $60k/month while it may seem like a lot to a rich person does not actually effect their overall lifestyle at all.  Furthermore, paying double wouldn't effect their overall lifestyle all that much.\n\nAlso, when you take into account that just about the only way that you can make $1.2 million a month is to be a part of the government subsidized economy, then it makes even more sense that they should be taxed higher since they are benefiting from the government far more than your average bloke.

I would say that right now I am in a Libertarian phase, and would much prefer the 138 page fair tax proposal to the 60,000 page tax system we currently have. But I would say that I am more in a transitional Libertarian phase with the ultimate end being anarcho-capitalism. I think that is a transition that our country will have to go through too. Not just with shifting ideology that way, but in taking down the overly inflated state, if that makes sense. If anyone has some counter argument, or can point me in the right direction, for that, I would love to hear it. But for now I think the state of the union is so sick that it has to be treated with something that slowly cures the cancer. Like it would be too much of a shock to the system to completely remove the tumor all at once. You're off by almost 25%: we're at about 73k pages for tax law now. A few years ago I did some research and determined that this amounts to some 3+ million words. That's six times the length of The Lord of the Rings. To be able to even claim you've read the US tax law, you have to read LotR six times. Then each year you have to keep up with all the editing (both additions, deletions, and changes) that happen at multiple points throughout the year. Even if that's your full-time job, that's fairly unreasonable.\n\nAs much as I wish taxes would go away, I'd much rather settle for something simple like a flat tax that applies at something like 2x poverty line and has no deductions whatsoever. Also, I think one of the best possible ways to get momentum for reducing taxes would be to end employer witholding and require that everyone pay taxes quarterly like self-employed. That would make people realize just how much is actually going to the government and would also put pressure to reduce the complexity of the tax code since it impacts people a lot more. That 60k figure came from that factcheck website. Could have been a little old. I will not lie, I have not read any of those pages. I don't have a particular source, but I pulled down the whole US code last year and did some stat analysis on it. I'd say 60k is quite conservative and several years out of date. It was officially 55k words in '03.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that the following quote exists, verbatim, on the IRS site:\n\n\n\"Finally, the IRC is complex and its sections must be read in the context of the entire Code and the court decisions that interpret it.\"\n\nSo not only is it long, but every section potentially relies on some other section. &gt;So not only is it long, but every section potentially relies on some other section.\n\nThere's a lot of cross-referencing, though in fairness there is some flow to the thing that helps it become understandable. Different chapters are different taxes (personal/income vs. estate vs. corporate, etc.), then different subsections are usually grouped so that they're by related ones. E.g., 61-100 are items specifically included in gross income, 100-131 are specifically excluded, 162-262/263 are the deduction provisions for individuals, 1000 - ~1020 are property transfers, etc.\n\nBut yeah, not only is there caselaw interpreting it to add on the pile, there are also a host of treasury regulations to go even further. And IRS Revenue Procedures, Letter Rulings, etc. too.  I'm aware of much of that (I was speaking in hyperbole) as I did some analysis and word-crunching on the code last year as a personal project. Still, there's little excuse for such a complicated system if the purpose of taxes is only to raise revenue, which many people continue to insist. Granting taxes as a necessary evil, it should be possible for the average citizen to read and understand all of the tax code that applies to him without need to hire anyone else. Anything beyond that is simply unacceptable. &gt; Still, there's little excuse for such a complicated system if the purpose of taxes is only to raise revenue, which many people continue to insist.\n\nYeah, but the people making that argument don't write or enact the damned thing.

There are also minarchist libertarians, who advocate having a small state, rather than no state. I would probably classify myself in with the minarchist-libertarian group. The State that I would like to see would be a smaller, localized government that would mainly be kept around for protective services and maybe education. Along the lines of what this thread started out about, I would like to see a flat sales tax, but much smaller than the 30% proposed by some. Maybe more along the lines of 5 or 6%, and then determining what can be done with that revenue. Eventually, I would like to see those services of the minimal State taken over by the private sector.  &gt; The State that I would like to see would be a smaller, localized government that would mainly be kept around for protective services and maybe education. \n\nIf you grant a ruling elite a monopoly on the right to initiate violence (and if we ignore the possibility of state collapse through technological change and/or economic crisis), can a ruled population realistically expect to 'keep them in check'? It seems not to have worked in the case of the US.\n\nWhy not advocate anarchy from the start? Then you get to use the best arguments ;) I would say that right now I am in a Libertarian phase, and would much prefer the 138 page fair tax proposal to the 60,000 page tax system we currently have.

Let's make someone do more of it so I don't have to.\" \n\nOne of the Theories behind the fair tax is that the amount American's pay for their government is hidden from them in a number of ways and the fair tax will help to expose how much is actually taken.  Only 50% of the Social Security tax shows up in your pay check, but 100% is taken out of your worth as a employee, for example.\n\nSo when people start to realize that the effective tax rate on USA citizens is not 15-30%, but 50-70% it will help people to realize just how wasteful government is.\n\nDue it the way consumption taxes work it really won't shift the burden around much.\n\nFair tax is something I can support if I can't get rid of all taxes period. &gt;50-70%\n     \nDo you have any math behind that you could share? Income tax: 25%.\n\nState income tax: 3%.\n\nMedicare and ss: 15%.\n\nThat's on income, 43%.\n\nNow with your 57% leftover: \n\nSales tax: 7%.\n\nNow include the income tax paid by businesses on goods they sold you. Plus any value added tax or extra special sin taxes and you get much higher.\n\nBeer in illinois, for example, the retail price is 56% made of taxes. Then consider your income is already taxed before you can buy the beer at 43% and you are looking at 75% of the money spent on beer goes to the government. \n\n WOW.  Does this work similarly in other countries?  This doesn't count black market or under the table activity though, but it also doesn't count property taxes either.   Yes other countries are similar. Many of them have \"value added tax (VAT)\" which is like 15% on each step of the process (which is what beer is taxed like in my example above). Taxes on good are usually only taken out at the retail level as sales tax.\n\nTake jeans for example:\n\n- cotton producer harvests cotton.\n\n- sells cotton to jean manufacturer and pays a 15% VAT.  \n\n- jean manufacturer uses cotton to make jeans (adds value to the resource and marks up the price to profit). Sells jeans to clothing wholesaler and pays 15% VAT. \n\n- wholesaler marks up jeans and sells jeans to retailer and pays 15% VAT.\n\n- retailer sells the jeans and the tax paid is built in to the retail price.\n\nThe math is not straightforward, but it is a considerable amount.\n Thank you very much for answering his question.\n\nI'd also like to point out, on a side note, that taxes do not reflect the entire cost of government. Regulation and compliance costs money. \n\nGoing back to the beer example... in addition to you getting 'double taxed' on beer by having your income tax + sales tax + various taxes the beer stores and brewers have to pay there is quite a bit of regulatory overhead. The stores have laws they have to comply with. Licensing, inspection, and lots of paperwork is involved. This costs time and money. The brewery has to have similar compliance costs it has to deal with. Inspections, unions, and whatever else it has to deal with. Lots of licensing, paper work, tax accounting etc etc. Then you have regulations over the truck drivers that deliver the raw materials necessary to the brewery. If the hops and spices need to be imported from other counties then you have tarrifs and other import restrictions. etc etc etc.\n\nThen if you buy the beer at a bar then that is a whole new set of terrible laws and such.\n\nAll this stuff adds up.  If you combine taxation with regulatory overhead... it's impossible to know for certain, but you are looking at close to 90% of economic activity with beer is consumed by government overhead. \n\nI always had the visualization that government is a 90 pound leach attached to the neck of a 160 pound man, that man being the 'private sector'. It is still a mystery to many people why people like us would equate economic depression with big government and not lack of regulations... &gt; \"God, this whole paying the government thing really sucks.

What has always baffled me is that they'll claim to want to help those who are less fortunate, but often times they're less likely to do so themselves.  I've read studies in the past which take the left/right approach to politics and looked to see how those groups approach altruism.  While those who are 'conservative' on average earned less, they donated more money and time to charity.  They also donated more blood.  While some of this can be attributed to 'conservatives' being more religious and their church donations counting as charity, there's a lot of evidence for this to be true outside of the religious aspect of it.  \n\nIf you ask someone who is pro-taxation if they had $500, and they wanted to help someone less fortunate, how would they spend it... 99 times out of 100 you won't hear them tell you they would donate it to the state.  They will take about some charity, or directly helping someone they know in need.  They recognize the futility of giving money to the state and expecting results when it comes to their money, but when it comes to yours, they're glad to do it.\n\nWhich reminds me of Milton Friedman's 4 ways to spend money.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RDMdc5r5z8 I think liberals aren't necessarily huge fans of the State. Sure, they love the entitlement programs and all the \"good\" stuff they like to imagine the government does, but then at the same time they see that a big State means more of the stuff they don't like too. Like less freedom and a ridiculous military budget. Mostly the whole tax thing, I think, is about the \"evil corporations\" and the rich. Its all about redistribution of wealth. That's just my thoughts.  I think it's intellectually dishonest.  They don't want their money to fund foreign wars, neither do I.  But instead of recognizing the system is broken, they're glad to spend my money via taxation.    Which Friedman? Milton or David? Sorry, I was talking about David. He's one of my favorites. Good choice!    Friedman says great things, but I will never forget that he invented the income tax withholding.  ",

    "title" : "Question about morality in An-Cap society.",
    "snippet" : "A lot of people, including myself believe that the governmental system of a country is a reflection of the majorities moral compass. I think we all can agree that many, if not most people are immoral and ignorant.\n\nMy question is: if the morality of the people in the United States is not sound, how could an immediate (hypothetical) transition to a voluntarist/anarchist society work?\n\nEdit: grammar   Take the few people who aren't assholes, put them in one place, use agorism to ignore the State. Presto! Anarchy. Warning: Bitcoin/other encrypted currency required. \n\nEdit: which brings up a good point. These people don't need to be geographically close. Just need a computer and a currency that cannot be taxed or tracked by the government.  Eventually they will need transportation of goods that are not subject to state intervention, and safe places to conduct business in meatspace.  Not all of life can be lived on the internet. Eventually they will need transportation of goods that are not subject to state intervention, and safe places to conduct business in meatspace.  Not all of life can be lived on the internet. In time additive manufacturing (\"3D printing\") will cover a subset of goods that currently require transport. You wouldn't have to own the printer yourself if there's a nearby company providing print-on-demand (Staples is doing this on a limited scale right now).\n\nAnyone for a batch of high-cap magazines? ;-) You can print many things, but not all things.  3D printing will almost certainly never completely replace other production models.  The most popular examples of things printing can not solve for many agorists are plant materials or chemical in nature. That's why I said it'd be a subset. But thinking of chemicals and plant materials, there are on-the-horizon technologies that can broaden what on-demand manufacturing and synthesis can do.\n\nOne is the development of artificial genomes (J Craig Venter Institute's Mycoplasma mycoides, the first PoC of what they're looking to call _Mycoplasma laboratorium_) which in turn mean the possibility of microfactories that can synthesize complex substances. You download the genes that synthesize what you want, then use a DNA synthesizer to produce the genome or plasmid, a transduction process sticks it in a suitable prokaryote (plasmids of DNA are relatively easy to transduct because they don't have to be integrated with an existing chromosome), and then grow them in a vat of nutrients. Purify the result and you're done. Much of that can be automated.\n\nIndeed, you can download free software to manipulate genomes right now, plus there are companies that will synthesize the DNA for you relatively cheaply (see http://www.blueheronbio.com). \n\n(Hilariously, these are some of the few companies that use _Real_ Antivirus Software--I mean, they scan for the signatures of things like _ebola_, not Win32.Conficker.B.) I am not sure you know what is meant by *on the horizon*.  To do those things today requires rooms of equipment and very highly technically trained operation, and its still not all possible.  While it might make it into small comercial turn-key style devices I do not think anyone presumes it is advancing with something like a Moore's rate law condition.  Also, anyone who tells you they can scan for ebola and give you a cure is lying to you (at least currently). I don't mean they're providing a _cure_ for ebola, I mean companies like Blue Heron are using virus scanners to prevent terrorists from tricking them into synthesizing it, or smallpox, or anything else nasty. They scan for the signatures of those viruses in anything you upload to be synthesized.\n\nAnd as for what requires \"rooms of equipment\", you'd be surprised. There are a number of \"bio hackerspaces\" that are popping up, such as biocurious.org, diybio.org and others, where all of the lab equipment is community owned. The \"Hello World\" of bio hacking is splicing the GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) of a jellyfish into bacteria. High-school students are doing it. \n\n**Edit:** The proof-of-concept for viral synthesis was done a few years ago at Stony Brook University in New York. A professor downloaded the genome for _polio_ off the Internet, then used one of those mail-order DNA synthesis companies to turn it into chains of nucleotides. After a bit of assembly in the lab, they infected a mouse with it, and the mouse got sick with polio. A lot of critics called this a prank, but it's mindblowing all the same. &gt;I mean companies like Blue Heron are using virus scanners to prevent terrorists from tricking them into synthesizing it, or smallpox, or anything else nasty. They scan for the signatures of those viruses in anything you upload to be synthesized.\n\nIf by 'scan' you mean they look in their dictionary, then sure.\n\n&gt;And as for what requires \"rooms of equipment\", you'd be surprised.\n\nNot really, my lab-mates routinely do gene expression.  I know exactly what goes into it.  I don't think an immediate transition would work, it'd probably be more successful if there were a few generations of gradual cultural change in advance of the day when the state was scrapped.\n\nAnd not just cultural change, but islands--both physical and virtual--of voluntarism that provide a kind of \"anarchist college\" where people practice and build a functional understanding of how things would then work. Let's say you do create these isolated 'communities' of voluntarism, what if the government decides they dont like the idea of you opting-out of the social contract. How do you protect yourself against an entity with F-16's and drones? I think this is what agorism is meant to address when it comes to virtual islands. Silk Road uses anonymizing technology (TOR, BitCoin) to hide both the location of the servers, the identity of its users, and the money trail. (The anonymous delivery of goods is a bit tricky, but there are now a number of companies offering automated mailbox kiosks in shopping malls and convenience stores--ostensibly for people who won't be at home when the delivery is made. I've forgotten the name of one that's operating in Canada right now.)\n\nPhysical islands would only avoid a military challenge if they didn't do anything that annoyed the state enough to take action, or if taking action was more trouble than it was worth. Therefore a \"tame\" libertarian island might survive, but would still be enough for people to practice the basics of AnCap society.\n\nThe technologically founded marketplaces are vulnerable to attacks on the protocols and ciphers they use, as well as \"big data\" attacks (data mining to discover hubs and users), which a state has the resources to attempt. The theoretical capabilities of a working quantum computer would foil ciphers based on the difficulty of prime factorization, for example. Perhaps elliptic curve cryptography would hold up better. What if the dissenters were pulling a large about of revenue away from the state by shifting the means of production to the islands? \n\nExample: say Alaska becomes a stateless society, and manufacturers in the U.S. decide to move their factories to Alaska? And people buy goods from Alaska because in a stateless society there are no taxes.\n\nCould the government of the U.S. impose tariffs even if Alaska is stateless? And if people in Alaska decide not to participate, what's stopping the state from invading with force?          ",

    "snippet" : "I'm 14 and I have been trying to spread anarcho-capitalism through assignments in my school. I spread it to teachers through written assignments and to my peers through class presentations.\n\nI've noticed that lots of people my age will acknowledge that war is mass murder, taxation is theft, and lots believe that conscription is slavery. The kids that are considered \"average\" or \"stupid\" are far less statist than those considered \"intelligent\". Today I presented a project in which I quoted Rothbard's excellent summary of statism, \n\n\"For centuries the State has committed mass murder and called it “war”; then ennobled the mass slaughter that “war” involves. For centuries the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions and called it “conscription” in the “national service.” For centuries the State has robbed people at bayonet point and called it “taxation.” The State has cloaked its criminal activity in high-sounding rhetoric.\"\n\nI expected to be bombarded with cries that taxation is not theft, but I was surprised. I could tell that even the hardcore statists could not argue this. \n\nTeachers, on the other hand, are more convinced that statism is a moral system. But for them too, I could see that they were very disturbed by this reality. \n\nSadly, most people do not apply this reality to their political views. If they agree that taxation is theft and that theft is morally wrong, they can't seem to apply that to statist policies that rely on taxation. It's like they are missing a link. They can't connect, for example, the drug war with taxation. They can't see that supporting government healthcare is supporting taxation, which is theft. They can't understand that regulations are enforced by the gun of the state, but they will agree that pointing guns at people is wrong.\n\nAnyway, the point is, be hopeful. Kids aren't so stupid. They can see the truth that most adults have chosen to ignore.  My observation: Kids raised on South Park have a tendency to be libertarians.

Those answers were anarcho-capitalist ones. :) Where are all these young kids coming from?! I'm only 20, but 14? You are awesome.   Thats an interesting observation.\n\nIn reality, we all start off leaning AnCap as children. Most parents rules for 3 year-old's are very similar to the NAP.

I mean, for kids, toy theft is a pretty good example, but in the real adult world, there's also some pretty dark stuff, like rape. All of which violate the NAP to varying degrees of seriousness.\n\nSo how do you deal with aggression without some sort of counterforce? Even subduing the aggressor as peacefully as possible and primarily enacting punishment by people voluntarily refusing to serve the aggressor, is still punishment in a wider sense. I also believe that while humans are much less in need of micromanagement than statists think, there's still gonna be some bad apple subset of the population that won't respond to anything but threats and isolation/containment.\n\nI'm not trying to dog on your proposal, I wanna be clear about that. I just want to know what your proposal *is,* since I can't extrapolate anything that seems sensible to me out of such a small comment. NAP does not imply pacifism.  Sorry for the other poster for making a snarky and sarcastic comment.  The NAP is about not initiating aggression, but obviously you can \"aggress\" in self-defense.\n\n&gt; I also believe that while humans are much less in need of micromanagement than statists think, there's still gonna be some bad apple subset of the population that won't respond to anything but threats and isolation/containment.\n\nI think we'd all fully agree with this.  This is kind of how you know our ideas are not utopic.  There will be people of questionable character that will do horrific acts, but the incentive to not do horrific acts will be so high that I think you would see less and less occur over time.  Remember, lawlessness works in both ways.  You think it's risky to live in a world without cops?  Imagine trying to initiate aggression in a world without cops.  It's for more risky because everyone takes responsibility of protection upon themselves rather than ceding that responsibility to men in costumes.  A lot of bad apples will get weeded out very quickly.\n\nAlso, there are more advanced proposed systems of an ancapism where there are much more nuanced ways of dealing with these people.   However, it all seems so theoretical that to me it almost feels intellectually dishonest to claim that this is how it will be solved. Well put!\n\nThis is kind of what I was looking for in the first place - everyone seems to think I'm tripped up on the NAP, but that's just 'cause of poor wording on my part - and this is an honest answer to that question.\n\nSo, to verify that I've got this right, there *is* a threat of punishment for initiating aggression, but this is delegated to individuals' self-defense and private security instead of a centralized police force, and after the would-be initiator is subdued, things are handed over to the free market justice system. At least, in the prevailing/general theory, not counting the proposed systems you mentioned. Correct? &gt; there is a threat of punishment for initiating aggression\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; this is delegated to individuals' self-defense and private security instead of a centralized police force\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; and after the would-be initiator is subdued, things are handed over to the free market justice system\n\nIt can be handed over to the free market justice system before the aggressor is \"subdued\". The finding, subduing and punishing of the aggressor are all marketable tasks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o\n\nEDIT: I personally think that libertarians have a romanticized image of self defense and violence. I dont think for a second that a free society would allow personal vendettas and taking the law into your own hands to anywhere near the same extent as many libertarians seem to think. In fact, its highly likely that society would find such behaviour to be criminal itself, just like it is today. Why do i need another to defend my rights? Why can't i take the law into my own hands? Sure, i may have to justify my actions later, but if i act within the law what is the problem? Society will not tolerate anyone running around having vendettas and shootouts, even if the people engaging in them can \"justify them later\". Such behaviour will itself be considered criminal, and professional organizations and agents will be employed to deal with it. Employed by who? Okay, honest discussion time - the NAP is great, and I agree with it 100%, but how do you deal with people who commit acts of aggression?

I just want to know what your proposal *is,* since I can't extrapolate anything that seems sensible to me out of such a small comment. NAP != Pacifism. Read up. That's... not really a helpful answer. To any of the possible questions I was asking. No offense. Apologies, I see now that it wasnt the most polite or helpful answer.\n\nThe NAP deals with \"initiation of aggression\", not \"aggression\". The distinction is extremely important. If you initiate aggression against me, under the NAP Im allowed to defend myself using whatever force necessary. (Unlike pacifism which allows no force to be employed ever no matter what)\n\nA lot of people then make ridiculous hasty conclusions saying that the NAP allows shooting a child who comes to pick up a ball on your property. Clearly that is not the case and there is no society which would ever tolerate such behaviour, libertarian, anarchist or otherwise. (unless the child points a gun at you or whatever)\n\nAs for exactly where the line goes is up to society to decide, preferably through the free market for justice. That makes a lot of sense, I agree completely. Honestly, I wasn't trying to endorse pacifism, or set it up as a strawman to punch in the face, but I can totally see why it reads that way because I skimped on a few words. So we're on the same page there.\n\nI'm still not solid on the answer to the question I was looking for in the first place - law enforcement without any sort or threat of punishment - but I still have a lot of unread messages to go through in my inbox, and I suspect someone's spelled it out for me already. Its not possible to have law enforcement without any sort of threat of punishment. The NAP and free societies allow punishment and threats of punishment against aggressors. The task of finding, subduing and punishing aggressors will be delegated to enforcement organizations who compete with each other on a free market.\n\nThat said, because physically punishing people is messy, expensive and ineffective, it is thought that free societies will rely more on ostracization and other non-violent means of punishment than what is the case today. E.g. if you are found guilty of some crime, your insurance company may drop coverage for you, your bank may close your account, your landlord may throw you out etc.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o That's what I thought, which is why I asked in the first place. The implication that you can run a society without some sort of law enforcement and justice system, or that you can have those without some mechanism of legal punishment, seemed confusingly utopian. That's... not really a helpful answer. To any of the possible questions I was asking. No offense. That's... not really a helpful answer. To any of the possible questions I was asking. No offense.

I'm a 16 year old at an ultra-conservative Christian school. It's really tough to spread our message: they've certainly ennoblized the wars and venerate Reagan as a saint. But it's good to hear about somebody in the same boat. Friendly suggestion: once you graduate, talk to your teachers about coming back and doing a presentation or two on politics/economics. This is especially good if you get along well with your history/government teacher. I've done this a couple times now (I went to a small conservative xian school as well) and it's been very well received. The teachers love seeing students continue learning outside of school so I'd bet they'd be more than willing to let you speak just from gratitude that you haven't forgotten everything they ever told you lol  16 here. I'm awfully proud of my school for this. When we had a mock election in our school, all of my friends voted for Gary Johnson. In the end,  Barack Obama (predictably) won, but here's the catch: Gary Johnson won in grade 12, the only grade that actually takes a US Gov/Pol class. Most of the Obama votes were from 6th-graders who did it because it seemed like the \"cool\" thing to do. And Romney won in none of the grades (and that's saying something; my school is in a relatively Republican area of MA). Beats the mock election we had when I was in 8th grade at least. The (Swedish) nazi party won, the school refused to make the results public and we all had to sit through a bunch of lectures on how immigrants are people too.

I've noticed older generations of Americans who didn't have access to the free exchange of ideas via the Internet care more about short-term results rather than the ideas behind them and the consequences of these ideas, and that contributes also to this trend going largely unnoticed. \n\nIn short, we are coming to a crisis of both finances and identity in the West.

Yeah, I'm 28, and I find this to be true among my friends. Prior to the election, I threw up some stuff on Facebook about Gary Johnson - I discovered that many friends had libertarian/an-cap leanings, in the process. The people who argued with me the most were either older (like my parents), or else in the military.\n\nSadly, I'm pretty sure a rift formed between myself and my sister at that time. Her husband is in the air force, and they both advocate extreme preemptive violence against people they consider our enemies. They believe America should be spending *more* in the military, not less. And they believe that we should be expanding our military bases and influence over seas to protect our interests and help combat the continuing threat of communism (China/Russia) and terrorism (Middle East).\n\nThose conversations did not go well, at all...  This thread makes me feel old, I just turned 30.\n\nThough, it also makes me hopeful. While I've always had anarchist and libertarian leanings since as long as I can remember, I didn't begin to self-identify as An-Cap until a few years ago. It is nice to see that libertarianism as a philosophy is not lost on the younger generation as it seems to be among my own.   You are epic, dude (or dudette).  Relevant user name.

I would try to relax a little. There's nothing at all wrong with trying to enlighten people, but schools tend to be something like government prisons, and young people often don't have very open minds. They have the opinions they've been fed and hey, they're busy and confused a lot. They are just becoming adults.\n\nGo for it, enjoy, have the strength of your convictions. It's good practice anyway.

There are a few other libertarians I know that I enjoy discussing things with, but most people (down here in TX) are really quick to praise Reagan and Bush.

They are weak-spirited people, incapable of following their own will, and as such seek validation from their peers, who are in turn seeking validation from them, and they all just become one big, wandering herd, stroking its own ego. The herd does not like people like you. You force them to think, to step out of their comfort zone. They will do everything they can to assimilate you, it's their instinct. I wasted much of high school trying to impress the herd. Don't waste your time. Follow your own will, and show others how to do the same.  I disagree that taxation is theft. The majority thinks it's a good idea to pay for city management, construction, police. If they didn't they could vote those things away.

    "title" : "How a \"Libertarian\" Capitalist Became a Libertarian Socialist",
    "snippet" : "  I really don't see how someone could simultaneously understand Georgism but think this...\n\n&gt;Jones is a individual who has zero access to capital, which excludes him from being self-employed. He must must find somebody who will share access to capital if he is to continue to eat.\n\nYou either have access to land with which you can mix your labor to produce food and capital, or you have been compensated for that exclusion by land-owners. Jones presumably doesn't live under a system of Georgism.  If he did, he probably wouldn't be in the situation he is. Right.\n\nI just don't get how the guy recognized the problem of land enclosure and went to Georgism, then later... re-recognized the problem and decided to turn against capital. Georgism was a way to preserve capitalism, while avoiding the problems of land enclosure.  Later, the author comes to understand how the organization of labor in capitalism conflicts with his fundamental principles of personal liberty.  Since his libertarianism is founded on moral principles, any 'libertarian' system that produced results contrary to the fundamental moral principles must be rejected.\n\nI think his story accurately describes a gradual, thoughtful exploration and investigation of libertarian principles. Like many young libertarians, he started as a right-libertarian, having just read Ayn Rand.  This requisite introduction was shortly followed by the oft-recommended intermediate course of Mises, Nozick, Hayek, and Friedman.  This only affirmed his current beliefs.  As he experienced the world, and thought more about the nature of property, he came to reconsider his position on capitalism. Well put, and I guess I just can't see past my own perspective here.\n\nWhen he says \"access to capital excludes 'Jones' from being self-employed\", I see the same insight that led me to Georgism.  I realized that the \"voluntary\" nature of employment represents a false choice if some other person's use of capital (in the neo-economic sense) impedes his opportunities.  The Georgist distinction between land and capital resolved this problem for me.  Thus, it is really weird for me to see a guy who went Georgist, then was swayed to \"socialism\" by the same thing that brought me to Georgism.  \n\n    &gt; that land is not a produced good\n\nCould someone elaborate on this?\n\nThe land itself may not be a produced good however what people are willing to pay for it is based on whats around the land. Things like utilities, roads, other people, services, some kind of legal system, amusement parks, etc. which all required production through labor.\n\nIsn't some, if not most, of what people are willing to pay for a piece of \"un-produced\" land based on the time and effort people put into the land around it?\n I recommend [this](http://discoursesonliberty.blogspot.com/2011/10/images-of-freedom-georgist-political.html) brief article.  It covers the basic idea.    Interesting read. This is why I like asking for help in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism.\n\na) There seem to be some strange assumption that population will always increase[1]. \n\nb) This document states that land owners can't push tax costs onto renters. I thought that changes in costs were shared by the producer and the consumer (from Economics 101).\n\nc) The document seems to imply that buying un-produced land and waiting for the value to go up through the labor of those around them is always a positive gain (no risk to the land owner). However, I think there have been many cases where just such speculation has lead to a loss to the land owner and thus a gain for the renter.\n\nand so on...\n\n[1] If population eventually levelled out, then does it matter if the amount of land is fixed? If population continued to increase, then there will be a lot greater strains on society than people having to \"pay rent\" to live on the Earth. a) Yes, there is an assumption about constant population increase.  It is not essential though.  If land becomes increasingly consolidated, the same problem exists for stagnant or even shrinking populations.  Additionally, if capital is increasing (even if population [or labor] is not) the potential yield from land increases and thus so does land value.\n\nI don't really agree with the footnote though.  The \"Malthusian trap\" has largely proven incorrect.  It is true that mouths increase exponentially while land stays stagnant.  However, along with those mouths come hands and minds.  History has proven that the output of those hands and minds increases the *yield* of land through capital and technology at a rate that greatly outpaces the mouths that come with it.\n\nb) see [here](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/janusg/hgf/pass.htm) for a very brief explanation of this.  Henry George's argument can be read [here](http://www.wealthandwant.com/HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html).\n\nc)  Yes.  I tend to agree with you.  However, assuming that either the population or the efficiency of yield from land (basically assuming progress by any definition), land values will ultimately rise.  People will still go bankrupt speculating on land because they do not have the reserves to weather short-term fluctuations.  This is actually one of the main ways in which wealthy interests agglomerate land in the current system.  They can hold land through the swings, and then accrue more land immediately following a crash.\n\nGeorge actually used land speculation to describe the business cycle back in 1890, in a way that is shockingly familiar to anyone witnessing the events leading up to the recent recession.  Geolibertarian Fred Foldvary actually called the recent recession (to the year) back in the 90s.  [Here](http://www.foldvary.net/works/geoaus.html) is an article on his Geo-Austrian synthesis of the business cycle.  Or.. probably more fun is [this little graphical presentation](http://workandwealth.com/boom-bust-economic-cycles-land-cycles/) of the relationship between land and the business cycle.  \n\nFinally.. I should note that *yes* there is risk in land speculation.  However, there isn't production.  Speculation in capital draws money to possibly fruitful ventures and helps get them off the ground, or helps draw money away from less efficient established businesses and into more efficient startups.  Capital speculation makes the world better for more than just the speculator.  Since land by definition cannot be produced, speculation in land produces nothing but allows the speculator to claim the value of the land that he did not produce.   The line that probably sticks out the most to me is: \"Principles always came *first* for me -- not economics.\" I cannot say that I didn't come in through Ayn Rand and all of that, but I more or less stay in because of my economic beliefs...I kinda wanted to lean more towards left libertarianism. I have a lot of heart towards many possible company-structures, and don't think of entrepreneurs as heroes or anything...\n\nAnywho, I've never worked for a large company, only smaller ones. I have never seen a reason to believe these would be particularly flexible in a lot of ways because regardless of how much state privilege a specific company has gotten, anti-competitiveness is pervasive in the economy as a whole. With very little ability to restructure a company and with a huge amount of danger in changing many things that are working, companies with little capital cannot do much and companies with a bunch wouldn't want to. \n\nAlthough the internet may operate by more free market principles as a whole, it does not completely, between IP, limited liability, and the fact that the companies still have to abide by the same kinds of laws as other business models (capital requirements and zoning laws are two biggies that come to mind that are not the same), I don't see why there would be too big a difference as far as their operations go. \n\nI was also never under the impression that companies worked for the good of all, though I do believe many inventors, workers and owners believe that are contributing to the improvement of peoples' lives.

I have never seen a reason to believe these would be particularly flexible in a lot of ways because regardless of how much state privilege a specific company has gotten, anti-competitiveness is pervasive in the economy as a whole. With very little ability to restructure a company and with a huge amount of danger in changing many things that are working, companies with little capital cannot do much and companies with a bunch wouldn't want to. \n\nAlthough the internet may operate by more free market principles as a whole, it does not completely, between IP, limited liability, and the fact that the companies still have to abide by the same kinds of laws as other business models (capital requirements and zoning laws are two biggies that come to mind that are not the same), I don't see why there would be too big a difference as far as their operations go. \n\nI was also never under the impression that companies worked for the good of all, though I do believe many inventors, workers and owners believe that are contributing to the improvement of peoples' lives.

Or are you saying that spanking only works on children, as they cant fight back? You seem to assume spanking is simply a power trip.  You only do it to weaker, smaller, helpless people/children who cant run or hide, or have a choice. \n\n\nI am sure you would find it easier than \"correcting\" your own size of people.\n\nAm I right?\n Right minded adults have no guardian.  And right minded adults spank their own helpless kids, but nobody their own size? Spanking to correct behavior. Right minded adults, with no proper guardians, have no need of that and no one permitted to do it anyway.   &gt;&gt;He also notes that for some adults, it's impossible to blame their own parents for spanking because it would mean that they were somehow scarred by being spanked. Instead, they believe that they \"deserved\" what they got.\n\n\n\nHow many in r/ancap feel like this? /r/ancap is fairly split on this issue. Some people are all for the peaceful parenting, no spanking ideas, and others view it as a necessary component of parenting. /u/throwaway-o dramatically abandoned the subreddit in the Great Spanking Debacle of May 2012, in part because of the mixed attitudes towards spanking expressed on this subreddit.

I don't understand your strategy. It seems like you want to identify the \"damaged\" people so you can call them out as such in the future. Wouldn't it be better to simply treat them with respect and try to foster mutual understanding and *healing* of those wounds? When a patient walks into the emergency room, the doctor doesn't just point and say \"Hey everyone, this guy's wounded!\" Instead he *treats* the wound so that the patient ends up healthier as a result.\n\nI would love to see you take a palliative or even curative approach to the people you believe are damaged. Demonizing them does no one any favors. &gt; Wouldn't it be better to simply treat them with respect and try to foster mutual understanding and healing of those wounds?\n\n\nPeople who are for beating the weakest people they can get away with deserve nothing more than complete ostracism.

There are over 90% of people who have been spanked, and a lot of them don't continue the cycle after learning the facts of violence.\n\nHere when have a rational sub that deals with non aggression, and there are  baby beaters. \n\n\n&gt; I would love to see you take a palliative or even curative approach to the people you believe are damaged. \n\nMe too, but what happens instead? Oh you follow moly, oh if i dont like you i must be abused, cult, not correlation, therapists dont know, therapists are authority ect ect. \n\n\n&gt; Demonizing them does no one any favors.\n\nA lot of people have that problem. Wounded is not a label as stupid, evil, bad. And I think that has caused a lot of people to think of me as a \"troll\", but simply saying you got herpes when your mouth is full of cold sores, and they call me \"evil for calling him a slut\"\n\n &gt;deserve \n\nWhat does this word mean? What result will you accomplish by ostracizing these people?\n\n&gt;Oh you follow moly, oh if i dont like you i must be abused, cult, not correlation, therapists dont know, therapists are authority ect ect.\n\nI'm not suggesting you try to convince everyone that spanking is bad. There's certainly a time and a place for that discussion, and I think it's a really important one to have.\n\nHowever, what I'm talking about is simply engaging with others in a *constructive* manner, and when that is not possible, *refrain from interaction*. I've seen you post many many non-constructive comments, and I just don't see the point of them. I'm sure the people you were talking to are much more keenly aware of your distaste for them and their apparent approval of spanking. So what? You mostly just manage to make an enemy. Better to say nothing at all, right?\n\n&gt;Wounded is not a label as stupid, evil, bad. \n\nThat may be true, and you may even be correct in identifying someone as wounded. So what? What are you trying to accomplish by saying so? The people I see you talk to just seem irritated by your comments; I don't see them being pushed to the edge of a psychological breakdown that will free them from the memory of their child abuse. I don't see them coming to an anti-child abuse realization. I just see irritation at you, and more people gaining a dislike for you.\n\nIt's awfully difficult to change someone's mind if they don't have a high opinion of you. Sometimes it's necessary to cater to what the other person needs from a conversation, in order to build up some trust and foster honest assessment of your ideas. I see you breaking down that line of communication, not building it up. I think you could do better.      *A mission statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) describes it as \"striking a child with an open hand on the buttocks or extremities with the intention of modifying behavior without causing physical injury.\"*\n\n\n\nI think the *without causing physical injury*, is redundant, anybody disagrees?  What do you mean?  If you are modifying behaviour through force, pain/injury is already included.  Spanking causes zero physical injury, like bruises, cuts, an broken bones. It only causes some temporary pain, which is not an injury.  &gt; It only causes some temporary pain, which is not an injury.\n\n\nSo why cant we just cause \"temporary pain\" for better on elderly, retards, paraplegics, husband/wife, clercks, bad taxi drivers ect?\n\n\nedit: water boarding and getting punched over a phone book wont injure you either. It's the responsibility of guardians to aid you, even if they must act against some of your own wishes.  ",

    "snippet" : "This is an honest question that I would love to have a civil debate about. :)  Small States do not stay small. Somewhere, someone, is going to write a book on the OP's question, and the tl;dr of that book will be 1Subject's comment.\n\nI do not spend time arguing with Libertarians (I am an LP member) that they are wrong.  Rather, I simply wait for them to sourly conclude the obvious: A Constitutional Republic such as that we have in the USA was supposed to be something like \"limited government,\" in other words, something like minarchy.\n\nAnd look what happened.\n\nThere is no subtlety to this argument.  There are no details.  There is only history, littered with examples of 1Subject's assertation. To be fair, what happened was a violent and bloody war of aggression by the Federal Government in the late 1800s that completely overturned the government instituted prior. Small States do not stay small.  The standard problems with all types of monopolies.  Reduction in quality of service and an increase in price. Except in reality those are not things that occur with monopolies. What do you mean? Look at when there were actual monopolies (e.g. Standard Oil) and you'll see that prices were incredibly low compared to the prices shortly after breaking them up. I don't consider Standard Oil a monopoly.  They had competition and the threat of competition.  Monopolies must be maintained through force. So you reject our reality and replace it with your own? So you reject our reality and replace it with your own? Let's look at the evidence and see who is rejecting reality, shall we?\n\nPeak market share for Standard Oil was achieved in 1904, with them having 91% of production and 85% of final sales.  91% and 85% are not 100%, do you agree?  Market interventionists argue that this is when SO's \"monopolistic\" practices would have gotten them the biggest edge and they would dominated any competitor that tried to enter the market. Yet by 1911, when SO was broken up, it only had 64% of the market and there were 147 companies in competition. So, to conclude, 91%, 85%, and 64% do not equal 100%, and 147 doesn't equal 0.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil) Let's look at transportation and availability in the early 1900s and not pretend that it was the same as 2013.\n\nIn almost every area that any oil was available they were the only supplier. &gt;In almost every area that any oil was available they were the only supplier.\n\nThis is simply not true, but even if I grant that it is, they still had to face the specter of competition.  People that lived in the areas that had reasonable prices would simply buy and transport the oil to the places that had outrageous prices and make a nice profit.  If the cost to do so negated that profit then the prices in the \"uncompetitive area\" aren't that outrageous (and when you factor in the cost of transport are reasonable).\n\nYou acknowledge that prices declined in this era, why would SO oil do this if they had a monopoly?  It doesn't make any sense.   A state (small or otherwise) has:  A monopoly on force.  A monopoly on arbitration. A fiat currency with a central bank (usually).\n\nVoluntarism does not require any of those.  Simply, a minarchist government is still a criminal gang that you have no choice but to pay for protection (or else), and that is not ethical. Not to sound rude, but you don't want to pay for protection? Where would you get protection if it *weren't* the government? Is there any examples of private security companies working? Private security seems to work just fine.  What do you think bodyguards are, or mall cops?  There are already private para-military companies as well.  By making security private you make it accountable. Not to sound rude, but you don't want to pay for protection? Where would you get protection if it *weren't* the government? Is there any examples of private security companies working? Of course I do. Probably AD&amp;T.  A state (small or otherwise) has:  A monopoly on force.  A monopoly on arbitration. A fiat currency with a central bank (usually).\n\nVoluntarism does not require any of those.  Simply, a minarchist government is still a criminal gang that you have no choice but to pay for protection (or else), and that is not ethical. One correction. The \"state has a monopoly on force\" is a kind of misnomer. It's more accurate to say that it has a monopoly on dictating what kind of force is allowed and who may use it. The idea that it has final arbitration means it does in effect have a monopoly on force. From where is this monopoly granted? Ideally from the consent of the governed.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, they think that when you have 5 people and 3 people get together and vote to rob the other 2, that this is acceptable.  It is not. So the governed grants monopolies? The government and its acolytes say the governed have granted it its monopoly. Thing is, they were never offered the option *not to*. If they try to withdraw their support, they'll be risking being subject to violence by the state. So, this can hardly be considered consensual. The government and its acolytes say the governed have granted it its monopoly. Thing is, they were never offered the option *not to*. If they try to withdraw their support, they'll be risking being subject to violence by the state. So, this can hardly be considered consensual. So the government grants the monopoly to itself? If your idea of \"granting\" something implies legitimacy, then no, the government doesn't \"grant\" itself the monopoly, it imposes it at gunpoint.\n\nIf there's no legitimacy claim implied, then, yes, one can say the government grants the monopoly to itself. If we remember it was not its to grant in the first place. One correction. The \"state has a monopoly on force\" is a kind of misnomer. It's more accurate to say that it has a monopoly on dictating what kind of force is allowed and who may use it.  The violence inherent in the State. No matter the size, it is paid through taxes, and taxes are involuntary.\n\nThe fact that it retains a monopoly on law and the legality of the use of force.\n\nThe fact that the State will always grow.\n\nThe fact that it can only rule through force and coercion.\n\nI liken the State to Kudzu. It's an invasive weed that chokes everything it covers. Cutting it back will only reset the growth. You must completely get rid of it in order for the other growth to be allowed to flourish. &gt; The fact that the State will always grow.\n\nHow is this a fact? A cursory observation of history proves this. The founders of the United States attempted to create the smallest imaginable government, and tried to craft a document that would prevent its growth. In a little over 2 centuries the United States stands as the largest most imperial state in the history of the world. You just gave me empirical evidence showing U.S. growth in history. I'm looking for the backing to the \"factual\" statement that a state will *always* grow. &gt; The fact that the State will always grow.\n\nHow is this a fact? The violence inherent in the State. No matter the size, it is paid through taxes, and taxes are involuntary.\n\nThe fact that it retains a monopoly on law and the legality of the use of force.\n\nThe fact that the State will always grow.\n\nThe fact that it can only rule through force and coercion.\n\nI liken the State to Kudzu. It's an invasive weed that chokes everything it covers. Cutting it back will only reset the growth. You must completely get rid of it in order for the other growth to be allowed to flourish. Not all forms of minarchy are funded by coercive taxation.  Please explain how this could be. Not LiberTed, but I'll give it a shot:\n\nI've heard people describe some form of ultraminimal state which maintains final jurisdiction over legal proceedings and is funded entirely by fees exacted from parties found guilty. I guess depending on your definition, you could say that's not taxes (though it would be coercion, just \"justified\" coercion).\n\nGeolibertarianism would similarly argue that since no person can actually own the raw value of the land that the land use taxes are then not coercive (or at least not aggressive) since to deny the community their common stake in the land would itself be aggression. So I guess you could say that these are at least non-aggressive taxes (if you accept this form of common ownership, obviously), which would be consistent with the NAP.\n\nThat's the best I can think of, and both completely depend on perspective. Maybe LiberTed can enlighten us as to what specifically he's referencing, though. I'm genuinely curious. But most people who claim to be minarchists definitely don't go out of their way to provide a framework for how such a system could function without aggressive funding.\n\nOf course, my position has always been that if we all rally around minarchy and ever get even reasonably close then we can finally start drawing the battle lines between the two groups. I'd love if we ever got to such a point that it was minarchist vs anarchist in public debate, but I'm skeptical I'll live to see such a day... &gt; Geolibertarianism would similarly argue that since no person can actually own the raw value of the land that the land use taxes are then not coercive\n\nI've never understood this one. Since no one can own land, there should be a single elite group (\"government\") that can forcefully collect fees for land use? Please explain how this could be. Let us say that a number of people voluntarily agree to erect a state and this state cannot initiate force against anyone, do you not think that these people gladly would donate to such an institution?\n\nOther ways of revenue could be, for example, fees for ensuring contracts and backing them up with the threat of retaliatory force if they break the contract.  So far it seems you're describing a business. Would this state get all of its property from voluntary donations, or would it try to \"inherit\" the property of a past state? Would people be free to leave the state? If \"citizens\" had not entered into explicit restrictive covenants running with their property titles (an odd thing to do voluntarily), would they be able to secede? &gt;So far it seems you're describing a business.\n\nNo. Rothbard's definition of a state:\n\n\"*The State may therefore be defined as that organization which possesses either or both (in actual fact, almost always both) of the following characteristics:*\n\n    *it acquires its revenue by physical coercion (taxation); and\n    *it achieves a compulsory monopoly of force and of ultimate decision-making power over a given territorial area.\"\n\nA voluntarliy erected state would fulfill the second criteria, but not the first.\n\n&gt;Would this state get all of its property from voluntary donations\n\nRight, people would grant the state the power to defend their life and their (and only their) property. \n\n&gt;If \"citizens\" had not entered into explicit restrictive covenants running with their property titles (an odd thing to do voluntarily), would they be able to secede?\n\nWell, that would depend on the agreement. Either the person has to leave their property or the person can seced with his property, I am not sure which would be more likely. &gt; A voluntarliy erected state would fulfill the second criteria, but not the first.\n\nThen how is it different from me buying a gun with my own money and using it to murder by neighbor? Sure, I haven't stolen any money from my neighbor, so it's nominally better than me stealing my neighbor's gun and murdering him with it, but it's still pretty bad. It would be like buying a gun and only using it when you or your property is being aggressed against. But the second trait is\n\n&gt; it achieves a compulsory monopoly of force and of ultimate decision-making power over a given territorial area.\n\nPresumably, that territorial area includes property belonging to people that are not paying members of the \"state.\" If it doesn't, then it's literally just a voluntary coalition of individuals, which no anarcho-capitalist should have a problem with. &gt;So far it seems you're describing a business.\n\nNo. Rothbard's definition of a state:\n\n\"*The State may therefore be defined as that organization which possesses either or both (in actual fact, almost always both) of the following characteristics:*\n\n    *it acquires its revenue by physical coercion (taxation); and\n    *it achieves a compulsory monopoly of force and of ultimate decision-making power over a given territorial area.\"\n\nA voluntarliy erected state would fulfill the second criteria, but not the first.\n\n&gt;Would this state get all of its property from voluntary donations\n\nRight, people would grant the state the power to defend their life and their (and only their) property. \n\n&gt;If \"citizens\" had not entered into explicit restrictive covenants running with their property titles (an odd thing to do voluntarily), would they be able to secede?\n\nWell, that would depend on the agreement. Either the person has to leave their property or the person can seced with his property, I am not sure which would be more likely. A voluntarily-erected state would not meet the second characteristic, because it would be a *voluntary* monopoly of force and not a *compulsory* monopoly of force.\n\nAgain, you're describing a community patronizing and comprising a security business. If you want to describe that as a state, then everyone in this sub is a statist. &gt;A voluntarily-erected state would not meet the second characteristic, because it would be a voluntary monopoly of force and not a compulsory monopoly of force.\n\nYes it would. \"it *achieves* a compulsory monopoly of force and of ultimate decision-making power over a given territorial area.\". By this definition the ability to use compulsory force could be granted voluntarily.  Contract and property rights enforcement is not compulsory force - it is voluntary. You haven't described a single activity of this organization that qualifies as compulsion for the purposes of that definition.\n\nYou can continue to swear up and down that it's a state, but anarcho-capitalists aren't going to agree with you, because it doesn't meet our definition. Feel free to call yourself a minarchist, but you're not describing anything that anarcho-capitalists disagree with. &gt;A voluntarily-erected state would not meet the second characteristic, because it would be a voluntary monopoly of force and not a compulsory monopoly of force.\n\nYes it would. \"it *achieves* a compulsory monopoly of force and of ultimate decision-making power over a given territorial area.\". By this definition the ability to use compulsory force could be granted voluntarily.  And what if a child turns 18 and his parents die. He never agreed to this \"social contract\". He is being controlled against his will.  May I recommend that you check out The Machinery of Freedom https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o\n\nFree PDF http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf   with minarchy I'm forced to deal with shitty cops and a military. with ancapism I don't have to deal with that.\n\nnothing philosophical or hypothetical about it, it's just like being stuck with one big phone company. &gt;I don't have to deal with that.\n\nYou seem like the problem of all crime will be lifted if police leave, but instead, have to pay a possibly higher price than the current taxes going to police to do a possibly worse job than what a Minarchist police would.\n\nBut that is just how it sounded. I would love some debate on the security issue. :)  By definition it acts in a manner that would be criminal for the rest of us, prohibiting the pursuit of justice and defense from alternatives to the state (by claiming a monopoly).  Do you not think that there can be private arbitration and security guards under a minarchist regime? There currently is (albeit limited), so I do assume there could be. Of course, the nature of the state is that no other courts have higher authority. I also believe criminal law is, well, criminal in nature, versus civil law, since it strips the rights of the victim in pursuing their own justice.  So you would agree that there in fact exist alternatives to the services that the state \"provides\", then why is it a monopoly?\n\n&gt; it strips the rights of the victim in pursuing their own justice. \n\nPersonal revenge? &gt;So you would agree that there in fact exist alternatives to the services that the state \"provides\", then why is it a monopoly?\n\nThere's no true competition, as the state maintains a higher authority. All arbitration and defense companies must operate under the authority of a state. It's also impossible to enter the judicial field at will, as courts must be accepted by the state institution. \n\n&gt;Personal revenge?\n\nI'm referring to the nature of criminal law versus civil law. The state, an arbitrary third party, usurps the position of plaintiff. If I murder someone the one who inherits the tort has the right to hold me accountable, not some random third party. Courts/legal representation are a service to be hired like any other, involuntary arrangements are unjust.  &gt;It's also impossible to enter the judicial field at will, as courts must be accepted by the state institution. \n\nSure, but let's say people form private trade organizations with private regulations and a strong focus on reputation. Then the arbitrator could rule to exclude people who break the rules from participating in the organization, however the private arbitrator could not rule to punish the rule breaker with physical force since that would be seen as an initiation of force by the state. \n\nMy point is that there exist alternatives to the state, but I agree with your point that only state courts are able to determine when retaliatory force can be used. \n\n&gt;Courts/legal representation are a service to be hired like any other, involuntary arrangements are unjust. \n\nI agree, however what if it is a voluntarily erected minarchy (the murderer and the murdered have both signed such an agreement) with a seperation between state and economy and where the state's only function is to protect life and property? &gt;I agree, however what if it is a voluntarily erected minarchy (the murderer and the murdered have both signed such an agreement) with a seperation between state and economy and where the state's only function is to protect life and property?\n\nIf it's voluntary I wouldn't even consider it a state. Voluntary consent isn't required to punish a criminal anyhow, the only voluntary arrangement I care about is between the judiciary and the victim/plaintiff. A state does not offer such arrangement.  &gt;If it's voluntary I wouldn't even consider it a state.\n\nEven if it maintains the highest auhority and all arbitration and defense companies must operate under the authority of it? If that authority is voluntary, so that the \"citizenry\" are nothing more than customers who could readily switch to an alternative, *equal* authority in competition with that hegemony, it's not a state. It's merely a monopoly. Of course, monopolies never really happen in the market, so that's a pretty impossible hypothetical society.  By definition it acts in a manner that would be criminal for the rest of us, prohibiting the pursuit of justice and defense from alternatives to the state (by claiming a monopoly).   The State. This contributes a little more than nothing to the conversation. I would love for you to elaborate further why that \"The State\" is bad if it were truly Minarchist?  I used to be a big minarchist/return to the constitution, but to use Lysander Spooner to summarize my shift away:\n\n&gt;But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case it is unfit to exist.\n\nIt's not so much that \"Oh well now I'm ancap!\", just keep searching for true things.    1. What roles do you think a Minarchist state should fulfill?\n\n2. How do you think those roles ought to be funded? [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism) sums it up pretty nicely. Just the first paragraph answers your questions\n\n&gt;Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a libertarian capitalist political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions.[1][2][3] Such states are generally called night-watchman states.\n\n&gt;Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity. It doesn't answer #2.  How do these things get funded?\n\n&gt; In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions.\n\nHow do you pay the people running these fire departments?  Where does the Minarchist state get the money to buy fire trucks? The people. Involuntary taxes. What you want me to say. Yes, I realize this and I believe it is wrong. How do you accept any level of Statehood when you know that every single function of it would have to be funded through the threat of violence?  Military helicopters flying down city streets, for one thing. I don't see why that is a bad thing. It's just patrol to legitamitely see if people are violating any Minarchist crimes such as: aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud. If it is truly a Minarchist society, that shouldn't be anything bad. I can't really see why 30mm guns or hellfire missiles wuold be needed against any of those crimes.\n\nI was referring to [this recent incident](http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/01/29/1346237/machine-gun-fire-from-military-helicopters-flying-over-downtown-miami), BTW.\n\nThis is more about intimidating the public and preparing soldiers and cops to fire on citizens than any kind of crime prevention.  First off, and I'm sure you realize this - by their very existence through taxation, states are coercive in nature and violate property rights.\n\nNext, we know that the free market works wonders in whatever are we allow it to exist. If capitalism works so well in production of everything else, why not in security? Conversely, if socialism works so well in the provision of security, why not everywhere else?\n\nWe believe that a free market in the production of security would be both stable and more efficient and just than the system we have today.\n\nChaos Theory is a great (small) book to read on the matter if you have questions about this:\n\nhttp://mises.org/books/chaostheory.pdf\n\nFor more resources, see\n\nhttp://candlemind.com/projects/progclub/file/michael/getEducated.php?listID=16 Thanks for the insight! Security is one of the only questions I have about Anarcho-Capitalism. I'll look more into the chaos theory when I have time. :)  In terms of mentality and lifestyle, being a minarchist tends to mean caring about politics.\n\nPolitics is expensive when you're young in that you need to pay a great deal of attention to it at all times. You need to go to party organizations, listen to politicians speak, and learn all the mechanics of how to win elections and raise money to run them.\n\nWhen you're older, you either suffer the major opportunity cost of becoming a professional political operator, or you give up a good chunk of your wages donating to politicians.\n\nAs an anarcho-capitalist, while you may not have the satisfaction of getting your man or woman in office, you save a lot of time and money that would otherwise be spent on the mechanics of getting your guys elected. Purely as a practical matter, being a radical provides the satisfaction of being correct without the dull obligation of pursuing ineffective democratic means to achieve your ends.\n\nBeing a minarchist means playing a game in which the odds are completely against you and your task is to convince a huge number of people to vote against their personal interests. Being an anarcho-capitalist just means persuading enough people (but not even a substantial minority) that it's the correct position. In my version, or how I see Minarchism, I believe that there should be a minimal executive branch where there is more like a person that deals with police and jails. The job is so simple and so defined (in a truly Minarchist society) that voting will hardly matter.\n\nI would love a rebuttle because it was hard for me to write this comment and I might be edging toward AnCapism with this issue. Yes. How much money would you need to raise and spend over a period of years to achieve your goal of getting a Minarchist in office? Even if you got a Minarchist into the presidency, how would you muster the financial resources to persuade the rest of the state and its minions to go along with these plans to dismantle it?\n\nI suspect the number is in excess of several hundred million or billions of dollars. Ron Paul raised around $40m for the 2012 election and didn't win the nomination. Romney raised and spent over $400 million. Obama raised $700 million and spent almost all of it. (Source: OpenSecrets.org)\n\nOur community lacks the financial wherewithal to compete effectively with the &gt;$1B raised by both major parties for just the presidential election alone. Romney alone raised more money from the Financial Services / Insurance / Real Estate industries than Ron Paul raised, total, from all sources.\n\nI certainly agree with you that a minimal executive branch would be an improvement over the current state of affairs. However, I doubt that even accounting for the cleverness of libertarian thinkers, that we can compete on the national electoral level. I'm very tired right now, but I read your comment and felt it needed a response, so I'm sorry if this doesn't come out as well as I like.\n\nI believe you are correct. I wish it wasn't like that, but the reality is, is that it just is. If you want to be in politics, you need a campaign and money to fund it. :\\ I agree with you entirely on the matter now.  Liberty.  Why does the individual not matter?  Why am I not free to disagree with you? Care to elaborate on that? I don't really see what you are trying to get across with this comment... The state is a monopoly on adjudication, enforcement, and ultimately uses violence or the threat of violence to ensure compliance.  It's funded through coercion and participation is mandatory based upon imaginary boundaries.  \n\nAs such, the individual does not matter.  If I disagree with your state, I am not free to act upon my disagreement and choose not to participate.  The individual is not free... there is a restriction on liberty. Agreeing with this. This is the ONE problem I have with ANY government, and where I step across the border to AnCapism.   If your government makes taxes voluntary then it probably wouldn't be that bad.  How would one resolve disputes with this group of people you call government? What kinds of disputes? Theft, extortion, contract violation, assault, torture, kidnapping murder, fraud etc In a Minarchist society, you would deal with courts, like the current system we have now, but hopefully more fair. I might ask the same question for Anarcho-Capitalists. Is there any sort of court system? How would somebody go about doing that capitalistically? In a Minarchist society, you would deal with courts, like the current system we have now, but hopefully more fair. I might ask the same question for Anarcho-Capitalists. Is there any sort of court system? How would somebody go about doing that capitalistically? Let me make a simpler case: I do not agree that your court is legitimate. I refuse to pay for its existence. What are you going to do about that? \n  The biggest difference to me would be that the minarchy would steal money from me regularly.  The minarchist state is essentially just a socialized protection service Basically. :\\ My toes are hanging off of the cliff when it comes to switching over to AnCapism. Ya just think of it this way. Why do you oppose socialized healthcare? For me it's that healthcare is commodity. If you have a right to someone else labor that's slavery. Why is protection any different? The leap from into libertarianism is essentially just understanding that the state is morally just when it acts as a protection service--defending life liberty and property. Now understanding that state as a socialized protection service is the next step. We want protection. I just argue that I want to decide how much of it I want, and for what price. I have a gun, I might just protect myself and choose to not buy protection, just like I might choose not to buy health insurance. The point is that its your choice. And competition will ultimately provide the best distribution of protection, just like any other commodity.  \n\nFurthermore the posts here saying the minarchist state is bad because it would grow into a bigger state have a flawed argument. Theyre accepting the premise that the minarchist state is just in itself and that it is only immoral because it might one day grow. No, it's immoral because it advocates forcing people to purchase protection from one entity whether they want it or not. You put my argument into the right words. :) But yes. I agree completely.  \"Limited government\" is an oxymoron, moron.  involuntary. One word answers aren't really what I had in mind when I said I wanted to spark conversation. :\\ The drawback of minarchism is that it is involuntary. Don't write a short sentence question and expect to get a thesis in response. I only ask for a short sentence. I never really expected anything more than a sentence or two, even though people have really gone out of their way to write some really in depth comments in this post, which I really appreciate.\n\nBut yes. There will always be involuntary things in any Government, which is one of the reasons that I'm now AnCapist after reading some of the in-depth comments about Minarchism vs AnCapism. Yeah. I really do not believe there should be involuntary taxing. I was fooling myself when I said it was a necessary evil.  I suggest you check out Practical Anarchy by Stefan Molyneux.\n\nYou can find it here: http://www.freedomainradio.com/FreeBooks.aspx Your comment seems to be under a lot of debate when it comes to upvote/downvote ratio. Is there any speculation I should know about? This sub has some anti-stef fanatics. Anti-Stef? Stefan Molyneux, the author.",

While it's nice that some Republican pollsters have noticed that their 'base' is going to die soon, and that they've nothing to replace it, it's not yet evidence that it's a useful political organization for anyone who cares much about advancing freedom.\n\nThe single political change that would change my opinion positively would be an announcement of a \"special development zone\" or something like that anywhere in the US that was exempt from Federal taxes, state taxes, and other regulations. It could be in a desert or an arctic wasteland. I wouldn't care.\n\nThe Republicans won't do this. I doubt they would even lower spending by half a percent even if they won the legislature and the executive. They wouldn't do it even if every supreme court justice died in a freak clerical accident while a Republican was president, giving him an awesome opportunity to stack the courts.\n\n What they'll do is talk up 'personal freedom' and 'individual liberty' while electioneering, and then drop those issues in favor of \"kill all foreigners\" and \"more welfare for old people\" and \"more free money for my corporate buddies.\"\n\nThis is why I give them zero dollars, zero votes, and zero fucks when they're campaigning. Except the ones that they extract from me, that is. Good post.  things are changing at a pace unlike ever seen before. an outright anarchist wing of the Republican party is a near-future possibility.\n\nkinda weird to think about. An anarchist wing of a national political party is something of an oxymoron. it's just a private organization.\n\nfor the most part anyway. Smith v. Allwright is an interesting Supreme Court case. It is just a private organization in exactly the same way that the Federal Reserve is private.  In practice it is an arm of the state, and most definitions of a political party involve attempting to win elections (and anarchists are against hierarchy, and thus elected officials).\n\nAt the 'best' I think what we will see is people with minarchist tendencies (rather than the 'big' government conservatives who try and legislate morality) become more popular.

I just hope they don't give up abortion, the rest is good to hear.  A couple of comments:\n\n1) The Republican party uses abortion as bait for evangelicals. Voting for them because you think they will do a thing about Roe vs. Wade when they did nothing with a president and majorities in Congress is just giving into a total con job. Behind your back they laugh at evangelicals and call them stupid rubes. \n\n2) I oppose the act of abortion but it is a very complicated isssue and I honestly think it's bigger than a political solution. The question I can't answer yes to is \"Should we treat women who get abortions like murderers.\" If not that, then what? Definitely better at the state laboratory level where there's a better chance of finding some better middle ground than what we have now and allowing the truly determined to make their choice across state boundaries.\n\n3) Americans are culturally violent and trained to make terrible choices out of simple convenience. I think it's impossible to pretend our love of war, violence, and death is limited to abortion. It is ubiquitous in our media and our propaganda, in our actions and our words. If we can be callous about the life of innocents half a world away over geopolitical issues, how much of a step is it to discard a life because it is not a \"good fit\" for one's lifestyle.\n\ntl:dr If you want to solve the issue then both a devolution of state power and a cultural shift towards holding life as precious must occur.\n\nEdited for throughness. &gt; Americans are culturally violent and trained to make terrible choices out of simple convenience. I think it's impossible to pretend our love of war, violence, and death is limited to abortion. \n\nYou would do well not to generalize in this way.

There are very few left in the field of take anything even approaching a noble savage view seriously.\n\nI pray you are exaggerating on the \"trade as zero-sum\" bit as well.  The wrongness of that idea is... extreme (though you see it all the time among laymen).\n\nI've seen so much over-the-top gushing about Graeber's book from lefties that I have considered picking it up several times.  I have trouble believing it makes both of those errors, but now I feel like I have to read it just to find out. I started reading Debt after one of the leftists here recommended it.

Mutualist/left-libertarian here.\n\n&gt;Trade as an adversarial zero sum game. One party wins and one party loses.\n\nThe idea was that it is *nearly* impossible to make an \"even\" trade. Possible, but implausible. This eradicates the commonly accepted notion that we created currency to deal with this double-blind circumstance required to achieve barter trade. Barter *is* inefficient... So inefficient that it never really happened that way.\n\nThis is both a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Through a personal benefit, individualist, dare I say Randian viewpoint, this is a bad thing since uneven trade benefits one person (hopefully one's self). \n\nIn a more communistic approach (he qualifies \"communist\" several times), it can be a mutually beneficial thing since it creates a never ending cycle of shared debt. This builds relationships and co-dependency.\n\n&gt;The 2008 collapse as due to insufficient regulation.\n\nThat's an awfully narrow viewpoint to take from his argument.\n\n&gt;\"Why won't the IMF let the developing world be more socialist?!?\" (uh, why do you need their permission?)\n\nThe IMF has the backing of most of the industrialized world's governments. So yes, as starter/developing nation, you *do* need the permission of the IMF if you want to trade with anyone that is not also a starter/developing nation or black market \"criminals\". &gt;The idea was that it is nearly impossible to make an \"even\" trade. Possible, but implausible. This eradicates the commonly accepted notion that we created currency to deal with this double-blind circumstance required to achieve barter trade. Barter is inefficient... So inefficient that it never really happened that way.\n\n&gt;This is both a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Through a personal benefit, individualist, dare I say Randian viewpoint, this is a bad thing since uneven trade benefits one person (hopefully one's self). \n\nWho is determining whether a trade is benefiting one party more than another? Certainly not the participants in the trade. Value is subjective and it is self evident that if two people are participating in a voluntary exchange, free from coercion, that each subjectively values that which they are trading for over that which they are trading away. It takes a rather substantial amount of mental gymnastics to arrive at any other conclusion.  Disagree with the idea of \"voluntary exchange\" all you want. But you apparently missed the point entirely.\n\nIt wasn't about whether the exchange was voluntary. I understand that is the basis of your belief system. However, that wasn't the argument at all. The fact that \"it's a voluntary exchange\" or that \"value is subjective\" is nearly unrelated to the subject at hand.\n\nThe idea is that even if the value is subjective, it is rarely considered \"even\" by both sides. This is actually a good thing because it denotes that we will be engaging in another trade to try to get back to even. Which again won't truly be even and thus we will once again engage in trade in the future. Therefore, if we are to be regularly engaging in further trades, it is not even necessary to \"trade\" every time. We are operating on the intent to trade. I'm not giving you my shoes under the assumption that you will give me 3 sandwiches regardless of the time scale. It's the idea that I'm giving you my shoes under the assumption that some time in the future, you will have something that I desire and that you will remember that I gave you my shoes way back, thus I am now entitled to that new object that you possess. If you refuse, then our relationship is essentially over, is it not? It's a constant: \"You owe me\".\n\nWhat's even more important, is your idea is still dependent on the idea that we as humans used to rely entirely on barter systems for trade, which we did not. The entire idea of barter without a predetermined and agreed upon currency system is nearly impossible and relies on a double-blind coincidence of need. Sure, we can and always have just traded things; but for a community or even a market, this is highly implausible. So implausible that it is far more logical to conclude that it just didn't happen on a community wide, much less nation-wide scale.\n\nBarter is nearly impossible. Rather we operated under I.O.U.s for millennia, then developed currency as a way to make a more consistent method of closing debts. Again you've stated that trade is somehow \"uneven\" and again I will ask according to whom? Both parties participating in a trade will not only view the trade as even, but will believe that they are better off for participating in the trade. If this wasn't true the trade would not have taken place. \n\nI had trouble understanding the remainder of your post and it seemed rather incoherent. From what I understand you are saying that because tribal cultures would participate in a system based on reciprocity that this is somehow the natural state of man? The example of the warriors of a tribe who go out on a hunt and those that successfully kill an animal share the meat with the rest of the hunters under the impression that if, one day, they aren't able to make a kill they can rely on the other hunters to provide them with food. This, in your view, would be the economic system of choice absent state intervention? Yet you say that a system of barter, facilitated by a shared medium of exchange (currency) is highly implausible on a nation-wide scale?\n\nThis reciprocity driven exchange may have been beneficial in an environment of extreme scarcity where there was minimal distribution of labor, but as soon as trading amongst people over any kind of distance begins to take place this system is rendered utterly obsolete and a barter system is adopted. \n\nPeople overcome the dual coincidence of need by trading items for things that a large portion of the population view as valuable, these items serve as a pseudo currency (these pseudo currencies existed outside state control so please do not attempt to rebut me by claiming this manner of trade is a product of he state). This situation has occurred numerous times throughout history with items from salt, to furs, to porcelain, to silk all acting as a medium of exchange du jour. Ugh, nevermind. I tried.\n\nYou ignored the entire point once again. I'm walking away.  Disagree with the idea of \"voluntary exchange\" all you want. But you apparently missed the point entirely.\n\nIt wasn't about whether the exchange was voluntary. I understand that is the basis of your belief system. However, that wasn't the argument at all. The fact that \"it's a voluntary exchange\" or that \"value is subjective\" is nearly unrelated to the subject at hand.\n\nThe idea is that even if the value is subjective, it is rarely considered \"even\" by both sides.

This is actually a good thing because it denotes that we will be engaging in another trade to try to get back to even.\n\nYou are still assuming that there is an \"even\" trade, and that the alternative is that one side \"loses\" and the other \"gains\".  But the key to subjective value is that, when the trade is made, both sides feel that they gained - they got something they wanted more than what they gave up.  There is no one who loses out - who is \"owed\" - once the trade is completed.\n\nThe use of IOUs or any form of credit is merely temporally displaced trade, such that instead of completing in an \"instantaneous\" manner, it completes over some period of time.  Barter credit is a simple trade of a good now for a good at some future time.  Money credit involves some abstraction of values such that you give me a chicken and I will trade you something valued about the same (accounting for interest, perhaps), but you aren't going to get a herd of cattle or anything.  Such would require some form of \"money\" to keep track of this - even if it is an abstraction in a ledger.\n\nSuch credit is a partial, but not complete, solution to the double coincidence of wants and divisibility that money completely solves. &gt;Such credit is a partial, but not complete, solution to the double coincidence of wants and divisibility that money completely solves.\n\nThere you go. You reached the conclusion all on your own. *That* is the point. I have no idea why people are pushing all these unrelated topics into this conversation.\n\nThank you. Because your thoughts are muddled, hard-to-decipher, and seem to imply things which it now seems you don't mean to imply. This is why I usually do not interact with AnCaps. However, the repeated attacks on someone like David Graeber did lead me here. It is upsetting to see the erroneous conclusions made of his arguments, mostly out of ignorance. Disagree all you want, but at least attack his actual positions not the straw-man positions like the OP did.\n\n(example, it's perfectly okay to hate American-Liberals. Just do so for the right reasons; if you oppose American-Liberals because you disagree with the idea that they think the sun revolves around the Earth, well that's just stupid because that's not what they believe)\n\nIt clearly isn't that muddled or hard-to-decipher since you reached the exact conclusion I was trying to lead you to. \n\n(yes, I did not spell it out completely on purpose, I want *you* to come to it) This is why I usually do not interact with AnCaps.

Disagree all you want, but at least attack his actual positions not the straw-man positions like the OP did.\n\nGraeber's own position is muddled and fallacious.  For instance, he contends that money is a creation of government or religious authority - that government can simply declare that silver is now money, and people will know what to do with that without a prior market involving silver as money.  He also neglects that the use of credit is *still either barter or monetary in nature*. Mutualist/left-libertarian here.\n\n&gt;Trade as an adversarial zero sum game. One party wins and one party loses.\n\nThe idea was that it is *nearly* impossible to make an \"even\" trade. Possible, but implausible.

Possible, but implausible. This eradicates the commonly accepted notion that we created currency to deal with this double-blind circumstance required to achieve barter trade.\n\nWho is saying anything about \"even\" trade?  Trade does not need to be \"even\" in order to happen spontaneously.  In fact, not only is it highly unlikely for a trade to be exactly \"even\", it is impossible to quantify such a thing, since value is entirely subjective.\n\nIn order for a voluntary trade to take place all that is required is that each party gain value from the transaction.  It is perfectly normal (and in no way unjust) that one party might gain slightly more value than the other (although competition drives each party's values as close as possible to equal).\n\n&gt; Barter is inefficient... So inefficient that it never really happened that way.\n\n&gt;What's even more important, is your idea is still dependent on the idea that we as humans used to rely entirely on barter systems for trade, which we did not. The entire idea of barter without a predetermined and agreed upon currency system is nearly impossible and relies on a double-blind coincidence of need.\n\nThis is just nonsense.  How can you possibly think people have not or will not trade without a violent third party involved?  The opposite makes more sense, violence tends to reduce the willingness and demand for trade.\n\nYou cannot possibly think trade and barter historically has not happened without a state.  I understand that there have been few examples of stateless societies to disprove such nonsense but there have been MANY states which are either so small as to be negligible in the analysis of trade and markets or have either been absent or inefficient in the intervention of the market. &gt;Trade does not need to be \"even\" in order to happen spontaneously.\n\nThat's my point. I would even wager that *most* trade is uneven. Thats' what makes it a valuable trade. Not only did someone win, but the other person gained something *and* it usually denotes another trade in the future. \n\n&gt;How can you possibly think people have not or will not trade without a violent third party involved\n\nWhat? Where did you get that?\n\n&gt;You cannot possibly think trade and barter historically has not happened without a state.\n\nNo. I don't. Where are you getting this shit? Where did I advocate that? \n\n(It's amazing how quickly you AnCaps revert to \"but, but, the state man! But, but, voluntary agreement man!\" arguments, especially when the issue is completely unrelated.)\n\nThe presence or absence of the state is completely unrelated to the concept of \"barter vs communal debt\" as a form of trade.\n\nYes, much further down the line, the state has historically been the first entity to institute a form of universal currency. This is merely a coincidence since the state usually has the most to gain from the existence of universal currency (primarily in the form of taxes payable to the temple as we see in Egypt and Sumeria).  &gt;That's my point. I would even wager that most trade is uneven. Thats' what makes it a valuable trade. Not only did someone win, but the other person gained something and it usually denotes another trade in the future.\n\nYou are contradicting yourself.  Is \"uneven\" trade good or bad?\n\n&gt;Through a personal benefit, individualist, dare I say Randian viewpoint, this is a bad thing since uneven trade benefits one person (hopefully one's self).\n\nNo.  Non-coerced trade benefits both parties, even if it benefits one party more than the other.  What are you misunderstanding here?\n\n&gt;The entire idea of barter without a predetermined and agreed upon currency system is nearly impossible and relies on a double-blind coincidence of need. Sure, we can and always have just traded things\n\n&gt;Barter is nearly impossible. Rather we operated under I.O.U.s for millennia, then developed currency as a way to make a more consistent method of closing debts.\n\nSo you're saying barter is impossible without currency because it is \"uneven\"?  I don't see why this is true or any evidence from you showing that it is true, nor do I see why it pertains to anything being discussed here, in particular the misguided concept of a \"zero-sum\" market.\n\n&gt;The presence or absence of the state is completely unrelated to the concept of \"barter vs communal debt\" as a form of trade.\n\nI don't know what you're saying here.  What is \"communal debt\" without a state? &gt;You are contradicting yourself. Is \"uneven\" trade good or bad?\n\nNo I'm not. My point is that it is both good and bad.\n\n&gt;So you're saying barter is impossible without currency because it is \"uneven\"?\n\nNo, I'm saying it is implausible as a primary form of trade because it is entirely reliant on a double-blind coincidence of needs. It necessitates that you have something I desire at the time that I have something that you desire.\n\nPossible, but implausible, especially on a community-wide (much less national or international) scale. \n\n&gt; nor do I see why it pertains to anything being discussed here, in particular the misguided concept of a \"zero-sum\" market.\n\nBecause that is a misunderstanding of David Graeber's point in the book. The OP either did not read the whole thing, did not pay attention, or outright misunderstood the argument Graeber was making.\n\n&gt;What is \"communal debt\" without a state?\n\nWhat does the state have to do with communal debt? How do you keep coming up with this shit?\n\n If you're remodeling a house and your co-worker asked you to hand him a hammer that is near you, you wouldn't stop and say \"What will you give me for it?\" No, you'd just hand him the hammer. That is communism, \"each according to his needs, each according to his abilities\". He had the need, you had the ability. \n\nLater when you need a drill that's near him, you'll ask him to hand you the drill; he just does this without a second thought. If he did think about it, the only real thing that might go through his head is \"Well, he did hand me that hammer earlier. I should probably just hand him the drill now.\" \n\nCommunal debt.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the presence or absence of the state?\n\n(Thus I reiterate: It's amazing how quickly you AnCaps revert to \"but, but, the state man! But, but, voluntary agreement man!\" arguments, especially when the issue is completely unrelated.) &gt;If you're remodeling a house and your co-worker asked you to hand him a hammer that is near you, you wouldn't stop and say \"What will you give me for it?\" No, you'd just hand him the hammer. That is communism, \"each according to his needs, each according to his abilities\". He had the need, you had the ability.\n\nLol, what?  Oh that's communism?  Why didn't you say so?  Who could say no to that!\n\nThis is an extremely simplistic analogy.  A more realistic one would be various individuals from anywhere (more importantly not across the street from you) asking for any number of hammers.  Why should I give them said hammers?  I only have one hammer which I built with my own hands from my own wood and ore.  The concept that I can randomly steal a hammer from someone else does not justify them initially stealing it from me.\n\nThere are also many problems that come up with this system.  Someone who steals my hammer (whether I let them or not is irrelevant) does not have the same incentive to take care of my hammer, clean it, not leave it out in the rain, etc that I do, since that person did not make the initial investment to create the hammer.  This is the tragedy of the commons.\n\nAlso, because of this fact, the fact that anyone can steal my hammer and treat it like shit, and the fact that I can simply steal a hammer from someone else, there is no incentive to create new hammers.  Why would I spend the extra time and effort to make me a nice new hammer if it just gets taken and treated like shit?  If no one has incentive to create, they also have no incentive to innovate.  This is another major downfall of communism.\n\nI could go on and on about the many issues with your idea of the perfect system here but I really need to get back to work.\n\nI still don't see how this is \"Communal debt\", what you described is fundamentally no different that individual debt.  What is the difference?  The fact that it does not have to be voluntarily agreed upon?  That doesn't make it \"communal\" that just makes it theft.\n\n&gt;(Thus I reiterate: It's amazing how quickly you AnCaps revert to \"but, but, the state man!

How does this understanding \"eradicate the idea that we that we created currency to deal with this double-blind circumstance required to achieve barter trade.\"  Isn't this reasoning entirely consistent with the problem of matching desires in bartering? &gt;because the scenario where A values what B holds more than what he holds, and B values what A holds more than what he holds simultaneously is unlikely, currency-free barter scenarios are were probably uncommon.\n\nCorrect. Possible, but entirely dependent upon that double-blind chance of need. Thus \"possible, but implausible\".\n\n&gt;Isn't this reasoning entirely consistent with the problem of matching desires in bartering?\n\nNo. The claim made by Graeber in *Debt: The First 5,000 Years*, is that the commonly accepted fable of...\n\n* A long time ago, humans traded via barter. Barter was inefficient (because it really is), so we came up with currency as a way to make trade more efficient. Then we can develop debt and loans in the form of currency.\n\n...is untrue. It was started by Adam Smith and no one questioned it. We accept it because that's just what everyone thinks (ask anyone what humans used before currency). Contrary to this belief, we have *lots* of archaeological and anthropological evidence that we had debt systems long before we developed currency systems. \n\nThe oldest known piece of writing *anywhere* is actually a bar-tab. A *literal* bar-tab from Sumeria. This predates any writings or evidence of currency later found in Sumeria and Egypt.\n\nAll evidence points to the fact that humanity did not operate on barter, but rather individual and communal debt systems, ranging from very simple (person to person) to lengthy and complex (years of debt, temple payments, international trade).\n\nThus two points:\n\n* Barter without currency is laughable. Possible, but implausible.\n\n* The commonly accepted idea that we had barter, then currency, then debt is actually backwards. We operated on debt, developed currency to address debt, then we had barter systems *after* currency.\n\nThis is nothing new, actually. This has been anthropological thought for at least 150 years. Kind of a pet-peeve of anthropologists everywhere is this ongoing perpetration of the myth started by Adam Smith.  Ok, now I understand.  I really don't think the argument followed clearly from your initial logic.  Thus the confusion that continued throughout the comment thread.\n\nI don't want to push it much without reading the book, but as far as I understand it I definitely have some concerns...\n\n1)  The utility of barter exchange is minimal until we get to relatively complex societies.  People throughout the vast majority of history had very few \"goods\".  The \"capital\" in a hunter-gatherer society is rapidly approaching 0, and everyone has the same toolkit so there isn't the kind of diversity that facilitates mutualistic exchanges.  We shouldn't expect barter because it serves minimal function.\n\nHowever, if Graeber is arguing that \"community debt\" is running the show in small scale societies, he is backing one argument in a very contentious debate.  [Inclusive fitness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness), [selfish herding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfish_herd_theory), and especially [\"tolerated theft\"](http://evoanth.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/how-did-food-sharing-start/) explain human cooperative exchange in a way that is much more consistent with the evidence.  \n\n2)  Even when people start accumulating capital goods in early production societies (i.e. early agriculturalists and herders) everyone has \"capital\" but it is largely of the same kind.  However, barter exchange sure seems to happen in the few cases that it makes sense.  Herders absolutely barter over how many cows and goats I need to give in exchange for your daughter's hand in marriage.  Herd animals and grain are also commonly exchanged for political alliances and prestige goods.      \n\nSimilarly when two different early production systems bump into one another, *they do* engage in barter.  Herders trade meat, milk, and hides for grain when they meat agriculturalists.  This is common across the globe.  Similarly, hunter-gatherers exchange hunted game and foraged goods with food producers for agricultural goods and milk.  The best known case of this is the relationship between the Pygmies and Bantus in central Africa.  The same actually occurs between groups in the population I work with in southern Africa.  I can also think of many example of exchange of grain or animals for \"labor\", mainly herding a wealthy man's animals or building fences for gardens.\n\nThese are all examples of barter relationships, all of which occur in systems analogous to those found throughout the globe long before Sumeria, Egypt or any temples...\n\nAgain, I need to read the book before I criticize, but the argument isn't obvious to me at first blush.      \n\n &gt;These are all examples of barter relationships\n\nNot entirely. Most of those were done on a debt or future-trade basis. That is the point from an anthropological and archaeological standpoint.\n\nAll of the evidence of barter systems exists *after* we developed currency. Yet that's not the important part...\n\nWe have lots of evidence of basic and complex debt agreements *long before* the first occurrences of currency.\n\nThus the argument goes:\n\n* It is a myth that we operated on barter, developed currency to be more efficient, then developed debt systems after existing currency markets.\n\nIt actually went the other way around:\n\n* We had very common simple and complex debt arrangements, developed currency to settle debt, and later we see barter economies after we have a pre-determined currency value.\n\nIt is not to say that straight across barter exchanges didn't happen, they always have, still do, and always will happen. But they are exceptions because they (always have, always will) require a double-blind coincidence of needs. That form of trade *only* happens *if* I have something you need *and* you have something that I need. It is highly unlikely that barter could ever exist as a medium of exchange across an entire community, much less on a national scale. \n\nThe idea that we used to barter then developed currency is a myth.\n\nIt is important, not because it's a neat little fact about history that is fun to throw in people's face when they keep perpetrating a myth similar to \"We only use 10% of our brains\" (although that is fun), because it completely alters our perception of debt, its usefulness, its dangers, its function, and its inevitability in our society. As such, it should alter both our perceptions of ownership, trade, as well as our communistic nature. \n\nDebt has been a part of human interaction as long as we have been humans. Barter was the exception to the rule. It was never the primary form of exchange. Mutualist/left-libertarian here.\n\n&gt;Trade as an adversarial zero sum game. One party wins and one party loses.\n\nThe idea was that it is *nearly* impossible to make an \"even\" trade. Possible, but implausible.

Here's his take on anarcho-capitalism:\n\n&gt; To be honest I'm pretty skeptical about the idea of anarcho-capitalism. If a-caps imagine a world divided into property-holding employers and property-less wage laborers, but with no systematic coercive mechanisms ... well, I just can't see how it would work. You always see a-caps saying \"if I want to hire someone to pick my tomatoes, how are you going to stop me without using coercion?\" Notice how you never see anyone say \"if I want to hire myself out to pick someone else's tomatoes, how are you going to stop me?\" Historically nobody ever did wage labor like that if they had pretty much ANY other option. Similarly when markets start operating outside the state (and they never start outside the state, but sometimes they start operating beyond it), they almost immediate change their character, and stop operating on pure calculating competition, but on other principles. So I just don't think something like they envision would ever happen.\n\n[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fi6l/i_am_david_graeber_an_anthropologist_activist/c850ma5?context=3) [deleted] I have to say I'm impressed with these answers, even if I disagree with him.

Let's focus on our differences once that has been accomplished. [deleted] &gt; I'm not 100% convinced on homesteading/private property so I would love to see competing ancap, mutualist, geolibertarian, and socialist models. \n\nI think that's the ticket right there. Because people have different desires and values, they will determine what constitutes legitimate property in the means they feel is best for them. I can envision an-cap societies in which mutually owned firms can compete and succeed, or adopting a form of geo-libertarianism at its borders with an an-comm society as a means to avoid disputes. \n\nI don't think blanket propositions of declaring one form of property theory being superior works in every instance.   In order for the mutualist, geolibertarian, and socialist models to exist without forcibly taking over territory, they have to accept homesteading as a basis.  What they are really doing is declaring that they have homesteaded some property, and they choose to then transfer it to a collective group or whatever leader of the system they desire.  But they can't infringe upon the property homesteaded by ancaps or unowned property they never use or anything without breaking down any sort of peaceful co-existence.

If homesteading exists, capitalism won't, because the natural form of human relations is communistic gift economics.  One of the main functions of the State is to suppress this, such as through property taxes (which force everyone to sell something in order to acquire the local currency).  With homesteading and no particular reason to become capitalistic, some variety of communistic economy will result, unless some thugs establish a government.\n\nSo you guys need to either admit that your anti-organization philosophy would result in government and drop the \"anarcho-\", or acquire some consistency and drop homesteading (making it totally unworkable), or develop a theory of stateless communism- oh, but we've already done that for you!

They have basically no justification for why those property rights should exist. They just say it would be too \"difficult\" to address the problem (as least, that's what I remember hearing last time I remember someone asking David Friedman, a very long time ago.) \n\nThe reason these property rights should exist is that it is the greatest means of providing utility for a given set of consonant values. Hans Herman Hoppe uses argumentative ethics to prove this, that given that people value truth, communication, and reason, that they must then support property as an extension of those values (if they are to rationally maximize utility). \n\n&gt;So the whole thing makes no sense. By their logic, if you had a poor, kind, generous, decent, but disorganized woman who just couldn't manage her money, and she found the only way she could pay for life-saving medical care for her children was to offer herself up to be slowly tortured to death by some rich sadist, that would not be \"violent\" but would be perfectly morally acceptable. \n\nIf others value her, they will voluntarily subsidize her despite her financial ineptitude. I think this sort of thing is very rare, as even dull people can comprehend that debt is bad when it gets to the point that lenders are unwilling to extend further credit due to risk of total default. If someone does live well beyond their means, incur significant debt, and finds themselves unable to pay it all off, well, tough fucking shit. That means the value they're taking from society, from others, is in excess of the value they are inputing. This is equivalent to a bum on a commune who does some shitty but easy work for ten hours a month whenever he's bored picking lint out of his ass or otherwise lounging around, while still expecting to receive about the usual package for commune members. It's poor incentive structure to allow individuals to do this, since it then incentivises people to perform as little work as considered \"work\" while still subsisting on a standard of living almost parallel with more diligent workers. Considering the disutility of labor (since most people much prefer the marginal unit of leisure to the marginal unit of labor, and the opportunity cost of the latter far exceeds the former barring significant material or psychic motive), most people are apt to abuse any system that allows for easy free-riding. The market enforces discipline if one cannot find a way to provide value to others. \n\nThe only alternative to voluntary subsidies or work is forcing others to submit to servitude for the benefit of the single party. That's exactly what any intelligent anti-statist is trying to distance themselves from by transitioning to a stateless society. To impose that without the state would almost necessarily require the establishment of a quasi-state institution or arbitrary aggression. I have no qualms with the fact that property is violently enforced because the alternative is not rainbow unicorns and gum drops but chaos and anarchy in the pejorative. Unenforced property norms are not really property norms at all in truth and are ripe to abuse even if the number of abusers is marginal. \n\nFor the specific example, I doubt this sort of thing would happen. Most likely the woman could always whore herself out or work another job or more hours to compensate for poor spending habits. She could also entrust her wages to another person who is more adept with finances. But if she cannot manage her resources and squanders them, and others do not value her presence enough to voluntarily subsidize her, it's tough shit. Either she cuts back, adapts, lives in squalid poverty, or she dies and that's just the way it is. If others voluntarily subsidize her, they are at least maintaining if not increasing their subjective standard of living. If they are involuntarily forced to, at the very least the marginal person opposed to this coerced subsidy finds themselves subject to a decreased standard of living. Let's think of the incentives at play with a forced subsidy scenario. What reason does the third party coercing others into providing resources have to act this way? Clearly, it's not for the direct and specific benefit of the woman, damn the costs, or they would soak the costs themselves. If in the context of the state, they're doing it to gain captive votes and expand their own power. If in the context of a non-state bandit, they are doing so to legitimize whatever plunder they seize, which would almost certainly be in excess of the subsidies provided the hapless woman. Otherwise they would stand to gain nothing from risking their lives and property stealing from others and would simply work for the woman's benefit. Whatever the case, the bandit deserves to come under the full force of market law with no quarter. \n\n&gt;Since the entire basis of their claims for their form of capitalism is a moral one, if it can support outcomes like this, that violate almost anyone's sense of morality, no one is ever going to take them seriously so why do we bother ourselves even worrying about them?\n\nThat example is such a shit example. Let's come up with something more concrete and more probable. If we looked at examples on the margins to pick at a political theory, then the problem of the anarchist and the problem of the criminal should render states totally unworkable. Empirically, we know that they are workable to some extent because it turns out that these marginally insignificant problems aren't usually enough to totally impair an institution.  Hoppe's agenda is a fascist nightmare world\nhttp://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/12/journey-into-a-libertarian-future-part-vi-%E2%80%93-certainty.html I have to say I'm impressed with these answers, even if I disagree with him.

You always see a-caps saying \"if I want to hire someone to pick my tomatoes, how are you going to stop me without using coercion?\" Notice how you never see anyone say \"if I want to hire myself out to pick someone else's tomatoes, how are you going to stop me?\" Historically nobody ever did wage labor like that if they had pretty much ANY other option. Similarly when markets start operating outside the state (and they never start outside the state, but sometimes they start operating beyond it), they almost immediate change their character, and stop operating on pure calculating competition, but on other principles. So I just don't think something like they envision would ever happen.\n\n[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fi6l/i_am_david_graeber_an_anthropologist_activist/c850ma5?context=3)  [deleted] I don't laugh at people who are concerned about their student loan debt. Our public schools are a complete and utter failure when it comes to teaching kids how to prepare for college (or even if they should be attending). Parents suck, too, mostly.\n\nI agree that we have to pay for our personal mistakes, even if they were made out of ignorance. That's why I'm paying off debt.\n\nBut it does no good to lecture somebody on the bad choices they've made - just as it does them no good to try and pass off those bad choices onto somebody else.\n\nWhat *really* sucks about our world today is that bad choices are extremely unforgiving. I have student loan debt and a degree that I cannot do much with. I was encouraged by friends, families, and teachers to go ahead with the degree. I didn't understand one thing about business, savings, etc.\n\nI've since learned the \"error of my ways\" (so to speak), and I'm trying to turn things around, but it is enormously difficult in our current economy. Even with marketable skills, which got me my current (extremely low paying) job, no marketable degree hurts.\n\nBasically, my plan right now is to make the best of it, continue working my ass off to get out of this situation, with the full realization that it may never happen. However, *for my kids* (I have two), I am drilling them from a very young age on the dangers of debt (particularly related to one's education), the value of certain degrees, and hopefully we can find a much better way to deal with all of this than I did.\n\nTurning things around will require some people (like me) to accept the responsibility of our mistakes and educate future generations not to make the same ones. It also may require some people (like me) to simply live in (the uniquely and easily livable American form of) poverty for the rest of our lives.\n\nI understand his frustration and I sympathize with him. But not accepting responsibility seems like a really immature reaction.   When did you decide to label yourself and anarchist? Who or what influenced that decision? Sorry this is a link to his AMA over at r/IAmA. [Here it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fi6l/i_am_david_graeber_an_anthropologist_activist/)  Disappointed that a ctrl-f of \"Menger\" didn't find anything.  Where are the Austrians at in that thread?  I'm at work and can't write well at the moment. Could someone rewrite this in a better sounding way and post it for me? \n\n&gt;Seeing as you are a Communist-Anarchist, what is your thoughts on property, communal or no property? Also if you don't believe in state coercive property rights, than do you believe in Intellectual Property or IP? And if you do not, than why don't you put your money where your mouth is, and release your books on the internet for free so everyone can read them? Than the community can decide what compensation you deserve.    I feel stupid and I'm sure I'll have to read his book to get the full answer, but I don't quite understand the implications of the idea that there was debt before money. I mean, so what? I don't see how that would impact or affect future human behavior. Well, the question he tries to get to is that, if the myth has been shown to be unfounded, why do we insist on still telling it? The apparent answer is because the complicated bases on which we actually meet our needs are too messy, and non-exchange oriented, which disrupts the emphasis on markets as the primary economic environment.\n\nBut I think a much more important exposition of the book is of the intimate connection between debt and violence. The discussion of the origins of money, though relevant, was partially an anthropologist's grievance against economists for persisting in an ahistorical founding myth.\n\nEdit: Edited for sensible grammar. &gt; The apparent answer is because the complicated bases on which we actually meet our needs are too messy, and non-exchange oriented, which disrupts the emphasis on markets as the primary economic environment.\n\nCould you maybe expound on this a bit?\n\nI'm beginning to think I need to read the book because I'm not really making connections that other people seem to be making. It may be best to first note that Graeber describes three fundamental types of relationship: communism, exchange, and hierarchy. Communism is so named because it operates on the principle \"to each according to their needs, from each according to their abilities\", and is predominant within families, among friends, or for small favors among strangers. Hierarchy is when one party has power over another; this has the opposite logic, where the more powerful has things done for and given to them by the less powerful. Exchange, on the other hand, at least formally assumes equality between parties, and they attempt to exchange things of roughly equal value by some assessment.\n\nSo the notion I was getting at is that human activity is extremely complicated, and we get our needs and wants satisfied in a number of ways, only some of which operate according to the logic of exchange, whereas economics essentially treats all human interactions as exchange, as exemplified by the market. So I was suggesting that perhaps the reason for the emphasis on the barter myth is because it still follows this logic of exchange as the way basic needs are met, and justifies the preeminence of markets in economic thought.\n\nI really would encourage you to read the book. It's very approachably written for an academic work. It's pretty easy to find a copy by Googling, if you can't justify forking out $15 at the moment, and Graeber is very sympathetic to piracy of his work. ",

    "snippet" : "The answer seems self evident, but would like to hear peoples arguments for both a yes and no answer.\n\nAlso, and perhaps the same question, can aggression exist without ownership?     Can ownership not exist?   &gt; Can ownership not exist?\n\nPersonally, I feel we could show through some form of logic/a scientific approach that ownership exists: it is a natural right/it is a core aspect of existence/etc.\n\nHowever, there does seem to be a % of the population that feel ownership is an arbitrary concept and, as such, can not be justified. Everything from non-violence to theft, ownership, law, property,  the state, justice, morality, violence, and democracy are all abstractions that exist in the minds of actors (humans).\n\nIf one wishes to deny an abstraction on the mere basis that it is an abstraction, the first question I would ask is how they support or justify one of these other abstractions.\n\nIf one denies ALL abstractions, then if one \"enslaves\" or \"assaults\" him is merely just a bunch of atoms moving around. &gt; If one wishes to deny an abstraction on the mere basis that it is an abstraction, the first question I would ask is how they support or justify one of these other abstractions.\n\nThis is the best approach that I've seen so far in this thread. Thank you.\n\n&gt; him is merely just a bunch of atoms moving around.\n\nI've seen this argument used before on reddit. We are only atoms (a lot of other stuff) and therefore there is no self-ownership. As such, rape does not exist. In my opinion, it was a horribly twisted argument. &gt; *\"In my opinion, it was a horribly twisted argument.\"*\n\nSure, it's mostly a half truth.  If rape doesn't exist, then \"murdering a rapist\" is nothing more than atoms rearranging matter that was in a functional biological arrangement.  IMO, that's not actually saying anything relevant to the abstraction of \"human action\" because in that context, humans are just collections of matter and electricity that do whatever they do.\n\nEventually, if this other person finds his own death undesirable, he might decide to actually engage in a conversation about acceptable behaviors and truces where certain actions become impermissible, in exchange for me treating him the same way.\n\nThe use of understanding the \"only matter exists\" perspective is to also understand what abstractions really are, and how appeals to \"it's just atoms\" contradict their use of abstractions.  Persons who usually appeal to this do so when it is convenient for their desired result, but otherwise engage in using other abstractions. Everything from non-violence to theft, ownership, law, property,  the state, justice, morality, violence, and democracy are all abstractions that exist in the minds of actors (humans).\n\nIf one wishes to deny an abstraction on the mere basis that it is an abstraction, the first question I would ask is how they support or justify one of these other abstractions.\n\nIf one denies ALL abstractions, then if one \"enslaves\" or \"assaults\" him is merely just a bunch of atoms moving around. Can ownership not exist?      This is best argument I can think of in favor of this: It is \"unfair\" for someone else to use a nature's resource (particularly if it's finite; like say picking fruit or whatever) without checking with you. Since it's \"unfair\" it is theft.\n\nOtherwise this only makes sense given property rights. He's not stoping you from picking it. He is just doing it first. Right but you can concoct a scenario where that could be \"unfair\", e.g. you and me are on a desert island, the food supply is small, and I appropriate all the food for me or eat it all before rescue. Something like that.\n\nNot saying I agree.  ",

    "title" : "How do you 'bring someone to justice' without a state?",
    "snippet" : "1) How do DROs investigate crimes? Currently, the state uses its monopoly on force to ensure that it can investigate crimes. Without such a monopoly, how could someone suspected of, say, murder possibly investigated? Wouldn't any attempt to search his property for incriminating evidence be a violation of his property rights? Couldn't he just refuse the search, and then what recourse would the victims have?\n\n2) If someone were implicated in a robbery, how could the victim get the suspect to agree to go to binding arbitration? Since Ancapistan is all about voluntary interaction, the robber could just refuse to go to court, or only agree to go to court where is brother is the judge. In either case, what would the victim do? Even if the brother's ruling isn't taken seriously, the victim cannot force the the thief to appear before a 'fair' judge. \n\nAssume for these scenarios that the aggressor does not subscribe to a DRO. And, as for the social ostracism argument, if the bad guy isn't welcome in his community anymore, what prevents him from moving and creating a completely new identity?  I found this video to explain it pretty well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPyrq6SEL0  1. In a totally voluntary society, investigation and arbitration are done with mutual consent from the parties involved.  If mutual consent can not be reached, reputation change/ostracism occurs.  In a 'market law' style AnCap society, the DRO could enforce laws like a state does but with private agencies.\n\n2.  Ostracism.\n\n&gt;And, as for the social ostracism argument, if the bad guy isn't welcome in his community anymore, what prevents him from moving and creating a completely new identity?\n\nFirst of all, to move somewhere you have to be able to get there.  There is no public land in an AnCap society.  Access to things like streets, airlines, busses, trains, sidewalks is done with mutually agreed contracts.  If the people who own the sidewalks (which might be your town, your landlord, or even a DRO) say you can not be on them, and they catch you on them you have violated their property and they can defend it.  If this hypothetical criminal moves and starts a new identity they will have no reputation.  How likely are you to deal with an adult who has no reputation, and no one to vouch for their good behavior or credit-worthiness?  It will certainly be possible (though reputation is much more sticky in the age of the internet than it used to be) but it would not be an easy option.\n\nVoluntarists typically do not believe in retributive justice as valid.  Compensation would occur through a DRO or arbitration.  Failure to compensate a victim would lead to reputation damage and possibly ostracism. &gt; Voluntarists typically do not believe in retributive justice as valid.\n\nI wouldn't consider it \"invalid\", just dumb, like heroin usage. I think (and I am not the only one here or elsewhere to argue this) that retributive justice violates the NAP, which by definition is antithetical to voluntarism. the way I see it, the moment you violate someone's liberty, all bets are off. may be a dick move, but doesn't start down a slippery slope.   &gt;Without such a monopoly, how could someone suspected of, say, murder possibly investigated? \n\nYou don't need a monopoly, you just need respected courts to issue a warrant. What's the difference in everyone saying 'Sure, we'll respect the warrants issued by all of those courts that are under the same organizational structure' and 'Sure, we'll respect the warrants issued by all those courts that aren't under the same organizational structure'? \n\n&gt;Wouldn't any attempt to search his property for incriminating evidence be a violation of his property rights?\n\nHonestly, it'd just be ignored to an extent. If it turns out he's guilty, then no problem, no harm was done. If he's found innocent however he would almost certainly be owed compensation for his time and trouble, unlike today. So while it would technically be temporarily violating his property rights it's done with the understanding that there will be compensation if it turns out the suspicions were wrong. Plus that's assuming the defendant doesn't voluntarily submit the evidence needed to prove his innocence, which innocent people tend to do lol\n\n&gt;If someone were implicated in a robbery, how could the victim get the suspect to agree to go to binding arbitration?\n\nIn the vast majority of cases the person would have agreed to abide by a set of 'laws' in order to reap the benefits of living in society. Things like credit, renting, perhaps driver's license (not really the same, but the equivalent of), would require the person to agree to certain terms, among which would be something along the lines of 'I agree to submit to arbitration in the event I am accused of a crime.' In the few cases where the defendant hadn't done that, they would simply be issued a summons to court and the court would proceed with its investigation with or without them. Assuming they're found guilty, the sentence would be carried out and all the security forces would simply respect the decision of that court. It's the defendant's loss that he decided not to show up.\n\n&gt;And, as for the social ostracism argument, if the bad guy isn't welcome in his community anymore, what prevents him from moving and creating a completely new identity?\n\nNothing, except that people with no history in their reputation would be viewed very very suspiciously. Could it be faked? Sure, but having a state certainly doesn't solve that issue so I'm not really sure that it matters much in a debate about whether a monopolistic court system is needed. &gt;Things like credit, renting, perhaps driver's license (not really the same, but the equivalent of), would require the person to agree to certain terms, among which would be something along the lines of 'I agree to submit to arbitration in the event I am accused of a crime.'\n\nI don't think that businesses would require someone to go to arbitration if they were accused of a crime not related to them or their business. \n\n&gt;Assuming they're found guilty, the sentence would be carried out and all the security forces would simply respect the decision of that court. It's the defendant's loss that he decided not to show up.\n\nAre you suggesting that a court could rule someone guilty and allow a DRO to coerce someone pay a fine? Why don't the DROs just go around making accusations and getting judgments and taking money from people?\n\n&gt;Could it be faked? Sure, but having a state certainly doesn't solve that issue so I'm not really sure that it matters much in a debate about whether a monopolistic court system is needed.\n\nMy social ostracism argument stemmed from my point that since you can't force someone to appear in court and agree to a ruling, the only way to punish them would be through voluntary ostracism. \nI don't think that businesses would necessarily ostracize customers. OJ Simpson, even though public perception is that he is a murder, has lead his life after the trials in society and hasn't been banished into the forest. &gt;I don't think that businesses would require someone to go to arbitration if they were accused of a crime not related to them or their business.\n\nYou're missing the point, it's not about after the fact, it's before. Say you're a bank, and you want to lend money out to someone. You want to make sure that person abides by at least basic rules in society. If they all of a sudden go murdering people, well too bad, you're out of your money cause there's no way you're gettin it back. Basically, they'd only lend to people who had already agreed to abide by a DRO because those without one are a much much higher risk. Plus, why the hell would people not have one? It's ONLY to your benefit. Those DROs are there and exist to *protect you from others* or help you get compensation in the event that someone harms you. Why in the world would you not have one? lol\n\n&gt;Are you suggesting that a court could rule someone guilty and allow a DRO to coerce someone pay a fine?\n\nYes, of course. We have no problem with (and I assume you don't either) getting compensation from a violent aggressor. \n\n&gt;Why don't the DROs just go around making accusations and getting judgments and taking money from people?\n\nand become outlaws? Who the hell is going to respect them and any judgements they make? Any investors they had would instantly pull out for fear of bad press, their shareholders would instantly sell everything they had, their stock price would plummet, they'd lose their customers, they'd be sued out their ass by every other DRO out there. It'd be like the ultimate shitstorm just landed on their front door. They'd disappear overnight and you'd never hear of them again.\n\n&gt;My social ostracism argument stemmed from my point that since you can't force someone to appear in court and agree to a ruling, the only way to punish them would be through voluntary ostracism.\n\nQuite frankly, once you had your ruling it wouldn't really matter whether they 'agreed' to it or not. They would be considered a violent aggressor and action would be taken against them. No different than with a monopolistic court. The only difference in essence (in cases where the defendant refused to abide by a court at least) is that it could be any number of courts that make that ruling rather than just a single one. &gt;Why in the world would you not have one?\n\nBecause I don't. Free society. All that. \n\nHow would the appeals process work?  Restitution is more useful than some abstract sense of \"justice\".  Doesn't answer all of your questions, but just the first thought that came to mind when reading your title.  \n\n\"Justice\" is a notion perpetrated by the state so that it may enrich itself (either through fines, or taxing people to support the ever-expanding system) while convincing the victim the wrong has been righted, even though they remain damaged.  \n\nBob steals your TV...I take it from Bob and punch him in the face.  Justice has been served. Don't you feel better? I totally understand that and agree, I guess I should have used a better word:\nHow do you force someone to pay restitution without a state?

Justice has been served. Don't you feel better?   if someone is refusing a search, or to go court, with enough evidence against them, that defiance could be enough alone for a \"conviction\" and result in an totally voluntary, but still harsh, penalties, such as ostracization from society.\n\nthere would be no way to \"enforce\" this, but it does throw up a gigantic red flag to anyone who might consider signing a contract with such a person, insuring them etc.\n\nthere is only incentives to deal with a voluntary legal system. even if you do fuck up and make a mistake with your life, just that act alone is the first step in redemption in the eyes of society. so, guilty until proven innocent? It's hard for be to believe that businesses are going to forsake a customer because they were accused of a crime.\n\n&gt;enough evidence against them\n\nWhat is \"enough evidence\"? The whole reason that the police conducts searches is that there is some evidence but not enough for a conviction.  &gt; so, guilty until proven innocent? It's hard for be to believe that businesses are going to forsake a customer because they were accused of a crime.\n\nsomeone accused of a crime in a case taken by a reputable court has everything to gain and nothing to lose by cooperating with them. so yes, it seems reasonable to me that people may presume them guilty until proven innocent, if they are not even willing to comply.\n\nthis is just my education estimation of human behavior. I'm not trying to tell anyone how to live.\n\n&gt; What is \"enough evidence\"? \n\n...enough evidence to warrant a search? &gt; someone accused of a crime in a case taken by a reputable court has everything to gain and nothing to lose by cooperating with them. so yes, it seems reasonable to me that people may presume them guilty until proven innocent, if they are not even willing to comply.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of true. Let me ask you, if you are accused of a crime by police and taken to a reputable court (ie. the state's courts, as they are widely considered the only reputable courts around), do you have everything to gain and nothing to lose by fully complying with the police? Would it be perfectly reasonable for me to assume that you are guilty if you are unwilling to fully comply with police? \n\nIf not, why, exactly, would this be different when the court and police are hired and paid for by the person accusing you of a crime? I wouldn't call state courts \"reputable\", so, no.\n\nclear conflicts of interest would be....clear. not complying certainly wouldn't damage one's reputation.\n\nthings are quite wonderful without a monopoly. &gt; I wouldn't call state courts \"reputable\", so, no.\n\nSo the accused is the one making the decisions on which courts are reputable? Well that's awesome, then. The only reputable courts are the ones that find the accused not guilty...\n\nHow about more widely? Do people honour, trust and/or respect the courts? I would say yes. If we went around asking people \"do you trust (or honor, or respect) the courts we have?\" with no other qualifiers, do you think most people would say no? Because I would bet that the vast majority would say yes.\n\nFurthermore, to address your previous point more closely (that an accused has everything to gain and nothing to lose by completely complying with a free market court), let's look at the actual possible outcomes. If the accused complies with the courts, he has an investigation and trial, which will either find him completely innocent, or find him guilty and require him to pay money to the victim (or worse). So, the accused, if he complies, will either be much worse off than before he was accused of a crime, or will be only somewhat worse off (due to the time, money and energy spent fighting a court case). There is absolutely no outcome where the accused is better off (unless maybe he goes through another court case to get reparations for pain and suffering for going through the first court case... spending more time energy and money for dubious outcome). \n\nOn the other hand, if the accused can find a way to not comply with the courts, and get the whole thing dropped, he will be better off, regardless of court outcome. He could even spend some money, time and energy to achieve this end, and still be better off than any court outcome. As such, the accused definitely does not have \"nothing to lose and everything to gain\" by going to court.\n\n&gt; clear conflicts of interest would be....clear. \n\nThat's a meaningless statement. Yes, if I go and loudly proclaim to the world that I am paying this judge to rule this case in my favor, then maybe it would be a clear conflict of interest. If I am more sneaky about it, then it would be less clear. \n\nFurthermore, ALL cases in a free market justice system will have clear conflicts of interest, simply due to market forces. If I want to bring someone to justice, I am the one who has the most interest in getting a good judge. The accused has little incentive to give money to have a court that has a good chance of judging him and requiring him to pay retributions. His ideal outcome is to have no court and have the entire case forgotten. Otherwise, his only incentive to pay for a court is to pay for one that will find him innocent.\n\nNow, the general public may wish to pay for fair and just courts, before they are involved in any cases. However, the typical person has money in short supply, and would be aware that the small amount of money he can spare for fair courts will not make any meaningful impact in getting fairer courts, and thus has no real incentive to give any money for courts. However, once he is involved in the court system, his primary incentives change from wanting fair courts, to wanting courts that will give him his desired outcome, and what he pays for would reflect this.\n\nThus, the only people willing to pay for courts (the accuser and (to a smaller extent) the accused) have massive incentive to get courts that will give them a desired outcome, rather than be purely fair. sorry dude, but you really can't see the forest for the trees can you. I'm just making observations on human behavior. if you find yourself accused of a crime in a free society, go ahead, ignore it and don't comply with the local court system, see how well that works out for you. &gt; I'm just making observations on human behavior. if you find yourself accused of a crime in a free society, go ahead, ignore it and don't comply with the local court system, see how well that works out for you.\n\nSo you do not want to actually discuss your stance? Fair enough. If you change your mind, let me know. As to responding to this statement, I think if I ignored a court in an ancap society, I would either face a mild/moderate inconvenience (if they were strictly adhering to NAP), or a large amount of force (if they did not strictly adhere to the NAP). what do you mean \"my stance\"? I can tell you how I feel on matters. but I can't tell you how the rest of society is going to be. all I can do is make educated estimations. it just seems to me that if society has a favorable view of a court system that is summoning you for a case, you only stand to lose your reputation by refusing. basic logic.",

The reason why unemployment is so high is because lots of people have no problem either retiring early and getting Social Security Disability payments, or being on unemployment for as long as possible in order to avoid working/looking for work.\n\nYour username is /u/buylocal745. I'm assuming you like buying local. So do I, especially for fresh produce. Not sure where you live, but I can almost guarantee you that there are no places near you where you can buy things while walking down a street. It used to be that you could walk anywhere and be greeted with a plethora of goods for sale. Think of the Arab trading markets that existed for centuries, or what Little Italy looked like in NYC around 1900s. Free-trade, and people could sell whatever they wanted.\n\nNow look around. It's all strip malls, big box stores, and older malls. No identity. Everything looks the same. Why? Well, because big corporations lobbied government to get special tax breaks, to get infrastructure paid for them, for eminent domain to force people off their land so Walmart wouldn't have to buy it at a normal price. They subsidize highway construction to cheaply take passengers away from inner cities out to the suburbs. Greedy politicians wanted more taxes and more fees, so now it costs $7,000 to operate a hot-dog stand in Seattle. In New York, it can cost *hundreds of thousands.* Buying a Cab Medallion can cost $1,000,000. This is a result of the Crony-capitalist Government we currently have. Most anarcho-capitalists *hate* corporations, since they're just a legal construct of the Government. Lot's of anarchists don't think about this, but it's true. \n\nIn an ancap world (as well as an anarchist world, since most ancaps like anarchists, even though this gesture isn't returned in kind) there would be no regulations, no taxes or permits. Just people buying/selling/bartering/trading whatever they wanted. Simple as that. Unemployment would drop to near zero, and corporate profits would take a huge nosedive as well. Who would you rather buy soda from, the guy who made it on the street corner, or the huge monolithic corporation that muddles up the whole place with advertising? Nailed it. Curious for OP's response.   crony capitalism. In a free market these companies would be getting killed. \n\nFor example and this is in all seriousness. Tomorrow I would open a distillery and hire 5-6 people. This won't happen because I need a license to make alcohol and then sales are restricted to government stores in my state (I'd want to harness the internet for my sales). Then in terms of the people I would hire, I'd have to do paperwork and apparently now pay some benefits like healthcare and 401k retirement. \n\nWhy do I want this hassle? It's much easier if I just keep my operation to myself. There is no incentive for me to fight through the bureaucracy at my small scale. Without government though, I could be selling very cheap alcohol and paying people to help me. \n\nThats the thing that government regulation does, it stifles competition, especially from the small business owner. Now you might argue that this puts safety levels into place, but you also have to accept that this raises the bar for creating a business.\n\nSo at the end of the day, these fat cat companies have no competition. Coke fights Pepsi, but Bobs (my neighbors) cola isn't even allowed to be on the shelves at the local grocery store. Coke and Pepsi are set for life and they can do no wrong when any mistake they make goes unpunished without competition.

    "title" : "What order is optimal when explaining libertarianism?",
    "snippet" : "When explaining libertarianism, a very common reaction is for people to hastily draw ridiculous conclusions before you even have time to finish explaining. It is often hastily concluded that:\n\n * because libertarians think heroin should be decriminalized, we use and/or support and endorse the use of heroin.\n * because libertarians dont agree with welfare, we are all rich and/or hate the poor and think they should be left to die in the streets.\n * because libertarians think the government has no business regulating consenting adults who want to marry, we hate gays (!) (Ive actually had that one many times, because people assume that just because libertarians do not think churches should be *forced* to marry gays against their consent, that must mean we are against gay marriage)\n\nOnce accusations of this kind has materialized, you are left trying to claw yourself uphill from a moral low ground, and often people will just think whatever you say after that is some shitty rationalization.\n\nIs there an order or way to explain libertarianism that prevents this very annoying and frequently recurring problem?  Start with the NAP. I don't feel the need to explain what that is in this sub.\n\nThen procede to ask them this series of questions:\n\n1) Do you, personally, individually, have the right to initiate force against peaceful others? \n\n2) Do two people have the right to initiate force against peaceful others? \n\n3) Can you delegate a right that you do not have to others?\n\n4)Where does the group of *people* that call themselves government get the right to initiate force?\n I guess starting with the NAP is a very sensible thing to do. Your order is similar to George Ought to Help, which I really like.\n\nBut what do you say to the inevitable counter arguments, that it *is* moral to use force on people who dont want to pay tax, that government is consentual etc? I guess starting with the NAP is a very sensible thing to do. Your order is similar to George Ought to Help, which I really like.\n\nBut what do you say to the inevitable counter arguments, that it *is* moral to use force on people who dont want to pay tax, that government is consentual etc?  I actually like Michael Huemer's method.  He explains his position with three core concepts:\n\n1.  It is wrong for a person to initiate aggression against someone else or their stuff - so no murder, thievery, arson, rape, etc.  (The Non-Aggression Principle.)  Not usually much argument there. \n\n2.  Government uses force/coercion/aggression to achieve its ends.  Regardless of whether you think those ends are the most amazing thing since sliced bread, you can't deny that force is used to accomplish them.\n\n3.  Government does not have any special moral standing as compared to individuals.  So, since individuals can't morally initiate force (see number 1), neither can government.\n\nThat's it.  You'll rarely get argument on number 1, and as long as you focus on the technical truth, rarely on number 2 either.  Where statists or the simply uninformed will argue with you is on number 3.  They will say that government DOES have some special moral right that individuals don't have.\n\nHow do you argue this?\n\nRead this - then you're ready:  http://www.amazon.com/The-Problem-Political-Authority-Examination/dp/1137281650/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359436270&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=huemer\n\nHonestly, read that book.  It's probably the best moral defense of anarchy/libertarianism I've ever read.  It's simple, in layman's terms, and defeats things like the social contract with the awesome power of logic.  I highly recommend everyone read it.  Good luck!  I like to start with property, because it is something that most people already think that they agree with.  Attaching the libertarian banner to your argument immediately throws up mental flags for statists, because they already \"know\" how to defeat your argument; it's been my experience that it is harder to make any headway when the already \"know who you are.\"  But, you can establish the logical connection between the inarguable truth of the Axiom of Human Action to the universal immorality of coercion, it isn't hard to dismantle the basis of their arguments before they can make ludicrous claims.  Hopefully then they will listen to what you have to say.  Even then, don't get discouraged when they still don't listen to you, since they will probably at least secretly acknowledge that their beliefs are contradictory.  I think [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGtcNcyyTI) is very relevant.\n\nhe starts talking about the NAP and how simple it is at around 4:45 Good vid, Ive seen it before. But this is Tom Woods doing exactly what I want to avoid, what I dont want to have to do: trying to claw yourself uphill from a moral low ground, where often people will just think whatever you say is some shitty rationalization. if someone believes that not attacking people is a shitty moral low ground, I don't think you're ever going to get anywhere with them.\n\never.\n\nI'm not saying don't bother, I'm saying that I don't bother. Dont get me wrong, I dont think its a moral low ground but like I said, many will draw some hasty and ridiculous conclusion and then think you have the moral low ground because you use and love heroin. Thats what needs to be avoided.       Simplify, simplify. Start with asserting that libertarianism simply means a belief in minimizing government power (you can get to abolishment later). Explain how government violates individual consent. Resist the urge to compare to rape, they will think it sensationalism and shut down. Explain how corporations do most of their abuse and monopolizing with the aid of government. Ask them, really ask them, what gives government the privilege to do what they do. \n\nSay that you're not against welfare. Say that you're against the source of welfare money. Say that this welfare is an inefficient solution to poverty that's built on a horrible system. The trick with this kind of thing is to use your first sentences to defy their expectations. This will block their instinctual desire to categorize and file away your beliefs. You can then explain yourself fully using roundabout methods.\n\nThe really important thing is to break down the stereotypes in their head. Forget Ron Paul, the constitution, the founding fathers, the guns, the tricorn hats and muskets. Nothing *wrong* with those things, of course, but you want to present it as a philosophical stance and not something they can stereotype, categorize, and file away as \"one of *those* people\". ",

At least government promises to solve perfect murders and they promise to spend all the money in the world to solve the perfect murders.\n\nSo who would solve perfect murders in a free society? What's the guarantee that perfect murders will be taken care of in a free society?  Apparently you care about what happens to such people. I do as well, and (if the frequency with which this comes up can be an indicator) I would think that we could find others. Why don't we get together and put some of our resources into efficiently and effectively providing for these unfortunate people?  Apparently you care about what happens to such people. I do as well, and (if the frequency with which this comes up can be an indicator) I would think that we could find others. Why don't we get together and put some of our resources into efficiently and effectively providing for these unfortunate people?  But how do you know for sure that people would do that? I'm sure a lot of people have extra money currently, but the majority of them don't donate anything. The majority of people actually *do* donate, though often not much. In a free market, people would be relatively wealthier. We also know from statistical data that when taxes go down, donations go up, and vice versa. If tax obligations were zero, and the government had stopped taking care of indigents, then extrapolation would suggest that they would be cared for. That's still not assurance that they'll receive care, but that does give me an idea. Perhaps someone could open a privatized social security type of deal. \n\nYou sign a contract that a percentage of your paycheck will go towards that company, and if you are unable to work or retire, you can get a monthly check. There could be competing companies that offer different packages, rates, etc.  That already exists. It was much more common before the advent of the government's social security, and would be much more common if that were to end. It's amazing what people can do without having to point guns at others. That's still not assurance that they'll receive care, but that does give me an idea.

Well yes, but it just dawned on me that could be used here haha.\n\nBut then again it brings up the question of, what about those people barely making it by that cannot afford insurance. But how do you know for sure that people would do that? I'm sure a lot of people have extra money currently, but the majority of them don't donate anything. Would you donate? Of course everyone is not going to donate. In particular they are likely to not donate to what you think is important. there is simply not ever going to be enough and some needy people are certainly, without a doubt, going to suffer.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism doesn't really solve these kind of problems. We can give ideas of how they might be solved, but there is really no sure-fire way that things will work themselves out. IMO the goal of being an ancap is that whatever we do actually do, we do it without coercive violence. After all, is it really worth ending homelessness or hunger in the world, at the expense of continuous warfare, environmental pollution or no individual freedom? So while we might not have perfect answers, what we do have doesn't hurt anyone. I have a feeling that in an an-cap world, with more emphasis on the individual providing for themselves, there will be a stronger sense of family and community because these will be a safety net.  Nothing surprising here, this is how it has been up until 60-80 years ago, and is like this in much of the developing world today.\n\nYou see multi-generational households where the elderly help take care of the kids while the parents work.  No money wasted on daycare and the grandparents can afford to live without generating income.  You see neighbors helping neighbors and when you get to know your community, you are less likely to take advantage of their good nature and they're less likely to help you if you do.  \n\nWhereas today we have parents paying for daycare, seniors living on their own eating cat food, and kids hardly learning anything in jail like daycare environments.  You have the state dishing out food and money and there's no name or face associated with it... so you take all you can get with no remorse.  It's a sad environment. Would you donate? Of course everyone is not going to donate. In particular they are likely to not donate to what you think is important. there is simply not ever going to be enough and some needy people are certainly, without a doubt, going to suffer.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism doesn't really solve these kind of problems.

It's because there's people who care.\n\n&gt;How about the people that just straight up refuse to work (Although I believe in that case they don't deserve anything)\n\nAs you put it, sloth is a sin after all.  Thanks for the reply, but in the first case I still don't understand how we can be assured that these people receive care. Although you can assume that people will help, that's only an assumption. How can we be assured that people will be able to buy food if we get rid of the government? You can assume that people will produce and sell it, but that's only an assumption.\n       This is an important question, and in answering it we need to keep a couple things in mind.  One of the reasons why people organized and fought to get public assistance is because private charity was generally found quite lacking (rich people don't really donate much of their income to charity), imposed all kinds of conditions on receiving help (the Salvation Army got the name \"starvation army\" because they wouldn't feed you unless you complied with their religious demands) and was often highly exploitative (poor houses, orphanages, for example).  If you want to know more about the failures of free market capitalism in this area, you might also want to look into the armies of the unemployed that emerged in several periods of deep economic crisis.  People marched on the capitals of many cities and even Washington (in some dramatic cases, seizing trains and forcing them to take them where they wanted to go) to make demands for assistance from the government.  This was, as you probably guessed, because the private aid was completely insufficient to the task at hand.  So while the ancap may have some thought experiments about how this will work, we actually have historical precedence to inform us here.  And it is not supportive of their assertions. This isn't true at all. The reason why Government started providing charity was because Teddy Roosevelt decided to start a 'War on Hyphenated-Americans': \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphenated_American\n\nhttp://www.freenation.org/a/f12l3.html Of course, the problem is that you still have to deal with the way that people acted during this time that was equivalent to what you want.  Seems that you cannot.  So let's try to look at this another way.  Where I live, Mexican and Irish workers, organized through an anarchist union (among others) had mutual aid societies.  These provided various benefits (like funeral expenses and sometimes disability for injured/killed workers) that the capitalist didn't want to provide.  Still, these same workers fought to demand those benefits from their bosses.  This isn't a contradiction.  It's just that they knew that their own ability to do this themselves was limited.  Thus they fought to get these benefits from the boss and to increase their wages.  Anyhow, that's the history on this.  Ancaps have some theories, I know, but they are not supported by the history. &gt; Of course, the problem is that you still have to deal with the way that people acted during this time that was equivalent to what you want.\n\nI don't know what that means.\n\n&gt; Where I live, Mexican and Irish workers, organized through an anarchist union (among others) had mutual aid societies\n\nLike the ones I linked to? I have no problems with Mutual Aid societies, I think they're great.\n\n&gt; Thus they fought to get these benefits from the boss and to increase their wages\n\nSo? That's a good thing. In an ancap society, it'd be easier for the workers to make a competing company if they thought they could do it better.\n\n&gt; Ancaps have some theories, I know, but they are not supported by the history.\n\nHuh? [What about the $10 Trillion Black Market economy?](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/28/black_market_global_economy) Well, you have to deal with the way that people resist and live under the system.  I realize your thought experiments are an attempt to dodge that, but in the end you still have to do it.  As for your other point, are you imagining that the black market economy is somehow a free market?  If that's true, then I have seven million people in prison, jails and state supervision that I want to introduce you to.  Also a bunch of no-benfit-having low wage cash workers or \"clock out and keep working so I don't lose my job\" workers you should meet.  Lol.  That's really funny if you think that.  That said, if I entertain your anti-historical assertion that non-state capitalism can even exist, I wouldn't advocate for the workers merely to start their own company -- I would advocate for them to seize the bosses company.  And, of course, this gets to the fact that in fact the ancap vision is just a privatized version of the state.  You can't have commodity production and exchange without state violence.  You just make it a capitalist subscription service.  Which is really funny. &gt; Well, you have to deal with the way that people resist and live under the system\n\nDo you mean the people that are currently reliant upon the State, such as welfare recipients?\n\n&gt; As for your other point, are you imagining that the black market economy is somehow a free market?\n\nIt's unregulated, as long as you don't get caught. \n\n&gt; Also a bunch of no-benfit-having low wage cash workers or \"clock out and keep working so I don't lose my job\" workers you should meet\n\nSo you want the state to enforce higher wages? It'd be much better to just get rid of government so that inflation didn't erode the purchasing power of poor people's money.\n\n&gt; That said, if I entertain your anti-historical assertion that non-state capitalism can even exist\n\nThis is a common argument to make. Just because \"non-state capitalism\" didn't exist, doesn't mean that it can't or won't exist. That's like saying Slavery shouldn't have been outlawed because the economy never worked without it.\n\n&gt; I would advocate for them to seize the bosses company\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; You can't have commodity production and exchange\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt; Which is really funny.\n\nI still have no idea what you're on about. Why not explain what your solution is? Let's go through your response.  First, you have to explain why it was when the systems you prefer were in place that people found them entirely lacking and thus demanded something else.  After all, you want to go back to the system that people viewed as inadequate and a failure.  Also, I see you agree that you were incorrect about your assertion about black markets, so that's good.  You're already heads and shoulders above most ancaps here in terms of reason.  \n\nYou next point is a straw man.  I'm against wages entirely, but I am not against workers forcing higher wages and standards out of either the state or capital.  It doesn't matter to me which one does it.  Forcing a raise from my boss by collective action or imposing a higher minimum wage through the state by mass action -- it's all the same to me.  After that you're basically just conceding that I am right, that there is no historical evidence for anarcho-capitalism, but you still really, really hope that it can happen anyhow.  Fine.  I think that's really silly and unbelievably unlikely given what we actually know about capitalism, markets and states, but you can hold on to that minute counter-factual possibility if it makes you feel better.  \n\nWorkers should seize the means of production because they reproduce it every day with their labor and people deserve to have control over the economic aspects of their life.  Capitalism is just a private dictatorship.  Finally, if you doubt the relationship between commodity production and state violence (by which we mean you are rejecting the available history on the emergence of markets and capitalism), all you have to do to test it is walk into a store and take something without paying.  See what happens. You're awfully combative. I'm not sure why, but i'm interested in learning so I'll tone back the bellicose language in hopes that you do as well. I'm not beholden to any single political philosophy, and am quite open to learning about different ones.\n\n&gt;  First, you have to explain why it was when the systems you prefer were in place that people found them entirely lacking and thus demanded something else\n\nI already responded to this. The people were coerced by Progressives into changing everything in the name of the \"War on Hyphenated Americans.\" It was Coercion and propaganda, not a problem with anything based in reality. It was political fiction in order to garner votes and support for the WW1 Effort.\n\n&gt; Forcing a raise from my boss by collective action or imposing a higher minimum wage through the state by mass action -- it's all the same to me. \n\nThat's a problem, because if the State gets too powerful by helping the Unions, it's going to put everyone out of work. See what happened in Detroit and why all the jobs have moved to China or the Southern United States.\n\n&gt; After that you're basically just conceding that I am right, that there is no historical evidence for anarcho-capitalism, but you still really, really hope that it can happen anyhow.\n\nYeah, exactly. But I proved that this doesn't matter because Slavery was abolished even though it never was prior to that. Same can be said about the State. By your logic, we shouldn't invent iPhones because they were never invented before. You have to innovate and try new things, and I think we should be able to try out Anarcho-capitalism. If it fails, then we can switch to something else. Maybe Anarchism really is better, who knows? I'm not interested in debating which one will be better in theory, I'm interested in having the ability to try it out.\n\n&gt; Fine. I think that's really silly and unbelievably unlikely given what we actually know about capitalism, markets and states, but you can hold on to that minute counter-factual possibility if it makes you feel better. \n\nThe odds of Ancap happening on a widescale are just the same as Anarchism happening on a widescale. Why are you so certain that you're correct? I wish we could just work together and learn from each other (ancap and anarchism, that is). Then figure out the details when they have a chance of being implemented.\n\n&gt; Workers should seize the means of production because they reproduce it every day with their labor and people deserve to have control over the economic aspects of their life\n\nThey can. It's called stock ownership. If you want to 'seize the means of production' for yourself, start buying shares in the company you own. You'll have nothing to eat, but at least you'll partly 'own the means of production,' which you seem to think is more important than anything else. \n\nI'd counter that owning shares of a company is *much better* than just owning TMoP in one company, since this way you can diversify your portfolio, trade your shares, and have more freedom. Sure, you can't just go into a factory and build an iPhone, but that's because there are almost zero industries where one person can produce a single product by themselves. Even pencils or Legos require teams of people and tons of specialized technical equipment. It's not like there's one machine that makes a car; it's a whole supply chain that spans the globe. Owning TMoP is an anachronism from a simpler time, when people made nails or hammers by hand with a fire and anvil.\n\n&gt; Capitalism is just a private dictatorship\n\nYeah, which is why we're anarcho-capitalists. We hate state-capitalism too, and prefer free-market capitalism. If you don't like one company, you can easily move to one down the road. Or, you can start your own business doing whatever you want. Anarcho-capitalists don't have a preference for either. Most favor the ability to start small businesses, which is why we rally against the Corporate-Government Complex that creates Crony-capitalism.\n\n&gt; Finally, if you doubt the relationship between commodity production and state violence (by which we mean you are rejecting the available history on the emergence of markets and capitalism), all you have to do to test it is walk into a store and take something without paying. See what happens.\n\nI don't understand this point. As an aside, I walk around stores all the time to get things for free by engaging in /r/dumpsterdiving.\n\nLook, I know we have differences, but that doesn't mean that we can't engage in civil conversation. I've tried greatly to understand why /r/anarchism doesn't like ancaps, and I haven't been able to find a good answer yet. From what I can tell, both of our philosophies are compatible in the absence of a Government, and we should let people decide where they want to live when we get to that point. Essentially this just comes down to you theorizing about what could be.  As I said, we have actual facts that we can use here.  Ancaps don't like that because there is nothing in the historical record that says that anarcho-capitalism can exist.  Indeed, capitalists themselves don't seem to think that it exists.  This is quite problematic for your position.  There are a lot of reasons why anarchists don't like ancaps, but a big part of it is the way that ancaps are trying to poach anarchism (with backing from wealthy people, btw).  And, essentially, ancap politics are reactionary in practice.  If ancaps want to reject the available evidence and remain ancaps, they should call themselves anti-state capitalists.  It makes more sense.  Attaching yourselves to anarchism is disingenuous. This is an important question, and in answering it we need to keep a couple things in mind.  One of the reasons why people organized and fought to get public assistance is because private charity was generally found quite lacking (rich people don't really donate much of their income to charity), imposed all kinds of conditions on receiving help (the Salvation Army got the name \"starvation army\" because they wouldn't feed you unless you complied with their religious demands) and was often highly exploitative (poor houses, orphanages, for example).  If you want to know more about the failures of free market capitalism in this area, you might also want to look into the armies of the unemployed that emerged in several periods of deep economic crisis.  People marched on the capitals of many cities and even Washington (in some dramatic cases, seizing trains and forcing them to take them where they wanted to go) to make demands for assistance from the government.  This was, as you probably guessed, because the private aid was completely insufficient to the task at hand.  So while the ancap may have some thought experiments about how this will work, we actually have historical precedence to inform us here.  And it is not supportive of their assertions. &gt; If you want to know more about the *failures of free market capitalism* in this area, you might also want to look into the armies of the unemployed that emerged in several *periods of deep economic crisis*.\n\nSo these economic crisis happened in free-market capitalism? Care to give an example please?\n\n&gt; This was, as you probably guessed, because the private aid was completely insufficient to the task at hand.\n\nI'm also intrigued how is it that during a *deep economic crisis* you expect private charities to function...\n\n&gt; . . . we actually have historical precedence to inform us here.\n\nIt's not a precedent if it's not under free-market capitalism. Free market for labor, pretty much a free hand for capital.  That's what is important.  Naturally, like all capitalists, the bosses were backed up by the state, thus requiring mass action by workers and the poor to overcome them, but that's just par for the course with capitalism. &gt; Free market for labor\n\nUnregulated, free-transit labor?\n\n&gt; pretty much a free hand for capital\n\nState independent alternative currencies? Free from taxation transactions? \n\n&gt; That's what is important.\n\n**Not** if you want to apply its causality to *free-market capitalism*.\n\n&gt; Naturally, like *all capitalists*, the bosses were backed up by the state\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about... [/r/Anarchism is over here](/r/Anarchism) So again, we see just how easy it is for me to win an argument on /r/anarcho_capitalism simply by citing history.  It always cracks me up how y'all have absolutely no historical citations on your side and yet you're so fucking arrogant.  Your whole defense essentially comes down to you saying that history is a lie and just asserting that you're somehow still right.  It's never free market capitalist enough and yet you are so sure that despite that you hold the true faith.  It cracks me up every time.  Lol.  However, I do agree with your point that ancaps are not actual anarchists.  We at least have common ground there. &gt;we see just how easy it is for me to win an argument on /r/anarcho_capitalism by citing history.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;yet you're so fucking arrogant. Here's an ancap's version of an argument: tell a story about two guys on an island and then get mad when the other side asks for evidence of this thing.  Naturally, there is none to give, and with their origin myth in doubt the ancap calls the other person a name to feel better about themselves.  So, if you demand evidence you are \"ignorant\".  But if you believe in two guys on an island and can't defend it with evidence then you're brilliant.  Lol! I'm not going to argue with you. You are set in your convictions, and will hold to your preconceived paradigms no matter what I say. I did not intend any malice, I merely was trying to point out the insincerity of your posts. So again, we see just how easy it is for me to win an argument on /r/anarcho_capitalism simply by citing history.  It always cracks me up how y'all have absolutely no historical citations on your side and yet you're so fucking arrogant.

However, I do agree with your point that ancaps are not actual anarchists.  We at least have common ground there. &gt; y'all have absolutely no historical citations on your side\n\nWe have just as much as any anarchist, we are just as critical towards the State, that which you declare *essential* for capitalism to exist. \n\nWe don't think so, agorism and black markets **prove** there can be capitalist economy without State intervention.\n\n&gt; saying that history is a lie and just asserting that you're somehow still right.\n\nAll I'm saying is that if the State is involved it is not free-market capitalism, you don't seem to be able to grasp that concept though... \n\n&gt; It's never free market capitalist enough and yet you are so sure that despite that you hold the true faith.\n\nAt least our philosophy is voluntary and is built on individual natural rights, under our dogma you can have your *virtuous* society as long as you don't try to coerce us into it.\n\n&gt; I do agree with your point that ancaps are not actual anarchists.\n\nActual anarchists as in authoritarian, collective, syndicalist, etc. No. We do advocate against a State holding a monopoly on force. Hence anarcho-capitalism. Capitalism requires the state.  Indeed markets emerged out of the state.  And capitalism itself came out of a bloody state-directed attack on peasants and defense of commodity production.  Them's the facts.  I get that you don't like it, but that really is of little consequence.  As for your claim that \"if the State is involved it is not free-market capitalism\" I actually agree, because free market capitalism has never, ever existed and never, ever will.  What we have is capitalism, as it always has been, dependent on the state to exist.  I think you just made a powerful breakthrough here.  Congratulations. &gt; Capitalism requires the state.\n\n&gt; . . . free market capitalism has never, ever existed and never, ever will.\n\nGotcha comrade This is an important question, and in answering it we need to keep a couple things in mind.

    "snippet" : "There seems to be some who try to avoid associating and interacting with statists. Can someone list reasons why this is desirable or useful? I fail to see any real benefit in doing so, both in a personal sense and political sense.\n\n * Most of us were statists at some point in the past. I was.\n * Statists are statists because theyve been brainwashed since an early age, and statism is all theyve ever known. Sure, some statists have been exposed to non-statist ideas, but with all the brainwashing and social pressure, isnt it a bit harsh to judge them for being statist?\n * If we dont maintain healthy relationships with statists, how are we going to expose them to non-statist ideas?\n * Even statists with wildly differing views on things can still overlook their differences because they enjoy associating and interacting with each other for other reasons. Youll find it hard to do sports, hobbies or even get a job or an apartment, have friends or a partner, etc etc etc if you insist on not associating and interacting with statists.\n * If you really do avoid associating and interacting with statists, what possible benefit could you gain? Or the movement? IMHO its quite likely that all it will do is make you miserable and make you become and be looked upon as some loner, culty, nerd-weirdo. No one will want to touch you or your ideas with a 10-foot pole.\n\nOn a side note: I also noticed some liberty oriented people have very condesending and elitist views of statists, though they dont necessarily go so far as to avoid associating and interacting with them. Again, what do you or the movement gain from this? You will most likely just be looked upon as an arrogant dick, and make enemies of the liberty movement rather than introducing people to it in a friendly manner. Take a look at e.g. David Friedman, Ron Paul or any other famous libertarian, do you think they could have opened the eyes of so many people if they refused to deal with and e.g. have lectures for statists, and were arrogant, elitist dicks if they ever did?\n\nOf course it doesnt hurt having liberty oriented friends (I for one have very few, and they are more acquaintances than friends, would love to have more) but yeah, I dont see the need for isolating yourself and/or being an asshole.  &gt;If we dont maintain healthy relationships with statists, how are we going to expose them to non-statist ideas?\n\nThis is probably the most relevant point to that recent post.  I think the majority of Ancaps in that thread correctly pointed out that the complainer was failing at creating and maintaining healthy relationships.  If I'm not mistaken, he even agreed.\n\nI think with very little thought it is clear that you should try and have healthy relationships with anyone and everyone you meet!  I don't believe in 'organic food' malarkey, but I won't NOT hang out with someone just because I disagree with them on it.  Same with statism. Also, doesn't it just support the narrative that \"anarchists\" are just part of a radical sub group that aren't apart of \"normal\" society. This makes it really easy to write An Cap off as a \"fringe\" philosophy only adhered to by unknown radicals. \n\nJust my thoughts as an American Statist  (moderate) Democrat who finds the philosophical discussions on this sub fascinating. Even though I stand for what you guys despise (or hate). &gt;If we dont maintain healthy relationships with statists, how are we going to expose them to non-statist ideas?\n\nThis is probably the most relevant point to that recent post.  I think the majority of Ancaps in that thread correctly pointed out that the complainer was failing at creating and maintaining healthy relationships.

I don't believe in 'organic food' malarkey, but I won't NOT hang out with someone just because I disagree with them on it.  Same with statism.  I just get weary explaining the same simple ideas over and over again. \n\nImagine trying to sell this new product that is completely counter to anything anyone has ever seen before. In fact, another product already takes up 100% of the market share and it's a fixed market. The amount of education that would go in to teaching the consumer why the product is useful is astounding.\n\nI avoid interacting with statists because they make me weary. I imagine it's like an atheist living at a theists' retreat. \n\nI'm not interested in saving anyone's 'soul'. I don't care if they are statists, I just want to be left alone. The best way I see that happening is by making as much money as I possible can. In our world, money = freedom. In a way, I consider this leading by example for any statist smart enough to pull themselves up. Why do you feel the need to explain yourself, or even let others know that you arent a statist? Do all you friends insist on explaining and converting you to their ideological or philosophical views? Great question. \n\nI usually don't open with \"I'm an anarchist.\" Also, I'm pretty good at having a discussion with members on both sides and finding value in what they say or just re-parsing what they say back to them. \n\nI live and work near a college campus. Activism from the left is pretty common here. In-so-much as the local socialist candidate held events here through the elect season. I am more than guilty of \"Are you registered to vote?\" \"No I don't support violence or theft.\"\n\nThose kinds of things attract attention, especially from friends. It's mostly curiousity. I've noticed that people either think it means I'm a Socialist/Syndacalist(sp?) or that I participate in Black Bloc or whatever that violence nonsense is. So when I start to explain NAP, voluntarism and markets to people it really is something radically different than what they are used to. Perhaps I'm a poor teacher or lack the communication skill but in my experience those are tough things to grasp.\n\nTLDR: I'm just a super interesting guy and people are dying to know more =)   Every ideology is first developed by great thinkers.\n\nThen they are understood by intellectuals\n\nThen they are massified and vulgarized\n\nThen they are adopted by the people\n\nThen we win\n\nWe're still in phase two, slowly moving to phase three How many living intellectuals do you see within the AnCap movement at the moment?  does ben bernake count? no. Every ideology is first developed by great thinkers.\n\nThen they are understood by intellectuals\n\nThen they are massified and vulgarized\n\nThen they are adopted by the people\n\nThen we win\n\nWe're still in phase two, slowly moving to phase three your average intellectual ie professors and the so called experts are usually the most corrupt and enemies of an cap.  Then why does so much an-cap and libertarian thinking come out of University campuses?  Then why does so much an-cap and libertarian thinking come out of University campuses?  does it? most universitites i know are just crammed with postmodernist socialists. Well *yeah*, but that doesn't invalidate the an-caps that *do* trickle out, like myself. :)  Well I did too. The postmodernism and socialist slant at Uni heavily contributed to me becoming a libertarian. But I cant say that Uni are to credit for that in any formal sense. Is that the case with you? Certainly, by opening my small town existence to a much wider reality.  So you actually had libertarian student fraternities and libertarian professors and stuff? No on the fraternities, yes on the professors.   I myself would probably be considered a statist (at least by mark levins definition in *liberty and tyranny*).  One of my roommates, and great friends I should add, is a libertarian and introduced me to this subreddit.  \n\nWe get along just fine - we both understand that we have different social, economic, and political ideologies.  We talk about political issues quite often in fact - if you never challenge your beliefs you never grow after all - but none of that matters.  It doesn't define us as individuals.  We're good friends who enjoy hanging out and and our opinion on Keynesian economics isn't about to change that.\n\nTL;DR people are still people and you should treat them just the same - if you have common interest you can develop a friendship and it will be a lot easier to talk about political/economic/social issues.  in my opinion there is no hope for them to understand how evil the state is. they have,  nay they deserve to learn the hard way.         What I'm getting from your post is that  there are no slightly valid arguments for the state and therefore all statists are brainwashed sheeple.    * You need to maintain interactions with statists to do any professional networking of consequence.\n* You may become poor at argumentation if you spend all your time among people who agree with you.\n* You'll not understand what the opposition values, so you'll struggle to formulate effective methods to persuade their audience to our cause.\n* You'll cut yourself off from the majority of possible relationships, which can be valuable for all kinds of reasons.\n* Being a liberty-hermit isn't pleasant or effective. \n* You'll become more accustomed to negotiating differences between people. If you want to persuade statists to empathize with your position, you should be capable of also empathizing with them and understanding their beliefs, however irrational they may be.\n\nThat you go. You don't have to be best friends forever with all statists always. Being an ancap doesn't have to mean being part of an esoteric religion that shuns outsiders. Down that path lies becoming like the Shakers without even being known for making good furniture.\n\nYes, it's hard. Yes, it's scary. But if you wanna win, you've gotta do some of the lifting. I like! One thing, I would call them people (albeit with statist views) rather than \"opposition.\" IMHO Using the language of political allegiance is falling victim to the trappings of statism. Point taken. I meant the 'opposition' more as the state itself and its leading advocates. I didn't mean that as your typical person with statist beliefs.",

My plan for 2013 is to put some into these companies (like Amazon and Google) but keep the rest for smaller innovative small-cap companies. I'm also considering buying more gold/silver.\n\nNot sure if this is the best strategy, but most people seemed to think it was okay, as long as I got back into the market. Why not just run a trailing stop? Genuinely curious. Just because it's a bubble (it's always a bubble) doesn't mean that you need to cut profits short. Agreed.

I hope that government interference in the market will be eliminated at some point, so I never want to add new government regulations -- these are just more laws to get rid of later. But hypothetically if I assume that government interference will never be reduced, is net neutrality a good policy? I tend to think that it's not. There's still *some* competition between ISPs, and it's not *impossible* to create an ISP. ISPs aren't going to engage in a lot of controversial censorship. Net neutrality would increase costs and make competition even more difficult because new ISPs would have to understand net neutrality laws and maybe get additional licenses. So I don't think that net neutrality would be worth the potential gains. Aside from the moral issues with using state violence to force people to do anything, it gives the (incompetent, evil, untrustworthy) government more control over the Internet and it ignores the fact that certain Internet traffic *is* more costly.\n\nISPs are free to censor, but they're likely to lose a lot of customers if they do.\n\n&gt; I know most people around Reddit are against it\n\nMost people in this subreddit, but most redditors in general support it because it sounds good and they don't really think about it. So we're ethically in favor of it but politically against it for being an unnecessary regulation?\n\nKinda like we're morally against tobacco but politically in favor of it? Yeah, kind of. Though there are also reasons to delay or block certain content that are totally ethical. For example, BitTorrent traffic is less important than email traffic, so it should have lower priority. And if an ISP doesn't want BitTorrent traffic on their network for whatever reason, they can ban it entirely. There's nothing ethically wrong with this as long as the ISP is open about it. I would consider it somewhat unethical to block or slow down a competitor's website. Maybe it would be unethical to censor certain political ideas that you don't like (though this is a matter of opinion). It's not right to use violence to stop the ISP from doing this, though. And if you don't mind the censorship, you can probably get cheaper Internet service because the censoring ISP will need to charge less to stay competitive with non-censoring ISPs. Yeah, kind of.

If you don't mind me asking, what's so bad about net neutrality? I know most people around Reddit are against it, but reading the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality), I seem to see only good things related to it... Anti-censorship, mainly, and also equality for users.\n\nI also remember back when the law passed in my country, people were in favor of it in general, and back then I also remember it being a good thing.
