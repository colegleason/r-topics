Perks of the job, included your own country, free accommodation and a car(some popemobile model I never heard off, but what the hell it comes with the job)\n\nI went online to try and find where to send my CV, and it turns out that they are not accepting applications.  Instead of the standard Irish job application process, in sending your CV and then your Uncle who knows somebody putting in a good word for you, they have some weird foreign process....\n\nAfter a bit of research I found out who gets the job will be decided by 118 auld fellas who will be locked, or locked in or something, and you can't even get an interview in front of them.  Worst of all, none of my Uncles know any of them, not even some bloke call Brady who lives in Armagh.\n\nI thought I was well scuppered, when I remember this educational DVD I have, something about good parenting (No idea why I have it, it's not as if I have any children).  It included a section on \"How to make an offer he cannot refuse.\"\n\nI found the DVD to watch and learn how to persuade these 118 auld fellas to give me the job.  It appears the throwing a bit of horse meat on their bed is the best method.\n\nI am sure, you have figured out where this is going now.  I popped into my local Tesco, only to find out they can't sell me horse meat after the Department of Agriculture stuck their bloody interfering nose in!\n\nI have racked my brain but still have no idea how to put my name forward for the new job.\n\nHow is the country going move forward if our own fecking Government is block us getting jobs???\n\nSome bloke at work said the good parenting III dvd has some help on how to do things in the Vatican, but I have not looked that up yet.\n\nIf any of you have any suggestions I would appreciate the help.\n\n  Ha, very good.\n\nI know a fellow who knows a fellow, who's uncle is the door man of the place where the auld fellows are locked in, I will tell him to put a word in for you.  Sorry lad, I've taken that post.\n\nMy uncle is Jesus. Fair play to you lad....\n\nIf Jesus was your uncle, I assume you are of a certain age.\n\nCan you name me as your successor?  If you do that you would be a saint and I will name you as such if I can when I take over. \n\nMaking me Pope is surely a miraculous act so you would be a shoo in...

CEO of a multinational company listed on the NASDAQ. Oh wait..... that's someone else....   Good luck in your mocks, I have the upmost faith in you.\n\nThe weather? Feck it, you'll be grand. ...But, how am I supposed to get out of bed tomorrow morning if its still like this? \n\n\nYour sendings of luck are much appreciated and well needed. I just want to melt into my duvet. Taking back what I said about the weather. The ariel had fallen down and is hitting the roof at the moment and my bedroom window seems to be creaking. \n\n My lights are blinking. \n\n\n\n\nI am sleeping in fear.  Our light are doing the same. I'm schcared. The telly is skipping like a mad yoke too.  Turn it off. Telly is only pretending, he wants to be cool like the lights.  Galway is diabolical, [everytime I try to go outside...](http://i.minus.com/iHRt8JDFTc3pk.gif)  Haha mocks. Fuck that. I'm saving my prayers to satan for something important. Good man. They might come in use. Good luck anyway. You'll be grand. I hear the exams down there involve colouring in and wordsearches.  English Paper 1 I'm guessing. You'll be grand, just bullshit your way through it. It's only the mocks. The most annoying part is waiting for your results. Nah, it's not following the pattern of the LC at all! I've German tomorrow... I think. \n\n\nBe grand. (Ps. I don't \"bullshit\" anything ;) English is all about bullshitting though.\n\nAh German, never did it, I did OL French so it was one of the nicer exams. I'm a straight A English student. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll keep at it.\n\n\n\nI regret not doing French. Tres sexy. [Yeah but once you can say this your grand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQa7SvVCdZk)\n\nOh fuck that thunder!I see why you're scared. That and a whole lot more of French filth ;)\n\n\n\nI need a thunder buddy.  :( [Fuck you thunder, you can suck my dick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVb2vkfw6bw)\n\nI'll be your thunder buddy :) Yay, thunder buddies! How did it go? English is all about bullshitting though.\n\nAh German, never did it, I did OL French so it was one of the nicer exams. I got an NG on my LC for German, all I wrote on the exam paper was my name. My folks were none to happy at paying IR\u00a375 for me to get my Matric to get into UCD. What you used to have to write your name??  \n\nWhat's the Matric? I tried Googling it but I was just finding llinks to some New Zealand exam. In ye ancient olden times of yore we had to write our names and answer questions on parchment using a quill and ink. 'Twas before anonymous student numbers you young'uns have now. It was also the era of corporal punishment 'for your own good'. I got thumped the odd time but I was wise and smart enough to avoid it mostly. I saw some serious violent shit in my time in school.\n\nThe 'Matric' was/is(?) the Matriculation exam for universities. You'd get it automatically if you passed all your LC exams. I didn't, hence the IR\u00a375, which was a fortune back in '85. Ah yeah my auld wan is always going on about how the nuns used to slap her wrists and palms with a ruler if she took too long bringing the coal in from the shed back when she was a babby.\n\nI think that still exists?Not sure, but it sounds familiar.  Your Mam got off easy. I have a horror story to tell from when I was ~7 years of age. Thinking back on the incident now still traumatises me.  You are a girl and should be fine.\n\nWhen I was a lad a friend of mine got the mocks and his glands swelled up very painfully and he had to stay in a dark room.\n\n Ice and heat, ice and heat.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/17l9l7/the_weather_is_scaring_me/", "id": 44, "title": "The weather is scaring me..."}, {"snippet": "What is wrong with the man, who volunteers to go to Kilkenny?

But I'm dealing with it in the healthy Irish way. Silently seething with hatred.\n\nEverything's bollocks. Enda Kenny is a system of wood blocks connected by well oiled hinges and manipulated carefully through a sequence of strings. David Cameron as well. They're all wood.\n\nNorthern Ireland's shite.\n\nWeather's shite.\n\nI've no real job so I have to work for my da for peanuts a day.\n\nI live in the backarse of nowhere.\n\nUniversities are too slow sending me offers.\n\nI don't know where my life is going, but I'd quite like to end it in a brawl with someone.\n\nI have no friends, but I do have a lot of people who like to pretend they're my friends in order to get things off me.\n\nI'd like to be a soldier, but the only armed forces I can join are Brits. Feckin' Brits.\n\n\nMy best friend's a woman, but she's met some bollocks and I'm that jealous a knobhead I can't get past the fact she's seeing someone. I don't even understand why I'm jealous. Also she lives in another country. Bollocks.\n\nI can't get drunk without whinging about my problems. \n\nWorst of all, I know all my problems are insignificant as christ, and I still can't get over them.\n\nSo aye. Beat that there. \n\n  This...this *beautiful* rant right here...*this* is why these very halls of Irish misery were constructed. I would make you a personalised flair if I wasn't completely hammered out of my trousers.\n\nWe that are here to piss and moan *Salute You*! *To complain and serve.*  If you're interested in a military career you could always join the [French Foreign Legion](http://www.legion-recrute.com/en/) though:\n\n&gt; If your candidature is upheld, the first contract is minimum for 5 years\n\nI've met quite a few Irish Legionnaires and they're really sound blokes.  Thanks, but I've already considered the FFL, and I've weighed it up against the Royal Marines, but they just don't come out on top.\n\nI want to get my degree before I commit a chunk of my life to military service, so I might as well use it to apply to become an officer, rather than enlist. Better pay, and the Brits will give me a bursary for part of my student loan. Also, the RM new officers minimum commitment is only three years, so if it turns out to be a balls then I won't have wasted too much time.\n\nPlus it's harder to get in, so if I do make it through application and training then I'll have a serious sense of achievement. What would your mammy say about you running of and joining the British army? Navy, actually, and she's probably be none to amused, but I don't care. Tut tut Meh. I'll be 22 by the time I apply, I think my mammy will just be glad I'm not moving back in with her. \n\nAs for the fact that it's the Brits... I don't really mind. As long as it's not the parachute regiment. If anything I'm following in the footsteps of a ton of republicans. Tom Barry was in the British expeditionary force in Mesopotamia. James Connolly fought in the British Army. It's not a big deal for me.\n\n No no no all British people are oppressive tyrants whose very existence is consumed by the need to rape and pillage our lands. Didn't you do history in school?  I think most of the top half of your comment would apply to most people our age.\n\n&gt;My best friend's a woman, but she's met some bollocks and I'm that jealous a knobhead I can't get past the fact she's seeing someone. I don't even understand why I'm jealous\n\nHave you considered the fact that you might have feelings for her?\n\n&gt;I can't get drunk without whinging about my problems.\n\nAgain that's most people.\n\n&gt;I have no friends, but I do have a lot of people who like to pretend they're my friends in order to get things off me.\n\nI know that feel bro. I have feelings, but they're going nowhere. It would never work out. I'd much prefer to keep my one decent friend. One who doesn't take my weed.\n\n\n\n Well being in another country would make that hard to do. You need to start saying you don't have any, everyone knows that. Aye, but I'm so generous when I'm drunk. Sometimes when I'm drunk I buy a bag of chips and just walk around feeding them to strangers. I just want to help people...\n\nThen I wake up poor and angry. I think you're just describing me at this point. Also I keep making people dinner and sandwiches, sober like, just want them to appreciate me :( Why don't people love us?\n\nSeriously... I buy rounds, bring the bag, I drag them out of fights, I make sure they get into taxis when they're covered in their own boke...\n\nYet at the end of the night it's always me wondering why I even bothered. I don't know, for me I think they used to like me and now they just *put up* with me, and reap the benefits of being my friends. I mean the people in college are grand, sure they let me cook dinner but they'll always return the favour but at home...No idk what changed but I constantly just feel like no one could give a shit if I was there or not. Sorry... I just... this is really weird. That's exactly how I feel.\n\nI didn't go to uni with everyone else, so I've basically become estranged from all my friends, but occasionally they come back, and although they're friendly and nice and all, I really feel like either they don't want me there or they don't care I'm there at all.\n\nIt sucks, because they have their new friends, but I have no one. So I end up trying to fill in the gaps with 'imaginary' friendships on the internet. I get deeply involved in my little subreddits, and for a while it feels like I really belong again, sharing the inside jokes, talking about things people outside those communities wouldn't understand, but at the end of the night I'm still lying in bed wondering how it all got so... pathetic.\n\nProbably why I'm avoiding lying in bed.\n\nPart of it is the rural thing. People talk about rural isolation and suicide like it's something that only happens to older people who can't go outside anymore. I'm 19 years old, not some old man from Kerry.  It's a horrible feeling, thinking people would just be happier if you stopped talking to them. The thing is I would understand if this happened when we all went off to college but this started like a year ago out of nowhere. It's like I did something to piss everyone off but no one told me what. \n\nYou avoid going to bed, I avoid getting out of it. You're never a loser in your dreams. Or at least you can try and pretend your life isn't falling to pieces. \n\nI'm not rurally isolated, just socially. But yeah I get that living in the back arse of nowhere would be hard. \n\nMain thing for YOU to remember is you'll be off to college next year, you can make all these new friends then.  The Roid rage is what spurned Lance Armstrong on to win 7 Tours de France and a place on the couch with Oprah but it can get out of control.\n\nFor gods sake lad , give the steroids up, you dont even own a bike.\n\n If there's one thing I've learned from Lance Armstrong, it's that taking drugs will make you famous, no matter how little anyone cares about your sport.  I think I love you. \n\n\n'Sall. I'll just casually continue about my day. Chin up love, it could be worse. You could be from Kerry. I swear to god, the next person who falls in love with me is getting a slap. ...a slap where?! ;)\n\n\nThis is the decider. Augh. *hugs*   In fairness these problems of yours are pretty first world, which is ironic as you have Cork for your flair. EDIT; my mistake, you're a Derry man, which as of the last couple of weeks, as everybody knows, is one of the cultural capitals of the western world. \n\nEdit: I thought this was a different thread.\n\nYeah Derry is nice and all. Not a job in it though.\n\n\n\n You could always just move down the road to Strabane.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/17ee1m/im_filled_with_rage/", "id": 47, "title": "I'm filled with rage"}, {"snippet": "  It'll pass.
