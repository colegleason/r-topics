Treating a stroke is all about restoring bloodflow to the affected area of the brain as rapidly as possible - even ten minutes can make a difference, so having it go unnoticed for an entire class could be deadly.\n\n* Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg - especially on one side of the body.\n\n* Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination. \n\n* Sudden severe headache with no known cause.\n\n* Aaphasia: sudden and extreme language impairment. Often (but not always) involves a mixing-up of words: a person trying to say, \"I feel weird\" might speak the words \"Red lick spaceship.\" It works the other way, too - they might speak clearly but suddenly lose their ability to understand speech.\n\n* Sudden slurring of speech\n\n* Sudden and severe nausea\n\n* Sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes\n\nIf someone around you starts exhibiting any of these symptoms, **CALL 911,** clear a path to the door for the EMTs, ~~and if possible, give the victim aspirin and get them to chew it.  Make sure that you tell the EMTs that you did so.~~\n\nI know this post may seem random, but you literally might save someone's life by knowing how to react.\n", "saved": false, "id": "15rgf2", "clicked": false, "title": "Can you recognize a stroke when you see it?", "num_comments": 13, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 3, "link_id": "t3_15rgf2", "children": [], "author": "CJS7070", "id": "c7p4qhi", "parent_id": "t3_15rgf2", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 8, "body": "FAST is the mnemonic that a lot of people remember it by - **F**ace, **A**rms, **S**peech, **T**ime.

I&amp;#39;m not sure how lecture/discussion goes in the UK but here the key to getting the most out of your courses is going up to your professors and getting to know them, showing them your own interest in their subject and they will certainly reciprocate. In fact I had a student from the UK in one of my last history courses and on more than one occasion I witnessed the prof having a really in depth discussion with him about where he was from, what he was interested in academically, etc. I always found professor Micale&amp;#39;s classes for 200-300 level HST courses to be really well done. I&amp;#39;m not sure his classes correspond with your interests but he is a fantastic lecturer and great professor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also search faculty on the history department website to get a feel for different prof&amp;#39;s areas of research and instruction. \n&lt;a href=\"http://www.history.illinois.edu/people/\"&gt;http://www.history.illinois.edu/people/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, not sure if there is something like this in the UK but in the US you&amp;#39;re a fool if you don&amp;#39;t check ratemyprofessors before selecting courses and profs. \n&lt;a href=\"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/SelectTeacher.jsp?sid=1112\"&gt;http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/SelectTeacher.jsp?sid=1112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!
