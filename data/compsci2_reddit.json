Once you're at that phase, there's two basic categories that you should research:\n\n1) The entire stack of how a compiled language operates.

Algorithm is just a fancy way of saying \"a method to solve a problem\".  I'd recommend starting with sorting algorithms.

I recommend starting with simple file management scripts in python (rename all files in a folder, combine a bunch of text files into a single file, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work your way up to a more complex program, and frequently consult google (particularly stack overflow) when stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For theory, I&amp;#39;d recommend spending at least 20-40 hours playing around at practice first.  Make a few functioning scripts and be sure you understand basically what they do.  Once you&amp;#39;re at that phase, there&amp;#39;s two basic categories that you should research:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The entire stack of how a compiled language operates.  For the list below, understand what every item is for, how it works, and how it is abstracted into the next level:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;transistor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;logic gate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;binary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;assembly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;c&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher level language of choice (c++, python, php, javascript, java, whatever)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I list c because it is a very straighforward growth from assembly.  most other languages include abstractions that make coding easier but understanding harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)  Next category is Algorithms.  Algorithm is just a fancy way of saying &amp;quot;a method to solve a problem&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;d recommend starting with sorting algorithms. &lt;a href=\"http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a good site with animations for several common sorting algorithms.  it also has basic code for how to implement those algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Important things to understand with algorithms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;big O notation (i.e. how expensive an algorithm is as data set grows)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data structures (linked list vs array vs hash table )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;p vs np&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find websites or books that go over all of those, and I should mention that I didn&amp;#39;t have a really solid understanding of all of those concepts until 3 semesters into university.  If your students can even partially grasp half of these concepts they&amp;#39;ll be in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first comp sci course focused mainly on data structures and algorithms, with us programming in Java.  Even at the end of the semester, we didn&amp;#39;t really understand how the magic box of the compiler took our text and made functional programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c7wgjfn", "flair_text": null, "created": 1358133421.0, "created_utc": 1358129821.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_16i33e", "children": [], "author": "jadae", "id": "c7w99vv", "parent_id": "t3_16i33e", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "The AP Computer Science course focuses on object oriented programming and basic algorithm design as well as problem solving with Java.
