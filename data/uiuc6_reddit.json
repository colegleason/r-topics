I used to work for the University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) &lt;a href=\"http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/\"&gt;http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/&lt;/a&gt;, as a student caller who phoned alumni to receive donations for our university. The donations that UIF collects from Alumni is very essentially to funding all three U of I campuses, individual colleges, academics units, libraries, scholarships etc. UIF uses a standard computer phone banking software that dials an Alumnus, shows the student caller the Alum\u2019s current job, address, graduation year and major, previous donations, etc. and then prompts a script for the student caller to say to the Alum. If an alum does not answer or if an alum does not want to donate the student caller has to code the call and a reason for why a donation was not given to U of I.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the point in which Campus Spirit Revival becomes relevant. One of the most common responses, to not giving donations to the University was because of the loss of the Chief. The response is so common that it is the first reason coded in the program when a caller codes why an alumni did not donate. UIF trains all of the student callers multiples times with mock calls as to how to deal with Alumni who are upset with the loss of the Chief and has pre-scripted responses as to try to alleviate the situation, and possibly still get the Alumnus to donate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of calls in which Alumni told me that U of I lost them when they lost the Chief was discouraging. Granted a good number of Alumni calls were never answered, the ones that did answer either laughed, or regrettable told me \u201cno\u201d because of the Chief being gone and how the University does not care about the opinion of its Alumni. If an Alumnus was ever very upset about the Chief there was even a special comment coding that would go straight to the Chancellor\u2019s Office for them to assess input from the Alumni. All student workers at UIF know this is an issue, as otherwise we would not be trained so heavily on it. While some veteran student callers may disagree slightly it is only because they are set in their ways and with their seniority only have to call Alumni who are yearly renewal, frequent donors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data of how many donations are lost to U of I due to the loss of the Chief and their relationship with Alumni in theory should be quantifiable by the UIF coding system, but a dollar amount cannot be expressed as UIF managers claim \u201cwe cannot put a value on the loss of each donation from an Alumnus not donating because of the loss of the Chief \u2013 because there is no donation\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After working evening after evening calling Alumni and hearing them upset with the loss of Chief and how the University does not care of their input as an Alum, but only desiring their money, I eventually became sickened with my pre-scripted responses for the Alumni. Talking with the Alumni, brought light to how out of touch our University Administration was with Alumni, and I began to become sickened that I had become a part of that system. I decided I could no longer do the job UIF required of me. I no longer believed in the bullshit they told us to tell Alumni, the scripts of why to still donate with the Chief gone, if an Alum was upset with U of I, etc, so I quit my job at UIF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring all of this up now, because the reality is, that every year this university loses a larger amount of donations from Alumni not only because of the loss of the Chief, but because Alumni feel disillusioned by how little the University cares about their opinion on matters, such as the Chief. The review of comments on the Campus Spirit Revival Facebook page is flooded with negative remarks from Alumni and terrible rebuttals from the admins of the Campus Spirit Revival page. If the University follows through with the input from Campus Spirit Revival - this poor representation, unworthy to be associated with U of I - will be a large insult to Alumni and will be viewed as U of I once again turning its back on Alumni opinion. I have recently been told that Chancellor Wise has appointed a Dean to oversee the outcome of Campus Spirit Revival and use their input. If this input is reviewed in the similar fashion of the smoking referendum results, then Campus Spirit Revival\u2019s chosen mascot could be viewed by Chancellor Wise as input enough to put a motion forward.

The donations that UIF collects from Alumni is very essentially to funding all three U of I campuses, individual colleges, academics units, libraries, scholarships etc. UIF uses a standard computer phone banking software that dials an Alumnus, shows the student caller the Alum\u2019s current job, address, graduation year and major, previous donations, etc. and then prompts a script for the student caller to say to the Alum. If an alum does not answer or if an alum does not want to donate the student caller has to code the call and a reason for why a donation was not given to U of I.\n\nThis is the point in which Campus Spirit Revival becomes relevant. One of the most common responses, to not giving donations to the University was because of the loss of the Chief. The response is so common that it is the first reason coded in the program when a caller codes why an alumni did not donate. UIF trains all of the student callers multiples times with mock calls as to how to deal with Alumni who are upset with the loss of the Chief and has pre-scripted responses as to try to alleviate the situation, and possibly still get the Alumnus to donate.\n\nThe number of calls in which Alumni told me that U of I lost them when they lost the Chief was discouraging. Granted a good number of Alumni calls were never answered, the ones that did answer either laughed, or regrettable told me \u201cno\u201d because of the Chief being gone and how the University does not care about the opinion of its Alumni. If an Alumnus was ever very upset about the Chief there was even a special comment coding that would go straight to the Chancellor\u2019s Office for them to assess input from the Alumni. All student workers at UIF know this is an issue, as otherwise we would not be trained so heavily on it. While some veteran student callers may disagree slightly it is only because they are set in their ways and with their seniority only have to call Alumni who are yearly renewal, frequent donors. \n\nThe data of how many donations are lost to U of I due to the loss of the Chief and their relationship with Alumni in theory should be quantifiable by the UIF coding system, but a dollar amount cannot be expressed as UIF managers claim \u201cwe cannot put a value on the loss of each donation from an Alumnus not donating because of the loss of the Chief \u2013 because there is no donation\u201d.\n\nAfter working evening after evening calling Alumni and hearing them upset with the loss of Chief and how the University does not care of their input as an Alum, but only desiring their money, I eventually became sickened with my pre-scripted responses for the Alumni. Talking with the Alumni, brought light to how out of touch our University Administration was with Alumni, and I began to become sickened that I had become a part of that system. I decided I could no longer do the job UIF required of me. I no longer believed in the bullshit they told us to tell Alumni, the scripts of why to still donate with the Chief gone, if an Alum was upset with U of I, etc, so I quit my job at UIF.\n\nI bring all of this up now, because the reality is, that every year this university loses a larger amount of donations from Alumni not only because of the loss of the Chief, but because Alumni feel disillusioned by how little the University cares about their opinion on matters, such as the Chief. The review of comments on the Campus Spirit Revival Facebook page is flooded with negative remarks from Alumni and terrible rebuttals from the admins of the Campus Spirit Revival page. If the University follows through with the input from Campus Spirit Revival - this poor representation, unworthy to be associated with U of I - will be a large insult to Alumni and will be viewed as U of I once again turning its back on Alumni opinion. I have recently been told that Chancellor Wise has appointed a Dean to oversee the outcome of Campus Spirit Revival and use their input. If this input is reviewed in the similar fashion of the smoking referendum results, then Campus Spirit Revival\u2019s chosen mascot could be viewed by Chancellor Wise as input enough to put a motion forward. Should Campus Spirit Revival be backed by U of I or their results taken seriously by University Administration, I feel this could turn Alumni away from U of I on the same magnitude as if they removed the Chief a second time.\n\nPlease consider our U of I Alumni and how their donations fund this great university when making an opinion on Campus Spirit Revival. \nSupport Stop Campus Spirit Revival http://www.facebook.com/StopCampusSpiritRevival?fref=ts\n\nAnd when voting in Campus Spirit Revival\u2019s farce of a contest, vote \u201cNo New Symbol\u201d, as Good Alumni Relations and campus funding may just hang in the balance.\n", "saved": false, "id": "171694", "clicked": false, "title": "Ex-U of I Foundation Student Caller's Thoughts on Campus Spirit Revival", "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_171694", "children": [], "author": "No_Mojo", "id": "c81taua", "parent_id": "t3_171694", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "That's really sad to hear that this leaves such a wound with all the alums.
