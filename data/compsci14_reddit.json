I have a degree in Computer Science and I'm in my second year of graduate school for offensive and defensive security.  I am looking for something to really get into and get a deep understanding of. Because programs need space to execute (duh) I figured memory (heaps, stacks, etc.) would be a good place to invest some time.\n\nI know the basics and have good programming skills, so what I'm really looking for are articles, tutorials, books, etc. on pretty much anything memory related: buffer overflows, how applications are assigned memory, how the OS manages memory, what a stack is, what a heap is, how to access your allotted heap or stack space manually, how it is possible for memory to be accessed by crackers, paging, cache, to just name a few. As I said already I have a CS degree so some of these listed items would be review, but it never hurts to brush up on them.\n\nI'm really just getting into my field so any resources, even if novice level, would be appreciated to get me up and going!

For example, using scer&amp;#39;s example, you could choose &lt;code&gt;x =&amp;gt; aaaabb&lt;/code&gt; which would compress it even smaller. When you have a lot of data, it becomes much harder to find the best possible way to encode something, so most programs just try to find a reasonable answer, and different programs may find different answers for the same input. (There are some compression formats which do give the same answer every time though)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;can compression show history when cross referenced with the original file?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly what you mean here? I think you&amp;#39;re asking &amp;quot;Can you work if a file has been compressed by comparing it to the original&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In which case, it depends what compression format you&amp;#39;re using. Some formats like ZIP, PNG or FLAC provide lossless compression which means they preserve the information perfectly, and will be identical when decompressed. However these formats can often still be quite large, so in order to compress even smaller, some formats like JPEG, MP3 or H264 throw away some information. So when you compare it with the original file there will be small differences.
