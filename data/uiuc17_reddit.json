However, it is important to note that this represents a *specific instance* in which the administration violated the contract language *from 2009*. We are not considering going on strike because of what happened from the 2009 contract, but what we are pushing for in the 2012 contract, which is a separate issue entirely. The 2012 contract language is not something we can take to court; this is something we are supposed to negotiate in the bargaining room, and we are legally negotiating it. However, we are meeting a lot of hostility and stonewalling from the administration, regardless of how open it has claimed to be in its communication to students. The GEO firmly believes a strike can be avoided, and we have already made significant concessions to try to seek compromise.

Could someone provide me some numbers or something to show that grad students should be getting both types of financial assistance?\n\n&gt;I am certainly not against grad students receiving both tuition waivers and a stipend, I'm just wondering what the actual reasons are. The only reason I really ask is that a friend of mine who is also an alumni brought up this point. He and I are both in law school and are currently taking out loans to pay for it. Is that not an option for grad students? If this sounds combative, I promise I'm not trying to be. I'm just looking for some reasons behind the amount of financial assistance that grad students have available to them.\n\nThis is a very good question, and I am glad that someone asked it! The GEO\u2019s position is that as graduate employees, we teach a solid fifth of all course instruction on this campus. However, the University saves a *lot* of money by paying us very low wages (we don\u2019t receive stipends, we earn wages) instead of paying faculty to teach those classes. If the University had *no* graduate assistants to teach its courses, then it would have to hire professors to do all of that work for triple and quadruple the amount we are paid. We are *kind of* okay with the low wages (we would still like to earn the cost of living for this area and stop being able to apply for WIC and government aid) because we realize that we get substantial tuition waivers. Something to keep in mind is that we never see a dime of those tuition waivers, so even though we receive them, we don\u2019t actually \u201ccash in\u201d on them. However, we consider both waivers and wages as part of the compensation for the work we put into the University. \n\nUnlike other graduate students who receive no waivers (for example, students in the College of Law or College of Medicine), our labor props up this university. If you are interested in the specific numbers, [this website from the University shows that grad employees teach 20% of all classes and 36% of all 100-level courses]( http://www.dmi.illinois.edu/cp/). Without being able to offer competitive wages and waivers, the University will not be able to attract star graduate students. It is common sense that qualified graduate students will be courted from a variety of grad programs, and they will go where the money is, so to speak. It is the GEO\u2019s position that better qualified graduate employees results in better educated undergraduates. Therefore, continuing to offer compensation (in the form of livable wages and tuition waivers) is how you attract highly qualified graduate employees.

I will also add that for many people $900 is not a sufficient amount of money to live on monthly. If you consider monthly rent or mortgage payment, our health insurance premiums (not to be confused with the McKinley Student Health fee), and food for a whole month, $900 runs pretty thin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to the money that is taken out of paychecks due to GEO membership dues, that money is negligible. For grad employees who are in the bargaining unit (teaching assistants and graduate assistants), dues are a mere 2% of their paycheck with a cap of $45. Grad employees who are not in the bargaining unit (research assistants and pre-professional graduate assistants) pay $3 per paycheck into dues. Non-employed members of the union pay no dues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am unclear what you are asking about with regards to \u201cwhat happens with that?\u201d If you\u2019d like to rephrase your question, I\u2019ll make another attempt at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": "geo", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c76iu8f", "flair_text": "Graduate, CMN", "created": 1353868556.0, "created_utc": 1353864956.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_13rgg6", "children": [], "author": "ReadShift", "id": "c76k2vb", "parent_id": "t3_13rgg6", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "What can we do to help you guys?", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we do to help you guys?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c76k2vb", "flair_text": null, "created": 1353873317.0, "created_utc": 1353869717.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_13rgg6", "children": [], "author": "thtrtechie", "id": "c774ccm", "parent_id": "t3_13rgg6", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "If we, as undergrads, have day-to-day research obligations (that include assurance of animal welfare), how can we cross picket lines without looking like we oppose this movement?
