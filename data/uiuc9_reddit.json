I'd like to think myself rather experienced with career fairs so I'd love to give some advice.\n\nwtfsachode has a pretty good list of advice as to what you should be doing to **prepare:**\n\n1) Go to the 3rd floor of DCL and print out a name tag at the Engineering Career Services Center.  (All the way up the main stairs, first double doors on your right.  There should be a lady with a British accent who you can ask for where to print.)\n\n2) While you're there, I'm pretty sure they also let you print out your resume on cotton paper (I may be wrong).\n\n3) Know every single company you are going to talk to before you even enter the career fair.  My research for the Fall Expo and Fair took about 4-5 hours each (I went to about 13 companies per event).  Know what they do, where they are located, what they do for the community/humanitarian causes, and try to find out what positions they have for you.\n\n4) Something to add to wtfsachode's 5th point: Talk about what you have done in school/projects/side projects that made you interested in the company you are currently talking to.  I usually talk about labs, because they like to see hands on experience.\n\n5) Try to get a professional portfolio to bring, and also, bring a pen.\n\nAs for the **actual day of the fair itself**, here's a couple of things I would advise:\n\n1) Suit up.\n\n2) Give yourself enough time to talk to companies, as well as to take breaks to compose yourself.  13 companies took me 2.5 hours to talk to (some people go much faster).\n\n3) Remember, *these recruiters are people*.  Younger students tend to think recruiters are some incredible beings who control your entire future success, but *they are people*.  Talk to them as if they were a friend you respected.\n\n4) You don't have to do this, but after I talk with each company, I write down the company name, who I talked to, and how to apply for the position I just talked to them about.  Make a nice checklist for you to be able to run down once you get home to apply.\n\n\nAnd lastly, as for the content of the talks to the recruiters, I usually don't memorize responses.  Before these events, I spend some time thinking about my past experiences that I could relate to during the talk.  I usually go with an elevator pitch, ending with \"... and I saw you had this position available online, and was wondering what steps I need to take to continue the application process.\"  After this, I wing it with my experiences, why I like their company, etc.\n\n\n\nSorry for the huge wall of text.  Career fairs get much easier the more you talk go to them and talk with recruiters, so it's good that you're starting as a sophomore.
