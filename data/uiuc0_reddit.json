Safety first and don't be a dumbass, I don't want to see any of you awesome dudes in hospital or handcuffs.\n\n2. If you are under 21, stay away from Green street, its crawling with cops and you can't get into bars now.\n\n3. If you can, buy alcohol off campus. Its significantly cheaper. If you're &lt; 21 and looking for someone to buy for you, ask someone to buy today or early tomorrow, nobody is going to want to buy stuff for other people on Friday.\n\n4. Walk in groups. Crime happens, and there's no easier target than a lone drunkard. Know the numbers of the campus PD and saferides/walks \n\n5. [this](http://i.imgur.com/rdIBH.jpg) gives some great help for dealing with cops and general safety (thanks /u/Helpful_guy).\n\n***\n\n&gt; Being drunk doesn't mean your behavior gets excused by everyone.\n\n\n&gt; Pace yourself. Eat lots. Don't forget about drinking water every once in a while to stay hydrated.\n\n\n&gt; Dont do simple dumb things, remember the age old rule \"Do one illegal thing at a time\" aka dont j-walk, climb shit, litter, etc.\n\n\n&gt; Another big thing is if you have a party to make sure no randoms are coming in. I was at a house party that was busted at Polar Bear (SIUC) this winter and the undercover cop was a woman posing as a sorostitute (minding she was a solid 8.5) so don't assume that kind of trickery does not happen here.\n\n\n&gt; I don't have any tips but the people who really lick their chops over unofficial are the tow truck drivers.
