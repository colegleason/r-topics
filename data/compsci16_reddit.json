I'm a Junior at a University very well known for its CS program, and each day as summer draws closer and I still have yet to hear back from any prospective internship employers (wasn't excellent at applying, did poorly in some interviews due to nerves).  I have a 3.4 technical GPA (freshman year was bad for me, but this isn't absolutely awful considering the school average) and I'm wondering how difficult it is to find work after graduating given that you have no work experience whatsoever.  \n\nEven if I do secure an internship this late (school ends in a month) I would be sacrificing a family vacation to various parts of Asia like Taiwan/Japan, which is an experience that I would love to have.\n\nEssentially I'm asking for stories and advice: Assuming I do get an offer, would you say the internship experience is more valuable than a trip with my family to the other side of the world? Assuming I don't get an internship, would you recommend summer courses to remove a humanities requirement so I can focus more on my academia, trying to get Research with a professor (unlikely grad school, but always a possibility), or trying to find some sort of open source project which I hear is also good to do (though I wouldn't even have any idea where to begin or what to do)?\n\nMuch Love \u2665\n", "saved": false, "id": "sdygo", "clicked": false, "title": "[Q] Did any of you graduate without any internship or work experience?

So far, it seems MS is the better choice.  I just received a response to an email I sent regarding the courses necessary to enter UIUC.  The person pretty much shot me down stating only 10% of all applicants to the MS program get in, and there were 1650 applicants which all either came from a CS background or have a strong understanding and experience in CS.  She opened up the response with &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s hard to advise you a successful path getting into our MS program if you do not have a CS background&amp;quot;. Ouch.

This can be further generalized into other problems: given x, y, and z containers, is it possible to distribute z liters of water into z/2 liters in the other containers (given z/2 &amp;lt; x or y)? If so, what is the minimum number of moves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come up with some currencies for fake countries (or look up real currencies!). Design an algorithm that answers this question: starting at a given currency, it is possible to convert your money to various other currencies in such a way that you end up at the original currency with more money than you started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a question that will really challenge you and help you learn more about CS and computability: Given a boolean formula with n variables and m clauses (variables can be assigned values of true and false) of the form (x1 v x2 v !x3) ^ (!x1 v x2) ... etc. There are at most 3 &amp;quot;literals&amp;quot; that are OR&amp;#39;d together in one &amp;quot;clause&amp;quot; (i.e. you can only have at most 3 variables in each clause), and each clause is and&amp;#39;d together in order to form the entire formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you write an algorithm that finds values for x1, x2, ... , xn such that the formula is true quickly? The answer is no, not simply. This question (3SAT) is NP-complete. An interesting question though, is this: can you write an algorithm that can do this in non-polynomial time? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4a89j8", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333997170.0, "created_utc": 1333993570.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_s100g", "children": [], "author": "vcarl", "id": "c4a8yjz", "parent_id": "t3_s100g", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "I've wanted to give [this](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) a shot for a while, seems like exactly what you're looking for.

Since at least one of these characters is not the midpoint (if it exists), a change in these characters can produce another string s2 that is not a palindrome. But since the algorithm never read these characters, it cannot distinguish between the two strings, and therefore must give the same answer for both inputs s1 and s2, so it is wrong for at least one input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: It looks like I skimmed too casually and missed their definition of &amp;quot;real-time&amp;quot; before getting into the thick of it.
