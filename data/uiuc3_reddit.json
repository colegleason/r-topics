Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985.\nThere will be two special midnight showings on Friday and Saturday, a matinee on Sunday, and 10PM shows Wednesday and Thursday (a great date movie for Valentine's Day). The theater will also be decked out in an \"Enchantment Under The Sea\" theme! If there is interest in a meetup around one of the screenings, feel free to use the comments to set it up!
