Competitively, and soon.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/148x8w/i_need_to_play_pool_competitively_and_soon/</url><snippet>Hey, where can I get a decent game around here? Anything goes, just no shitty tables and no french pool.  [Jupiter's Pizza in downtown has leagues.](http://www.jupiterspizza.com) Sorry, I'm not looking for that sort of league. I don't want to beat people, I want to beat the best people around- the idea of a reward is less appealing to me than the idea that I beat the best around...BUT, you get an upvote anyway, because I could totally get down on this league on a drinking night. Thank you.  Well I mean that depends on your skill level. Everyone thinks they're good at pool. You could always come play with the Illinois team and me sometime and see.  Clarification by OP; I am over 21 and looking for a legit league that could improve not only my ability to apply 'english' on heavy/cross table shots, but also improve my ability to pull off double shots (aka french-style pool), and sharp rebound shots within my game. You sound like the man that could help me. Include details or a link for a tryout if you have it. Thank you. You won't necessarily get better with league play. You'll just pay lots of money to play short little races. I mean, again, that depends on your skill level. Next semester lots of things will be coming up, like Regionals (here at UIUC) and Illinois state tournament.   </snippet></document><document><title>Advice on choosing a minor</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/147w26/advice_on_choosing_a_minor/</url><snippet>ABE student here, focusing on Biological engineering. I'm trying to decide between a minor in bioengineering, biomolecular engineering, and chemistry. I'm leaning toward the first two. I'd like to hear some people's advice ( pros and cons ) towards any or all of the above minors. I'm hoping to go to grad school after undergrad. Goals: High income, flexible career opportunities, job security, flexible working hours, ability to obtain superior knowledge, ability to greatly benefit society.  Consider not doing a minor, and instead doing something that someone would want to talk to you about in an interview.

If the classes in the minor are something you are taking anyway, or if they will be cool / relevant enough that your ideal employer might care about what you did there, then it's a good idea. Otherwise, it's a line on your resume that will probably be skipped over since it sounds so similar to your major anyway.

I'm not a biological engineer, but this is a perspective to weigh against the alternatives. Good luck! I'm already planning on doing some research or an internship.. or possibly both. Out of those two options what do you recommend? also where do recommend I start to look for these opportunities? I'm already planning on doing some research or an internship.. or possibly both.

Especially stories about battery life.  Don't believe me?  Go back five years in a science news archive and look at all their five year predictions. I know it's popular on reddit to be totally cynical about any scientific findings, but the whole point of the article is to explain that they're putting a lot of funding towards a lofty goal.  Whether or not that specific number is achieved in 5 years isn't as important as the level of funding they're giving to the problem.  You put a lot of great scientists and engineers on a problem and they make progress on it. Nobody is going to put hundreds of millions of dollars down on a timid goal.

I could agree with your statement if you said it was about fusion research or something else similar that's far off, but battery research has been making steady progress for years now.  It's so important because renewable energy sources such as wind and solar need grid-level storage in order to be useful on a large scale.

But 5x is a tremendous leap forward.  Promising such a specific positive outcome for a large collaborative research beyond a five year horizon is unrealistic.  This is PR hype to justify funding.  This happens all the time.  Look at the human genome project.  We were promised the cure for cancer and all kinds of revolutionary outcomes from the consortium.  The basic science has been a tremendous boon, but the specific outcomes were't what the hype machine promised.</snippet></document><document><title>Does anyone know what causes the power plant to generate such noise every now and then?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/144bv2/does_anyone_know_what_causes_the_power_plant_to/</url><snippet>It's a sound that reverberates across the entire southwest side of campus, it seems.

Are there many research opportunities? I know there's a hospital near campus, so doing volunteer work there during the semester shouldn't be a problem. Is there a pre-med advising program? On college confidential, I saw a statistic that said approx. 45% of pre-meds who apply get accepted into med school. I couldn't find a source for that stat, and I honestly thought it was a bit higher, so can someone verify the accuracy of that stat? Thanks.  I found [this](http://blog.admissions.illinois.edu/?p=776).

I don't know where you saw the 45% since UIUC does not even have a pre-med major.. and I am not sure how they would get statistics on it. A LOT of students in MCB/bio/chem all claim they are pre-med their freshmen year.. I highly doubt half of them end up going to med school.  I'm materials science pre-med. I'm interested in the academia side of medicine. I've been to the pre-med advising once and it's pretty good. They will tell you what you need to know. I don't know about that statistic or even if the university has a statistic on the fact. 

PM me if you have any specific questions, I've done a lot of research on this stuff. Thanks. I guess I'm just worried about not having enough research opportunities to research what I'm interested in. Since you're interested in the academic side of medicine, I don't know what year you are, but you've probably done some summer research or something of that sort at least. If there are enough research opportunities, which they're probably are at a school like UIUC, how would I go about getting them? Finding research is really the least your your worries. For me, it was as simple as emailing a few and providing them with my CV that included my grades and resume (I did this directly after freshmen year). From there, three or four professors emailed me back and asked if I could meet them in their lab and discuss my research goals and if I would be a good fit.

After that I chose a lab and have been working in this lab since the end of summer and plan to continuing doing research in it throughout the rest of my undergrad so I can do a senior thesis. I'm materials science pre-med. I'm interested in the academia side of medicine. I've been to the pre-med advising once and it's pretty good. They will tell you what you need to know. I don't know about that statistic or even if the university has a statistic on the fact.

Is there a garage nearby that would do a 20 pt. inspection? I just want to check whether everything is ok before I go ahead with it....  I usually go to Myler Automotive. They're good people. I've had some bad experience with Myler.  They let fairly generous timelines slip without saying a word to me and kept promising to finish the job "tomorrow" whenever I called.  They said the job would take a few days.  It ended up taking just over a week.

And... I hate to say this, but they're not exactly cheap, either.  I wanted to give them a second chance after the above experience, because they seem like nice people.  But their quote was more expensive than the dealership charged me.  The dealership had the job done the next day.  Myler said they couldn't even start working on my car for a week.

They're extremely friendly, but I think they've just got more work than they can handle.  Rather than turning people away, they're not being honest with themselves or their customers.    You could do a 20-pt inspection yourself.  If you're going to pay a mechanic to do it, have them do an exhaustively thorough inspection. Well, I don't really know much about cars, how could I do that? There are websites that will give you a checklist to go through - make sure that this component doesn't move when you try to wiggle it, etc.  But for a really thorough inspection you have to disassemble certain parts and for that you need a mechanic.  So if you're going to have a mechanic look at a used car anyway, pay a little extra and have him do a thorough inspection rather than just a basic one.  </snippet></document><document><title>Where can I get free or very cheap food on campus during the month of December.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/142bbp/where_can_i_get_free_or_very_cheap_food_on_campus/</url><snippet>Here's the deal:

The IRS started garnishing my wages this month without giving me prior notification. Looking into the matter further, I'm pretty sure I don't even owe the money that they're pulling from my paychecks. Regardless, I'm now broke. Not just student-broke. I'm $1.24-in-my-account-broke. And it looks like I'm going to be barely skating by for the entire month of December. If anyone knows where or how to get free, or very cheap food on campus or in the CU area, please speak up!  Up until the end of the semester, you can get free lunches at the cultural houses on Nevada. Not too much but at least its one meal.

Also, I don't know if there is one in Champaign (you'd have to look a little) but most Sikh Gurudwaras will serve you a free meal (and when I say free meal, I mean a free, real meal). &amp;gt;  you can get free lunches at the cultural houses on Nevada.

http://studentaffairs.illinois.edu/diversity/lunch.html Do you think it'd be an imposition to show up to those meals? I know beggars can't be choosers, but I'm wondering whether I might be overstepping my bounds by eating the meals, but having no involvement within the community.  ~~What do you do for ISR? And~~ tell me more about the garnishing.

There should be [clear limits](http://www.dol.gov/compliance/guide/garnish.htm#BasicPro) to the amount that your wages can be garnished.

Also, [/r/RandomActsOfPizza](http://randomactsofpizza.com/).

 &amp;gt; What do you do for ISR? 

He said IRS. Though my impression was that courts garnish wages, not IRS. Woops, I misread that.

Is is a Tax Levy or actual Wage Garnishment? :/

In Illinois, the IRS can only request a Levy of up to 15% of your gross income for back taxes due... and you should have 10 days notice. [see here](http://tax.illinois.gov/Individuals/collection.htm)

Are you a student? You should be visiting student legal services.  [Here](http://eifoodbank.org/find-help/where-to-find-food/) is a list of places. Thanks! This is awesome. Thanks! This is awesome.  While they're still open for the semester, you can volunteer at the Red Herring for an hour for a free meal.  While school is still in session, look up meetings of campus RSOs. They will often have pizza, and there's a million of them. Good call, thanks.  You may want to look into different soup kitchens and food pantries around Champaign. For example, [the Wesley Food Pantry at Green and Goodwin](http://wesleypantry.org/getting-help/) has a distribution date on December 20th. There's also [Salt and Light](http://www.saltandlightministry.org/) across town on Anthony Drive.

(fake email?)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14163k/ece329_exam_not_cancelled_fake_email/</url><snippet>http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/5363/329examcancellation.png

So I got that email, and several before it about the solution set for the exam being for sale.

But apparently the exam did happen!?  Ah... so... are there any ECE classes that have *not* been hacked as of late? Another "Ass Mail" was sent out this Tuesday for ece 190. pics plz Ah... so... are there any ECE classes that have *not* been hacked as of late?    My boyfriend is in that class. Here's what he said:

-gets email about answers for sale. He forwards it to the professor. 


-gets another email about the exam being cancelled. Hooray! At this point our Internet goes down in the dorm I'm at. 


-a mutual friend who lives in the dorm and is in the same class didn't get the cancelation email. As he also doesn't have a smart phone, he goes to the test. 


-so little people went, that the teachers cancel the test, saying that they will make some sort of other assignment to do.


-friend comes back 15 min after test is supposed to start,  boyfriend has a minor heart attack. Newman?     I'm in the class and went to the exam, you're fine. It was not meant to be cancelled, the Professor's email was hacked, but because of the confusion and since people didn't show up, they actually cancelled the exam.

They will send in email soon about what they will do to make up for the exam. I find it hilarious that, of all people, an ECE professor's email was hacked. I find it hilarious that, of all people, an ECE professor's email was hacked. Being in ECE doesn't  mean you know anything about networking, security, mitm attacks, phishing, etc. I'd wager that I know more about security than a lot of ECE people. 

And shit, for all we know, the professor could have made the dumb physical mistake of leaving a computer logged in unattended and someone decided to trollol the class, which isn't hacking, just being a dick.  Dude, you should do CS460/461/463 as an elective!

We are both done with finals on the 17th, but we're thinking of staying until the 22nd and really enjoy all that Champaign-Urbana has to offer without the stress of classes. 

Redditors, what would you do or recommend we do before we head back home? Any ideas appreciated; I'm sure there will be other people with nothing to do that wouldn't mind a few suggestions.

Suggestions can include anything; restaurants, activities, or places to see. 

Here is the current list:
-Allerton (Provided there is snow)
-Flat Top brunch
-Japan House
-Altgeld Bell Tower
-Ice Skating
-Racquetball at the ARC
-Swimming/Hot Tub at CRCE
-Piano Man
-Black Dog

Fan of the list so far.

-Blind Pig (always a good idea, you can go on mug night and get a mug plus cheap beer whenever you go back on a tuesday or thursday).
-Arboretum trail  (if you're going to Japan house you will pass it, so you could just stop by).
-Hockey game (if they're still going on)
  Get info from the UIAS on how to get to the off-campus dark site (15 minutes away), and spend a couple hours under the stars :D I checked the website http://uias.astro.illinois.edu/ and couldn't find anything about it. Any suggestions?           Try Emerald City for brunch instead of Flat Top.  Monday: Joes
Tuesday: Joes
Wednesday: White Ho for some karaoke 
Thursday: Brothers for $1 drinks
Friday: anywhere but lion
Saturday: Anywhere but lion
Sunday: Firehause  Or if you're not in a Greek organization. 

Downtown champaign:
Blind pig brewery
Memphis on main- leaky tap runs every night which is a mason jar of beer for three dollars. Different random beer every night. One time it was honey brown, one time shock top, another Ham's. just depends on what they have extra of. 

White horse's kareokee night is pretty solid. 
Try Murphy's for logo or international night. 
Obligatory apple pie shot at Illi inn

And second, is there a minimum dress code, or will I be able to wear khakis and a sweater?

Thank you for your time  there is no dress code but you will look like a wang if you show up in ripped jeans and a ride the lightning tshirt. Khakis and a sweater will make you fit right in there is no dress code but you will look like a wang if you show up in ripped jeans and a ride the lightning tshirt. Khakis and a sweater will make you fit right in   No no no. Come as you are. I mean you ARE attending The Nutcracker. Absolutely no one cares. Just don't show up stinking of booze, you might not know it, but the person next to you can smell it and it's not that pleasant (even though those blue hairs are pulling down serious amounts of wine before the show). Cheers!
  Khakis and a sweater should be okay I think; the average person dresses at least business casual (or is it called "evening casual" in this situation?). Just no jeans/shorts (at least not to operas/ballets/concerts - these might be okay for plays in the Studio Theatre). Women usually wear dresses. Okay, thank you!

I am assuming "cooking meth" involves actual cooking on a stove? If it wasn't something illegal I would think they would call 911 before trying to use a couch to put out the fire.

And why has the FBI been notified if it were a mere fire? What's even more interesting for me is that when I got out of the apartment and heard the kid screaming bloody murder for help inside the smoking apartment, the tenant of that apartment was outside freaking out. He left his *visiting* friend in the potentially unfamiliar apartment, and left him trapped to a point where he had to jump out a window... Da fuck man.  I was sitting next to his friend who jumped out the window on the bus for some time, and throughout the conversations he was mumbling "fucking piece of shit, fucking asshole, etc." repeatedly....

I'm one of the currently displaced people who live in this building. The apartment itself is not too badly destroyed, as the fire was contained to one single apartment on the 2nd floor of a 3 story building. There will undoubtedly be some smoke damage to other units, but it was contained fairly quickly.

In regards to why there is a huge investigation, we were told this morning that the tenant admitted to making a "smoke bomb" on the stove but then refused to give consent to enter the apartment to the police. Based on this information the police took him into custody, taped the building off, and told us we wouldn't be getting in until some time early this afternoon (at the earliest). 

Evan, the man who jumped down to us, was on the bus with us for most of the wait and appeared to be fully cooperating with police. That is to say, he wasn't taken into custody. He is also honestly lucky to be alive as he (according to his story) struggled to find the apartments window and inhaled a ton of smoke.

These Illini Alerts are seriously unnecessary. 99% of people who get these alerts are sleeping at that time. People who are near the area will see the fire/smoke and stay away, and the police can cordon off the area and keep people away. There is no need to wake so many people up in the middle of the night. Then don't sign up for the text alerts? It's optional, so why are you complaining? On the one hand I agree, but on the other hand it would be nice to subscribe to "only alerts that I could possibly care about / react to." A reasonable argument to make is that Illini-Alert should only contain such alerts anyway! On the one hand I agree, but on the other hand it would be nice to subscribe to "only alerts that I could possibly care about / react to." A reasonable argument to make is that Illini-Alert should only contain such alerts anyway! I think time of the day, whether the danger is localized, etc. should be taken into account. If there is an active shooter at large or hazardous chemicals have been released from a chemistry lab, it makes sense to inform everyone because the danger isn't contained in a limited area. If it is a fire that isn't spreading, only the building's residents and possibly the ones nearby need to know, especially at that time of the night, and the sirens from fire engines and police cars will wake them up. There was a fire at Za's in the morning last year and it made sense to send out that Illini Alert, since it saved people the inconvenience of going to Green Street and having to come back because it was closed - again, it was not dangerous (to people away from the area who received the alerts), but saved them some inconvenience.

That said, what is going on at First and John? Half the Illini Alerts are about incidents in that area - this one, and [this](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/courts-police-and-fire/2012-11-04/roommates-arrested-fight-brings-building-evacuation.html) and [this](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/courts-police-and-fire/2012-05-28/all-clear-given-campustown.html).

Really getting a text message work you up and ruined a good nights sleep? Also they can't tell who lives where/walking around/visiting. What if I got my headphones on and not near a window?
 It is hardly likely that the building residents evacuated the building due to an Illini Alert. The police would have woken them up and evacuated them. If you had headphones on you wouldn't be able to hear the incoming text message either. It's not so much about ruining a good night's sleep but the fact that I get scared when I get a text message at such an unusual time, and panic wondering who is texting me, what happened, etc. Take the 10 seconds to read the text and you will know who is texting you AND what the text message says. Then you don't need to get scared and panic. It is hardly likely that the building residents evacuated the building due to an Illini Alert. The police would have woken them up and evacuated them.

Is there more bio or more programming (presumably programming because its cs, but you never know)?
I'm not a cs student but I do work in bioinformatics independently and am very interested in taking this course  I assume Dr. Sinha is teaching it again (a good thing)...

It's actually not all that difficult, but gives an introduction to many of the common algorithms of bioinformatics. This will be lots of general topics often encountered elsewhere in CS, just applied specifically to bioinformatics. Things like pattern matching (via trees, hashing, ...), HMMs, string alignment (basic dynamic programming concepts, Smith-Waterman algorithm, ...), clustering and classification, ...you get the idea. It's definitely a breadth rather than depth sort of course, so if you're already familiar with such topics, the course may be of limited use; but if not, the course is a fair introduction.

However, realize it's purely a CS course. You may see one lecture that runs through the absolute basics of molecular biology, that's it. But don't think it's just for CS people, a few people from outside of CS were in the course when I took it.

As for structure, it's a few on-paper assignments, one programming assignment, and a midterm and final exam.   </snippet></document><document><title>Looking for a Christmas tree?!?

(or share your general UIUC experience)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/13xalw/looking_into_transferring_next_year_would_like/</url><snippet>I'm a freshman at a private liberal arts university and I am looking into transferring in the Fall 2013. I applied last year as a senior and got wait-listed, and was wondering if that has any effect on my transfer decision?

 I am currently undecided but will complete 34-36 credits by Fall 2013 and possibly looking into the biology program. How hard is it to get in the biology or chemistry program there?

Also wondering about housing and scholarships. I might consider joining a sorority, so what is the process like for sophomores? And what about the housing situation? 

Also, I know the transfer application deadline is pretty late in the year, and I am worried I will not get be able to apply/receive scholarships or receive sufficient financial aid, so does anyone have experience with this?

I know I am asking for a lot, but I appreciate any input on your experience at UIUC so far!    I was accepted as a freshman transfer last Spring. Here's my experience: 

That fact that you were wait-listed before will have no bearing on your decision this time around. However, as szaero pointed out, if you have less than 30 completed credits on your transcript when you apply, they will look at your high school transcript and ACT/SAT scores. 

I had a lot of health problems in high school, so I eventually dropped out. Then I got my GED and began taking classes online through Arizona State. After taking 12 credit hours (with 6 still in progress), I applied to UIUC in the Division of General Studies. Instead of directly applying to a program that interests you, I would highly recommend applying to DGS, as it is less selective and has very minimal requirements for transfers. Edit: It is very easy to transfer into the major of your choice after a semester or two at UIUC, so long as you meet the program's requirements and have decent grades.

I know nothing about Sororities, so I can't help you there. However, with housing, I would not recommend the dorms. Renting an apartment (even a really nice apartment, close to campus) is almost always cheaper than the dorms. I have heard going this route makes it harder to make friends, but if you're considering going Greek and/or have a decent personality, you should be fine. Yup, I agree with this -- try for DGS.  I transferred into sociology before psych.  My GPA and everything was fine, but I had to take my alternative major choice at first because I was lacking one required class (I transferred in as a JR) that my CC didn't offer.  So I might have not been accepted into the program if it weren't for that. (Switching majors within LAS once you're in is incredibly easy-- take the req's you need, do well, and switch.  Easy as that.  Getting in is the hard part.)

 This is true except in the case of technical majors, which have entry requirements even once you are inside LAS. I'm glad it worked out for you!! I worry a lot about transfer students.

 So is the DGS for undecided majors (and also easier to get in than picking a major)? and how do I know what required classes I need to take before transferring?  http://admissions.illinois.edu/apply/requirements_transfer_handbook.html

Requirements are in the transfer handbook, it varies by college and major. If you're at a college in Illinois right now you can use transfer.org to correlate all of your college's course numbers to UIUC course numbers.

I followed the transfer handbook and transfer.org. All of my course credits were accepted.

So I'm going to be subleasing an apt for next semester and have been working out the agreement with my subleasee for the place. My subleasee just asked me to pay him a deposit on the place which he says I'll get back at the end. Is this reasonable and a regular thing for subleasees to ask?

I know when you sign a contract for an apartment you need to pay a deposit, but is there any way for me as a subleaser to just have the deposit switched, instead of me having to pay the sublessee independently and just trusting that he will return the deposit once the term has ended??

What is the general procedure for this??

Thanks for your help!

EDIT: I should add that throughout this entire process, the sublesee has been very helpful and I trust him, but I just in case I don't want to lose a full months rent... I heard some housing companies are just dicks and won't return the deposit anyways, so I don't want to have to pay for the entire years worth of deposit if he wasn't going to be receiving it back anyways...   I agree that it's a good question to ask the Tenant's Union.  A deposit isn't totally out of the ordinary for a sublease, but make sure than the terms of the deposit are described in whatever contract or paperwork you plan to sign.  If I remember correctly, if you give anyone any sum of money, they are not bound to return it if they are not on contract.  I doubt your sublessor has ill intentions, but it's always better to be sure. Ahh I actualy just reread the sublease agreement that we signed and it actually is down on paper. I didn't know about how much the deposit would be, but on my agreement, its for the full deposit. I guess it's probably too late to ask that it only be for part of the deposit huh? :/   With JSM, part of the sublease agreement includes that the subleaser pay the the subleasee some percentage of the original deposit, to be returned upon end of agreement less any damages.

Get your agreement in ink, preferably in the contract, and have it witnessed, signed, and/or maintained by the landlord. Ahh yea, I realized that it actually is on the sublease agreement that I signed, though its for the full deposit and not a percent of the original (though that number had been agreed upon already... now I realize I probably shouldve asked to pay just a percent of the original deposit shouldnt I?)

I trust my subleaser, but I'm just worried since i've heard some companies never return the deposit anyways just because theyre dicks... did you ever have problems with JSM about that? (this lease is with Roland though)  If the apartment owner is CPM and [you getting your deposit back] is contingent upon [him getting his deposit back], then you might want to think about negotiating down to a half month's security deposit, unless the apartment is absolutely pristine. CPM is fairly reluctant to return security deposits at all, and often require badgering. Which is probably sensible for a company with so many tenants who are chicagoland students using their parents' money, eager to leave town as soon as possible. 

CPM kept my security deposit, but my roommate that year was unimaginably gross, so I'm not going to call that one dishonesty. I'm more basing this off friends' experiences, so treat this as a secondhand recommendation.  Is your agreement contingent on him getting his deposit back or contingent on you causing damage?

You should document well the state of the apartment when you move in, to show that any damages are not your fault.</snippet></document><document><title>How do I get an absence excused by the emergency dean?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/13vuis/how_do_i_get_an_absence_excused_by_the_emergency/</url><snippet>I missed my classes today and I haven't had to excuse my classes before, so I have no clue what I'm doing.  tell them you were in the apartment complex with the meth explosion Is that what the Illini Alert last night was aboot?   http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/deanonduty/#absences

Lunardi insider RPI #7   Look at all the other big ten teams there. We won't be there for long once conference play starts. Your name should be Not_a_optimist! he's right though -- the regular season is going to be brutal, especially if Michigan continues to be good We are already in the regular season, and it hasn't been brutal yet! Do you mean conference play? And even if we go 11-7 or 10-8 in the conference we will still get into the tourney. Let's see how we play against Gonzaga and Mizzou in the next few weeks. Those will be 2 good tests to see where this team is really at. Look at all the other big ten teams there. We won't be there for long once conference play starts. Just shows the B1G is a strong conference which will help us in March.  Look at all the other big ten teams there. We won't be there for long once conference play starts. Look at all the other big ten teams there. We won't be there for long once conference play starts.       After barely sneaking a win from Gardner-Webb?  Utter bull shit. ehhh, I see what you mean, but with the show they put on in Maui in addition to a 7-0 record, I think it is deserved. 

Also, most of the other ranked teams are not quite perfect either...for example

#13 Michigan St. won by only 3 against Louisiana Laffeyete yesterday and also have a loss.

Look at North Carolina who lost badly to Butler in Maui, and have arguably 0 strong wins...they are still ranked #14.

Moral of the story, rankings this early do not mean much, but it sure is awesome to see the Illini get some recognition for their successful trip to Hawaii and climb into the rankings after not recieving any votes in weeks prior. The performance in Maui was good.  I will lend you that, but I think the team is sporadic, at best.

This is yet another Weber-esque team, and with yet another mediocre coach from the mid-majors, we have nothing but failure in our future.  If we manage to eke out a tournament appearance it will end in tears. I guess we're coming from a different angle here, but given the terrible end to last season, and the team remaining largely the same minus a draft pick, I would consider a tourney appearance a mild success for a coach's first year.  Maybe that's just my rose colored glasses trying to find anything positive though. My issue is Groce's mediocre (at best) record in the mid-majors.  If he couldn't hack it there, he won't hack it here. What exactly about John Groce's work at Ohio suggests that he couldn't "hack it" there? He not only made the tourney 2 of the 4 years he coached there  (an impressive enough feat considering they only made the tourney 1 time between 1994 and Groce's start in 2008), but each time, beat a team that was seeded 4 or better. Not to mention he took the #1 seeded team to overtime in the Sweet Sixteen game this year. He also brought in the talent that has propelled Ohio to their 5-0 start. Similarly, he just signed an impressive recruiting class for us in a short 7 months since taking the job. I'd say he'll hack it here just fine. After barely sneaking a win from Gardner-Webb?  Utter bull shit. After barely sneaking a win from Gardner-Webb?

I get what the issue is; now I want to know what happens if TA's stop working. What classes/departments are going to be hit hardest? What happens in undergrad classes that rely on TAs for grades? What happens to those grades? What happens to the rest of the semester? Help!

  I highly doubt it; it's probably just the rumor mill working overtime in response to the controversy.  I was here for the last strike; it's a ginormous inconvenience (doubly so, given our proximity to finals week) but the university doesn't grind to a halt and foam at the mouth.  Most professors still hold classes, and exams can always have undergrad proctors instead of TAs.

STEM majors are the least affected, because those TAs don't join the GEO as much as liberal arts and social science majors do.  As engineers, I don't think we have much to worry about. I think they have to join the GEO.  I remember a TA from my research group complaining about having 2% of his pay go to the GEO, especially since he didn't like how they politicize things. 2% up to $45, not 2% straight. 2% up to $45, not 2% straight.

Wtf are they doing with that money? I probably should've asked that in the AMAA, although it wasn't completely relevant to the strike at hand. Assuming every grad is making $10000, thats $2.13 million. 2% up to $45, should change your math. 2% up to $45, should change your math. 2%? Wtf are they doing with that money? 2%?

I still think its pretty funny. Did you read the line immediately below the graph that begins the explanation of where that money goes?

It seems that we actually get a lot of benefit from those other unions. I think they have to join the GEO.

(Sorry if this has been asked before)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/13uyg8/how_stressful_is_the_cs_program_at_uiuc_sorry_if/</url><snippet>UIUC is a really strong candidate in my list of schools. I'm an out of state student living in New Jersey and I'm really attracted by the top CS rank and reasonable price that Illinois has to offer. 

However, the only thing that I'm worried of is the difficulty and workload of the program. Don't get me wrong, I'm more than willing to work hard and apply myself. I'm just wondering if I'm gonna be clawing for extra hours of sleep and spending days without seeing sunlight (My friend is doing Chemical Engineering @ UMich and that's what he described his life as, haha). I don't mind doing that a couple times, but if this occurs 9/10 days then I might have a problem since I'm still unsure how I'd handle in that type of situation.

As for my skill in CS, I've had a long term interest in computers in general and have very, VERY limited coding experience. Still, coding generally makes sense to me and I am really interested to learn more. 

Does anybody have any insightful comments to make on the rigor of the CS  at UIUC? It could help me a lot in settling myself, although to be honest I'd probably go even if you described it as hell on earth.  You might get very lonely.

I haven't talked to any girls in the past year and a half. That's only a mild exaggeration. And that is no one's fault but your own. Preach. This is a campus of 30,000 undergrads, 15,000 approximately female. You see literally hundreds of girls you have not yet ever talked to every day in the 10 minutes between every single class. So you can not say that you don't talk to girls because you can't find any.

The next thing you might argue is that there are no 'socially acceptable' ways to talk to girls. I call bullshit, and I will name three:

1) Almost every lecture hall class has group projects, or at least projects where you can work with at least one partner. You could ask almost any girl in the class if she would like to work with you on something. Granted, there may be a smaller percentage of females in a CS class, but I have yet to find a CS class with over 100 students that has 0 girls. Also, she might say "no, I'm working with someone else," but that's fairly unlikely and there are other options and other girls in the class.

2) You can join student groups. Sure, CS groups generally also have a smaller female percentage, but most groups of decent size have at least some girls. Then, there are non-CS student groups which you could join, and women in almost all of them. Hell, if you really care about talking to women, go to Women in CS open office hours. You don't even have to leave Siebel! That group has a majority of female members! They've even got an Xbox with kinect so you can play dancing games with the girls there! 

3) You can go to public areas and meet women. If you live in a dorm, you can go to the lobby. If you don't live in a dorm, you can go to a dorm, wait for someone to swipe their iCard, then follow them into the lobby. There are lounges in the union, there are rest places in Siebel, and countless other public hang-out places I don't even know about. All of these places you know about, or could've easily found out about. Once you are in a public place, you can talk to anyone you please, and unless they ask you to leave them alone (as long as you're moderately pleasant, they most likely won't), you can keep talking to them until they have to leave.

You also might argue that you're too busy to talk to girls. Yeah right. Unless you have two jobs, are taking 18 credit hours, and won't be happy with anything less than a 4.0, you will have free time. You might choose to spend this free time, say, on reddit instead of talking to girls, but you will have at least some time. But even if you choose to spend your free time not talking to girls, you still have option 1 up above.

So I have preached, I have defended my case. If you never talk to girls, it is no one's fault but your own.

And on one's going to read this because it's in a two day old thread, practically dead. Damn. I said preach and you preached. Good stuff man. Too bad nobody is going to read it haha. You might get very lonely.

If you rely exclusively on classes to meet people, you're not gonna meet many girls in most engineering majors. Doesn't matter what school, CS does not attract women in general.

Basically, if you are naturally outgoing and have good time management, you're set for any/all majors.

Time management is literally the most important thing in college. Most people who are overworked in college either procrastinate or take on way too many extracurricular responsibilities. 

Go to class, take notes, do homework/study early, and you should be fine. A guy told me he thought I was smarter than him; well, he came into college with insane time management and I just rode my "intelligence" through high school. I went from incoming James Scholar to academic probation in 2 years, only just now climbing out of the hole I dug. He destroyed all of his classes and still finds time to do everything he wants to. Pretty sure he's the smart one, not me.

Fuck it, I already typed too much:

rawnoodles10 guide to college based on his mistakes and others' success:

* Go to class, take notes (even mindless copying counts), do your hw/projects early. Starting early means you can go to office hours and ask the professor questions, I know a CS major that finished her huge project the first week it was assigned because she just kept asking the prof when she got stuck. You cannot do this 3 hours before the thing is due.

* Rely on extracurriculars/dorm/friend's friends to meet people. You aren't going to see the same people in class till junior level classes, inverse is true for female/male ratio in engineering. You will probably know much fewer people overall than you did in high school.

* Just get the default meal plan, I never saw anyone actually able to avoid wasting credits on the bigger ones. You're going to hate dorm food 1-2 months in. Same crap over and over. Rent yourself housing and learn to cook. Don't rent at CPM.

* At UIUC, you don't need a car. Bus (pass included in tuition) can take you a block from anywhere, or bike. 

* Don't be afraid to talk to professors. They're generally pretty laidback and friendly. You can easily get research by looking up a profesor doing something interesting and knocking on their office door.

* It's ok to fuck up. Grade replacement/dropping classes can let you catch up.

* Doesn't hurt to ask, you can get a lot of stuff by just asking for it. Just don't bullshit. If you rely exclusively on classes to meet people, you're not gonna meet many girls in most engineering majors. Doesn't matter what school, CS does not attract women in general.

* Doesn't hurt to ask, you can get a lot of stuff by just asking for it. Just don't bullshit. I would add to this list:

* Form study groups to do homeworks, MPs and to prepare for quizzes and exams. It is a sort of defense against procrastination because someone in your group is likely to be more conscientious and push you to start working on assignments early. It is more fun and less stress to study in a group, and you also get to know people and make friends that way.

* Good grades are not about intelligence (you already have the required level if you get admitted to UIUC). They are about time management, organizational skills, networking (forming study groups, etc.). These soft skills will also be very useful later in life, in fact probably more than technical skills after a point.

* UIUC is a good university with tons of resources to help you. Make use of those! Go to office hours, in fact, if possible, I would say go to office hours even if you were able to do the homework without help. Concepts are often reiterated in office hours and you might learn something new or understand something better just by going to office hours and observing the professor or TA answering someone else's questions. Grainger has study rooms, areas where you are allowed to talk and discuss - utilize those resources. 

* Do not take on more courseload than you are able to manage. You don't want to be miserable and stressed out trying to get your courses done sooner.

* Have a life and interests outside your major. Join an RSO or some other club/activity/sports, but don't take on too many extracurricular activities.  I thought I covered all those.

'Cept study groups, those are good too. If you rely exclusively on classes to meet people, you're not gonna meet many girls in most engineering majors. Doesn't matter what school, CS does not attract women in general.

If you manage your time well this won't happen as often. But the thing is people who actually enjoy those hours struggling trying to finish an mp (machine problems, just a fancy word for CS hw) will do well in this field. You should come give it a shot and see how you do. If you don't like it we have other solid programs as well.

Also I didn't do much coding before I attended UIUC. It shouldn't be a problem.  If you manage your time, you'll be fine.

I started in Aviation, transferred to Engineering for CS after two years while finishing up the Aviation program and did the Marching Illini and Basketball and Volleyball bands on top of that.  Spent an extra year to finish up, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

Do keep in mind that it is many ways a very theoretical program.  The focus is not on coding.. it's on the principles behind the coding.  Algorithms, Data Structures, and Hardware are all areas of emphasis.  I've heard it said that the Bachelor's program covers material that many other colleges cover in their Master's CS program.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  You'll be expected to pick up the languages that a given course is taught in as you go -- the focus isn't the language, the language is the tool to cover the material at hand.  Some people do well with that approach (I did).  Others do not.  It's an amazing program. If you manage your time properly and start assignments early, you never have to stay up late. However, once you reach sophomore year, second semester, it pretty much evolves from being a major into being a lifestyle. If you're okay, with CS related stuff dominating a majority of your time and your life then go for it. Also, people within CS are not exactly the most social. But I'm an international student so my experiences might be a little different. That's actually pretty worrying...

It always seems to me like CS people aren't necessarily the worst people as a whole, but the worst people do seem to be CS people.  I concur. Obviously I can't generalize and make a statement for the population as a whole. I only have anecdotal evidence, but some of the ones I know have poor social skills and somewhat of an attitude problem (God's gift to mankind kind of attitude). It doesn't get better after they have finished undergrad, either, they stay the same later on, too. Watch "The Social Network" for an in-depth understanding; I don't know if it is representative of CS majors but it matches my experience and observations.

TL; DR: CS major good for employability, bad for social, interpersonal and life skills. You would probably have to put in conscious, extra effort into socialization to make sure your social skills progress beyond the high school-level skills that you came in with. Good for employability, bad for life skills, which include knowing how to get a job.  I never did really learn that one.. and so, I'm in graduate school, where I can still survive without knowing how to do that.  I think I'm kind of odd in that respect though.. most people got quite a few offers all the time it seemed. That's unusual - I thought getting into UIUC CS grad school was harder than getting a job. I'm not in UIUC graduate school, I'm somewhere else.  But I think it was a number of things--I'd rather go to graduate school than be a software engineer because of the things I want to do, so I had more drive to push myself toward that; also, it's a different style of applying--no talking to recruiters and handing out resumes, which I found kind of difficult and which made me nervous all the time.

I always wonder if I should just become a software engineer though... I'm sure I could get a job easily if I applied to a bunch of places and they do make more money, but I'd feel like I'd be stuck doing that forever and I never really wanted to in the first place. If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes. Eh, I don't think that's completely true.  There are definitely some alpha nerds who think they're ~~God's~~ Stallman's gift to the world, but they're typically holed up in the ACM office.  For the most part, I found that people were friendly and helpful.  Finding the right group of people to work with is key. &amp;gt; There are definitely some alpha nerds who think they're ~~God's~~ Stallman's gift to the world, but they're typically holed up in the ACM office.

...right along with a good number of decent people.  Some of the same people, in fact, that you're claiming are friendly and helpful. Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that everyone in ACM is a douche. The few people I ever got any sort of hostility from seemed to always be in ACM, **but**, as you say, most are very friendly and helpful; I should have made that clear. 

The point is, FightingDucks was pretty liberal - or, rather, *wrong* - with his numbers by saying 90% of the people in CS are assholes.  It's much, much smaller than that.

If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes. You publicly state that you're better than 90% of your classmates... and yet you think they're the stuck up assholes. no not better by any means at CS, hell i struggle to get by in it.  More social than 90% and have better personal skills, yes.  [deleted] Personal skills usually involve communication in person and not over an anonymous forum so this is not any indication. The whole concept of anonymous online forums is to be able to say whatever you want without worrying about the people around you taking offense and knowing who you are.  [deleted] Caring about something has nothing to do with personal skills, that just has to do with being a caring person who can show signs of empathy or sympathy.  And insult or not, it is true and OP asked about the program.  Im going to be honest and give my opinion which I stand by.  And as for the insulting people in a forum many of them read, I still think it was a good idea.  As you pointed out that many CS people read this, OP's chance of getting any honest responses that aren't just building up this program greatly decrease.  Are you that butthurt that about me saying that you are probably in this group who lacks interpersonal and social skills in real human interaction as opposed to communication behind the safety of your computer screen? [deleted] As stated before, I do not consider myself to be better than everyone else is.  I also doubt that we know each other, however that would be interesting wouldn't it. I am just saying that from my own personal interactions with CS undergrads, about 90% were very anti-social and came off as that god's gift to earth type.  That isnt to say that all CS people are like that, it is very possible that I have just had poor luck and that these are the ones I have interacted with. If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes. Is this your opinion or just the common mindset shared by most of the student body? I just posted this above but here is my opinion/ personal experiences...

I stand by statement. I'm in CS so I have had plenty of interactions with other CS students. Perhaps 90% overall was a bit too high of a number but from my own personal experiences, I have met 1 or maybe 2 people in CS that weren't "Gods gift to earth, I'm better than you, assholes." 

Also I guess there are some experiences that sum it up better than others. For example just  a few weeks ago in lecture I tried to start a conversation with the guy next to me before the class started, all he responded with was "what the fuck do you want go bother someone else."  Also last year in a discussion section some kid asked a question (maybe not the best question but that is what discussion sections are for) and one kid stood up and cussed the kid out calling him a dipshit who was making "all of us smart kids in CS look bad."  If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes.   If you want a fantastic social life (ie. go out 3 nights a week), a CS major is the farthest thing from it, 

Consider studying Information Systems in the College of Business if you want a great social life and are interested in computers (especially in more general terms).    I don't think there is anything "reasonable" about UIUC's out of state tuition... 

 I'm an out of state student. U of I's rate for us is much lower than public schools in other schools for students that wish to study out of state. When I was considering different schools, I do believe that Georgia Tech was about $4k/yr less than U of I though.  Its great. The classes are extremely easy and there are a ton of girls everywhere.

Edit: Ok, on a serious note. There are plenty of assholes in CS of course, and you have to find the people that aren't assholes- but that's not hard. And don't take the gender ratio jokes seriously- the majority of my CS friends are girls (I'm a guy) and this is purely by accident, not because I only try to make friends with girls. Of course there gender ratio is pretty skewed, but its not impossible to work around. (Basically, if you're going into CS for girls you're doing it very wrong, but as long as you have some sort of social presence, you shouldn't have to worry about it.)

There's a good mix of everything from the "hardware" side to the "theory" side of the spectrum, and a lot of programming in between. As for having prior experience, I came in with very little and I'm doing pretty fine. There's plenty of work, of course, but that's to be expected. You will learn a lot; its not like professors give you busy work, or strange problems where you have no idea why you're supposed to be doing this. &amp;gt; the majority of my CS friends are girls (I'm a guy) and this is purely by accident, not because I only try to make friends with girls

You must love soaking up karma by riding all my comments -_- No, I just like seeing you get downvoted. Its great. The classes are extremely easy and there are a ton of girls everywhere.

EDIT: thanks for the answers guys  I don't think you understand how being a TA works in grad school. You are paid (let's say in a STEM field something around $2k/month) to be a TA with a "50% appointment", meaning you are supposed to spend 50% of your time TAing. The other 50% of your time (in reality, this takes up a lot more than 20 additional hours per week) is research, but you don't get paid for that time....  If you assume a TA works a combined 40hrs/wk, which is a gross underestimate for anyone I've met, that's something like $13/hour. In the sciences you are usually prohibited from having another job because you're expected to spend all your time on research. The wage you earn from TAing is your only income.

For those asking why a tuition waiver guarantee is necessary... it is laughable to consider what would happen if the university took waivers away. Any student who had any other options for grad school would not be paying to come here when other schools will pay to have you. This means no students to do research, no one to produce work for PIs who need work done to win more grants... in the long term, no warm bodies to do teaching and no more grant money coming in. You may question why some grad students get paid, while professional students have to pay... it doesn't even really matter. It is the way it is, and if UIUC doesn't comply, it will lose students to the vast majority of schools that still do. I don't think you understand how being a TA works in grad school.

I'm pretty sure these tuition waivers don't necessarily apply to STEM graduate students. I talked to a few, they said they get paid through their PI's grants and TAing is usually an extra source of income. I don't think tuition is ever a problem for STEM field graduate students. As a STEM graduate student, I didn't always get paid through my PI's grants and TAing was not an extra source of income. 

Usually, you TA the first few semesters for your salary, then you are put on as a research assistant and the salary comes from your PI somewhere. But there's no additional money if you TA. It just changes where your salary comes from. That could change from dept to dept.

Agreed that tuition is (usually) not a problem in my field... but then if this issue is not about grad students keeping their existing tuition waivers, what is it about?

My friend who TAs ECE190 makes ~700/month, and I'm pretty sure ECE is a STEM field that should be making ~2k/month. -_- Is your friend a grad student? Is your friend getting paid for a research position at the same time? yes and yes  you can't buy food/pay rent  with a tuition waiver. you can't buy food/pay rent  with a tuition waiver. Just playing devil's advocate here: Law/Med students take out loans to pay tuition. Why should it be different for graduate students? A full-time TA gets paid 29K according to the link posted below, this is a very liveable wage for central Illinois. 

Obviously tuition is absurd and a modest TA salary is not a reasonable way to pay for tuition and live. But shouldn't they be separate? Why shouldn't the situation be viewed the same as an undergrad delivering Sandwiches: Take out loans for tuition that you'll pay back later, and get a part-time job to pay for living expenses in the meantime.

Law/med students don't teach, thus don't get waivers. Graduate students don't automatically get waivers, only if they are employed as a TA/RA/GA. 

Not all TA's are full time. I believe that the GEO wants part time GAs to have a liveable wage (since not all GAs get full time appointments).

Again, I don't feel this way - but this logic makes sense to me.  The issue is about protecting tuition waivers, but here are the [numbers](http://www.ahr.illinois.edu/grads/GEO1213rates.pdf).

If you want to actually understand the GEO's position, you can read [this](http://www.uigeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TuitionWaiverFAQfront.jpg). From that link - it seems like taking away the tuition waivers is breaking the contract they signed. Isn't that illegal? If this is the case, wouldn't court be the best option as opposed to trying to reason with the school?

Also, does this only affect grad students in Fine and Applied Arts? Someone could correct me here, but I think the issues is not the current contract, because the current contract provides for the tuition waivers.

The issue now is that the school and the GEO is working on a new contract, but the school administration does not want to include tuition waivers for all TA's/RA's/GA's whatever.

Edit: Mixed up GEO and admin. &amp;gt; but the GEO does not want to include tuition waivers

The GEO wants tuition waivers for all TA's/GA's holding 25-67% appointments.
 From that link - it seems like taking away the tuition waivers is breaking the contract they signed. Isn't that illegal? If this is the case, wouldn't court be the best option as opposed to trying to reason with the school?

Also, does this only affect grad students in Fine and Applied Arts? And thanks for the links by the way  I would like to address a little bit about your question of the necessity of a tuition waiver. The base stipend in my department is 20k pretax, and unless you get additional fellowship, this is all you get. We get minimally taxed on that, but heavily taxed on *any additional scholarship we get over the base stipend**. We also pay all the student fees that for the most part, we don't really benefit from anyway.

So we are now at about 17k a year. For a 25 year old with a modest student loan, I can live on it well enough to afford to share an apartment and a car with my boyfriend and an annual trip home to see my aging parents. 

If the tuition waiver was taken away, I would not be afford to live. Not without a loan anyway. This is not the deal I signed on to give up other opportunities. Sure, 20k for a 50% appointment sounds like a lot, but nobody I know--at illinois or anywhere else, actually work 20h and not expected to be kicked out of grad school (I know people who had been asked to leave for this reason). I would say between the engineering and science grads I know, we work between 40-80 hours a week because that's what academia demands of us.

I went to a well ranked undergrad program and I have an impressive enough cv to get into this school. I can confidently say that if I wasn't offered financial support here, I would have ditched this for a fully funded program 5 ranks lower. Or not go to grad school at all. And this is representative of the sentiment among my social circles. If this school wants to flush its academic reputation down the toilet, this would be a good way to go. 

Edit because my memory failed me. TAs and RAs don't pay taxes on the waiver.  [deleted] Have you read past the first line?

&amp;gt; This taxation does not apply to qualified Teaching Assistants or Research Assistants.   If I remember correctly, they make just under $17,000 a year, which is the poverty line. (A TA of mine had a long talk about this.) As an LAS TA, I make just under $12,000 a year.  Not all of us are in STEM.</snippet></document><document><title>What's the likelihood that my late drop/class withdrawal will be accepted?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/13ubyb/whats_the_likelihood_that_my_late_dropclass/</url><snippet>Anybody done this before?
