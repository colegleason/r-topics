I just thought you ladies would enjoy hearing about this small step towards more equal representation in industry! In addition to my other qualifications, the owner of the winery also said that he and his wife really wanted to see more ladies working in this field! Hopefully this will lead to more women working in this industry as well. :)

Edit: I can PM anyone the winery info if they want it! I'm just trying not to get too specific on here in plain view. ;)

Edit 2: Thank you all for the wonderful outpouring of support. &amp;lt;3  Well, what kind of wine is it? Can we get a brand so we can celebrate you? :P We are a brand new baby winery so we aren't quite shipping to stores yet! We are in the process of beginning to distribute though. :)
We are based in Indiana and make wines from a lot of varieties of grape which are native to the state. Would you be willing to PM me the location of your winery or tell me if you plan on shipping to Ohio? Cherry wine and rieslings are favorites of mine. 

And congrats! This is so exciting for you! If there's one good thing Michigan has, it's cherry rieslings...maybe Indiana will fill that void for us so we don't have to buy from up north. Would you be willing to PM me the location of your winery or tell me if you plan on shipping to Ohio? Cherry wine and rieslings are favorites of mine.

 Seconded! Where are you!?  Indiana. We specialize in grapes that are native to our state, although we also have more traditional wines such as Riesling. 

My favorite is actually our cherry wine, which is tasty without being too sweet and has a nice spice note at the end. It's also great with chocolate!

EDIT: Too many "also"s and fixed the location to be less specific as per posting rules Um...cherry wine? That sounds delicious! :) Aside from this one, you should check out northern Michigan vintners. *Lots* of cherry wines up there. Yes! That is actually where we normally get our cherries from. Seconded! Where are you!?  Yay! I love wine! Which state?
    My liver and I would like to know how to get into this trade.   That's awesome! Just wondering, why isn't the the wife considered the first female in your state? Is she not actually a winemaker? She is actually a schoolteacher who comes in and helps when she is not teaching. From what I understand, she is not involved in the winemaking process; she tries to keep things running smoothly up front in the tasting/retail area.

As of right now, the only technical staff working at the winery are the owner and myself. Gotcha! Thanks for the response and congrats :D   Yay! What state? Do we get a Reddit discount ;)    Congratulations!!    That is really great, congratulations!        Congratulations!!

I was just in IN this summer and stopped in Bloomington. I stopped in a homebrew shop (I'm a homebrewer, beer/wine/cider no wine -- YET), which doubled as a tasting room for Butler winery. The woman in the shop was SO excited about all the local grapes. I'm not a huge fan of midwestern wines (norton, chambourcin, etc) but she had so much passion for it. I really enjoyed my visit with her. And when she found out that I live in Missouri where Norton is king, she was super-excited to share that Indiana is trying to make Chambourcin the "indiana wine" much like MO has done with Norton.

Good luck to you, and congratulations! Your excitement really shines :) I don't know if there's anything like this for winemakers, but in brewing there is a Pink Boots society to support women in professional brewing. Maybe you could look into something like that -just a thought!

Cheers to you  Thank you! And thanks for the information. :)

We do have Chambourcin here, but our Traminette is more well-known! It is my understanding that Traminette is known as the "Indiana wine" right now. Both the grape in general and our particular version of it have done pretty well at the Indy wine competition recently!     Awesome!  But at the same time, it's sad to think that there are still states (or were, if this was the last one) without any female winemakers in 2013.    </snippet></document><document><title>I just unlocked the door to a six-figure salary</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197790/i_just_unlocked_the_door_to_a_sixfigure_salary/</url><snippet>I'm mid-career, no husband or kids, so I decided to really get serious at work. Well, it's taken time and a job change, but I finally landed something with potential. I've been floundering for a while and was becoming dishearted by my lack of progress, then last week *BAM!* I knocked one out of the park. This success won't change my circumstances overnight, but it's gives me the credibility and acheivement I can post on a resume, which in turn will lead me to higher paying jobs in the future.

I am really stoked and super excited for my success. I come from a blue collar family and was the first to attend college.

For the Curious: Not sure the job matters, as lots of jobs lead to higher wages. I'm an IT Project Manager, though, for anyone who is wondering if my claim is valid. I'm not at all surprised by the initial nay sayers.

EDIT: You guys are awesome. Someone said that it was sad I had to contextualize this by saying I don't have a husband or kids, but think about it - I have never celebrated anything. I can't share my success with my family for a variety of reasons, so I wanted to toot my own horn and give inspiration to all the gals out there who are trying their best to do something for themselves and their careers. Thank you TwoX!  Awwww yiss! Welcome to the club. One suggestion I'd like to make is as you progress in seniority, consider mentoring younger women to help them up the ladder too. Female networks are sadly lacking and they are so crucial to getting us into management. Congrats :) Awwww yiss! Welcome to the club.

So the suspense is killing me and I'm sure everyone else: what's this new career change?

Because, and I'm probably being cynical, your post sounds a little like an advertisement. So do give details. Congrats!

Please share how you did this/your career path here or in private message, because it could be very helpful to me. I've been in IT Project Management for, well, *many* years now. I've transitioned to agile processes, so technically I'm a ScrumMaster these days. That said, here's my two-bit thoughts on becoming an IT PM.

1) Agile PM is where it's at right now, at least in my world. Get your CSM, or at the very least, read up on agile practices and know how agile projects work. 

2) Check out your local Project Management Institute (PMI) chapter. Go to a few meetings, see what folks in your area are saying, doing, offering regarding project management. Network - it really does pay off. 

3) Consider getting your PMP (Project Management Professional) certification. It's not cheap, and the test is stupid hard, but it shows you know your stuff and that you are committed to a project management career. This was the tipping point for me. 

4) You have an IS degree? Can you code? Get a job programming somewhere and show that you are an organized leader. (Note: my degree isn't even close to being IT-related.)

5) A couple of stepping-stone titles to consider: project coordinator and web producer. 

6) Not sure about your company, but, if this is applicable, find a project that your department needs and volunteer to lead it. My guess is there is something you can do to make your job more efficient. 

7) Related to 6, if desktop support needs are considered for development projects, volunteer as a stakeholder.  Sorry to be nosey, but I am going back to school in the fall (finally) and What does CSM mean? As of right now I am going for a bachelors in Computer Science.  Will that degree set me up for what you are talking about?  Again, sorry for asking probably basic questions but I really want to be proactive about my education and what comes after it.  Hi! I'm a Project Coordinator right now, and this post really made my day. Great job! And best of luck with what comes next. I hope you've seen a PC move up within your own organization?

I've been with my current company for 13 years. The most I've seen a PC move to was in-field Project Engineer. Even the ones that went back to school for PM courses. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I hope you have room for advancement! For whatever it's worth, I'm a PC who just got an internal promotion to a Business Systems Analyst role and a 20% increase in pay to go with it. 

I've still got a long way to go to that six-figure mark, but now that I've crossed the hourly/salary divide with my company I'm exempt and hoping I might actually have time to take a couple of courses and then start working on a graduate degree to take me even further.

I'm a Project Coordinator right now, and this post really made my day. Great job! And best of luck with what comes next. I started as a project coordinator.   For some reason reading this made my day. Go you! I'm finishing law school and dreading the job hunt right now, but I know someday I will be enjoying success stories like these. :) Congrats!   When you get the chance, can you unlock the back window so I can sneak in as well?     Wow, congrats! I have to ask: I am a NON IT Project Manager. I am not an engineer or IT technical person, but I feel I'm a damned good PM. How do I break out of my subfield into IT/Construction/what have you?

   Can you tell me a little about your educational background?  My fiance is talking about going back to school for IT stuff.  It's hard to figure out what kind of program he should look for.  Some websites say just teach yourself all the computer programs with free online tutorials, others recommend different certifications.  I know there are vocational programs, and you're saying you went to college.  As someone succeeding in IT, can you give some advice about what he should do to get into your field?  Thanks! I have a BA and some grad work in Public Administration. I'm not sure how to advise another as to how to get into the field because I dont see many people entering the field.  If I may ask what was the career process like? I am current a software developer but looking to move to being a PM and am asking for all the advice i can find.          Project Management for the win! Right now I'm doing operations for Service Desk, so I deal with you folks a lot. Not sure if I want to do Project Management, Service Management, or Delivery Leadership.

Either way! One more lady in a sparsely populated field! Congratulations!

If I can ask, are you PMI, PMP, or PMO certified? Any other certifications?

This honestly made my day. I am in training, earning my hours toward a PMP.  Check out /r/girlsgonewired!              CONGRATS!!!! GOOD LUCK TO YOU!!! That's awesome.

I want her to consider it but want to respect her choices too!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/196xk9/how_can_i_bring_up_birth_control_when_my/</url><snippet>Throwaway for obvious reasons.

TL;DR: Gf won't go on birth control or even visit a doctor about it because she's afraid of doctors and thinks condoms alone are safe enough, even though we have a bad habit of sometimes relying on me being able to 'control myself'.

Me (18/M) and my SO (17/f) have been having sex for nearly 3 months, dating for 7 and a half, and we have been ridiculously stupid about safety up until now. I'm relatively clued up about the risks of sex without protection etc, however in the moment I still find myself having penetrative sex without a condom. I know how unsafe this is, and it's stupidly immature of me and over the last month or so I've either used a condom or simply not had PIV sex. Recently my mother inquired as to our birth control situation, and I told her that we only used condoms; her working in a clinic that regularly deals with teen pregnancy means that she has a somewhat experienced view of how dangerous the use of solely condoms can be, and I respect that, and she somewhat strongly suggested we visit a doctor and see what we can do about better BC. This came as somewhat of an eye opener and I really need to find a more reliable way of having safe sex. I've done my research and even with condoms we're looking at 2-3% annual failure rates which is still a risk I'm not satisfied with taking.

I've brought up the matter of BC before, but normally my SO will evade the question or change the topic. I get the impression she's uncomfortable talking about it, and I know for a fact that she's afraid of the doctors. However, just this morning I had a conversation with her about birth control, and ended up getting frustrated at how little she seemed to know and care about the risks, and frankly it turned into an argument. I've spent the morning researching so I can give her some facts to maybe show her how much of a risk we're taking even with condoms, but I'm afraid she'll take it as me pushing BC on her, which is what I think she has in her head already, and I really don't want to control what she does to her body.

My view of the matter is that sex involves both of us, to have sex we both need to be on the same page when it comes to preventing pregnancy. We're both virgins so STIs are a relatively small issue, although condoms will be continued to be used as a preventative regardless. I feel like it's up to her what she does with her body, I understand that most forms of BC are intrusive to women, especially the hormone heavy ones, for example the pill and most implants. I'm aware of methods such as the copper implant, Mirena, the some IUDs that don't use hormones, but I'm not sure if she's first of all aware of these, or if she has any issues with them either, which is something that would be addressed best by a trip to the doctors. At the same time as respecting her body and her wishes, I want her to respect mine. If by a mutual act she does become pregnant, I'm powerless to decide if she has the child or not, for this reason I feel I should have some say as to how safely we do things, and I've since told her that until we're safer than just condoms I'm not comfortable with PIV sex. Also my mum has taken matter into her own hands now that she's found out my GF still hasn't made any effort to discuss BC with a doctor and has told me she doesn't want us sleeping over each others houses anymore.

I've told her I want to visit the doctors purely to talk about the risks of sex with only condoms, and discuss possible means of BC, but she's having none of it, saying 'do what you want, it doesn't matter how I feel, etc'. I've reached the point where I've told her it's her choice what she does with her body, I just want her to come along to the doctors with me in the hope that they can convince her to at least think about it, and that if we don't take measures other than condoms to be safe then I don't feel comfortable having PIV sex. She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to, I know she has a tendency to be clingy sometimes but that genuinely frightened me because I'm in no way ready to even contemplate a child yet.

This is driving a rift between her and my mum, but she doesn't even know it. My mum is getting increasingly frustrated with her not seeing the doctor about it, but I daren't tell my girlfriend just how much she's irritating my parents as she would take offence and probably not want to come over anymore. It's also causing problems for me, I don't fully understand how it's such a big deal, but I know for a fact I can't begin to understand how scary it could be going on BC when all she hears from friends are horror stories.

Basically what I want advice with is how to get her to visit the doctors with me, how I can carry on trying to get her to at least address the issue without appearing forceful, and what birth control methods are a possibility (besides the pill as she would definitely forget to take it too much).

Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and please help me, I just want what's best for both of us!


**Edit: I've effectively said without a second form of contraceptive on top of proper condom use, I'm no longer comfortable having PIV sex, she's taking this as me not wanting sex with her anymore and that I don't want to be with her despite me saying otherwise, any tips for getting around this also?**
  &amp;gt;She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to

Sorry, what? 'it doesn't matter how I feel about it, as long as you're in the clear so you are free to leave me whenever you want'

Those were here exact words, I never mentioned anything about leaving her, but she has some serious insecurities so this probably stems from those. I countered with the fact that I wouldn't be wanting a long term birth control solution if I wanted to leave her.

My problem with this is that it sounded like if she got pregnant she'd keep it so I had to stay, not sure if it's my paranoia or she was going OAG on me there, but either way it scared me quite a lot and reinforced my opinion of needing better BC. You may need to bring up the fact that kid or no kid, you (or anyone else she dates) can leave her.  Getting pregnant is no way to guarantee that a boyfriend will stay with her or that it would make for a happy home life for her and the kid.  It seems like she's being emotionally manipulative with this.  

My concern is that even if you do manage to talk her into seeing a doctor and she agrees to take some form of birth control, can you honestly trust her to be consistent with it or not tamper with it in the hopes of getting pregnant just so that you'll "stay"?  Really think about if this is a relationship worth pursuing and if you can really trust your girlfriend in this matter.  It may be better that you cut ties with her now before you become even more emotionally invested in this relationship.  

This isn't an easy decision, but think of how having a child with this girl will impact the rest of your life (especially if she gets pregnant while you're both still in school)--do you have a job that could support it even if you don't stay with her (don't expect your parents/her parents to bail you out), how will having a kid effect your prospects for further schooling if you do want to go to college/trade school (and the quality of job/career you could get income-wise) , always having to have her in your life regardless of having a new girlfriend/wife one day, if she's being manipulative with you then she'd do that to any kid she has and would you be cool with that?

Just some important things to really think about.  You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and it's great that you are researching your options and getting all of the info that you can to make an informed decision.  Good luck.

 edit: a word Thanks for this, I'm currently studying at university and definitely could not support a child, I'm fully aware the ramifications of a child would not be good right now, which is why I want to avoid an accident. I don't think she's mature enough to have a sexual relationship. You seem to be very mature. Perhaps this is a sign you should move on.

[deleted] Hold on. She's 17. She doesn't sound psycho, she sounds very young and very inexperienced. Young girls think and say crazy shit because they are full of crazy hormones that they don't know how to handle. 

She needs some SERIOUS education on the matter, but lets hold off on painting a young girl with the "psycho" brush.  I think the bottom line is that she isn't mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, whether she's 17 or 37. 

OP should get out now. I was coming here to say this very thing.  Not only is she not mature enough I'm doubting OP is mature enough.  I mean he's making the conscious decision to not wear a condom despite his awareness of what could happen. Well, it sounds like he's made a choice not to do this anymore, and is looking for advice on how to convince her to go to the dr. with him. That sounds miles more mature than 'I don't want to talk about it, because you only want to have sex with me and then leave me'.

What would your advice to him be? Mine would be for him to move on, not having those magic words that will make a girl grow the fuck up. Hold on. She's 17. She doesn't sound psycho, she sounds very young and very inexperienced. Young girls think and say crazy shit because they are full of crazy hormones that they don't know how to handle. 

She needs some SERIOUS education on the matter, but lets hold off on painting a young girl with the "psycho" brush.  No matter her age, I think we can agree that there are some serious red flags here. Just because she may grow out of it doesn't mean that OP should stick around to find out. An just because she's young doesn't mean she's not being emotionally manipulative and controlling. Youth and hormones may explain her behavior, but it doesn't excuse it and it doesn't change the potential consequences for OP if this situation continues along this path. Absolutely. But we still do not need to CALL HER NAMES. 

This is supposed to be a female-friendly place, and nobody seems to mind calling a young girl "psycho" because she's making poor choices? 

Honestly, what the hell? Whatever happened to a little compassion and empathy? Did nobody here ever make poor choices and think they didn't deserve to be called names over it? 

Kids do stupid shit. It's what makes them kids. They have not yet finished developing the consequence portion of their brains. And somehow, it's okay to demonize her because she's doing dumb shit? 

If I sound frustrated, it's because I am. 

She clearly has a lot to learn, and if she's not willing to back down, then one if the more harsh lessons may be getting dumped because she's unwilling to learn any other way. 

But can we PLEASE stop calling people names for making dumb choices that are fairly normal for a 17 yr old girl? (And note that "normal" here does not mean "right".)
 I agree that we can stop calling her names, but I also wouldn't call veiled threats to purposefully get pregnant "normal" for a 17 year old girl. It's not normal, it's not healthy, and we shouldn't treat it as such.

My problem with this is that it sounded like if she got pregnant she'd keep it so I had to stay, not sure if it's my paranoia or she was going OAG on me there, but either way it scared me quite a lot and reinforced my opinion of needing better BC.

When interacting with people who don't communicate clearly, especially young ones, remember this: The message is contained in the behavior.

If she doesn't want to take birth control, she wants to get pregnant. Despite any verbal protests. The reasons she verbalizes don't matter. Only her behavior does.

What is the 'it' in her statement above? If 'it' = getting pregnant, then everything else makes sense.

'It doesn't matter how I feel about the possibility of me getting pregnant, as long as you're in the clear (if I don't get pregnant) so you are free to leave me whenever you want'

If she suddenly changes her mind, I would be very suspicious. If she only pretends to take birth control, or 'forgets' often enough to reduce their effectiveness, then what?

She gets what she wants, which is keeping you around to assuage her insecurities.

Sorry, what? &amp;gt;She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to

Sorry, what? Yeah, this is a warning sign dude. Break up with her. Usually, I disagree with the rampant "you should immediately break up with him/her" replies in Reddit relationship advice threads, because I believe everyone should try working things out first, and people here are too quick to say to jump ship.

I think this is probably close to the first time I've immediately thought "That's unhealthy, you need to *not* be dating this girl." &amp;gt;you need to *not* be dating this girl.&amp;lt;  

You need to not be sleeping with this girl.

 Yeah, this is a warning sign dude. Break up with her. Totally agree. Maybe she wants a baby to keep him around? &amp;gt;She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to

Sorry, what?  If I were in your position I would tell her that she can make her own decision for her body, but you are also entitled to make decisions about yours, and that you're simply not comfortable continuing to have PIV sex using only condoms.  So she can choose between abstinence or another form of contraception. I've tried this line of approach but she felt pressured and refused to carry on discussing it at this point, so really it got me nowhere, thanks for the advice though! BOTH of you have the right to do or not do whatever you want with your own bodies. She has the right to say she won't use birth control, and you have the right to not have sex with her as a result. 

Also this:

&amp;gt; She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to

is seriously disturbing. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT to end the relationship whenever you want, for whatever reason. If she doesn't respect that, and is threatening to trap you with a baby, I think you should seriously reconsider whether it's worth staying with her.

I've tried this line of approach but she felt pressured and refused to carry on discussing it at this point, so really it got me nowhere, thanks for the advice though! What about the two great, non-hormonal, mildly invasive options out there: cervical caps and diaphragms?

She does have to go to a doctor to get fitted, but that's it. But there are no pills, you pop them in before sex, ease them out afterwards. Often, people recommend using a spermicide after removal to catch any stray semen leftover. But she wouldn't have to remember a pill or have anything implanted. When you put on your condom, she puts in her diaphragm or cervical cap, and then you can go at it.

Also, if y'all are sexually active, she needs to start seeing an ob/gyn anyways. If she's not mature enough to take care of the basic health needs brought about by having sex, she isn't mature enough to be having sex.

My personal motto is 'If we can't talk about it, we can't do it,' and talking about protection and coming to a comfortable compromise is a necessary part of 'talking about it.' If she's only 17, she doesn't technically "need" to see an OB/GYN. Newer guidelines by the World Health Organization say a woman should have her first exam at 21 regardless of sexual activity. Though getting to know one certainly wouldn't hurt.

I've tried this line of approach but she felt pressured and refused to carry on discussing it at this point, so really it got me nowhere, thanks for the advice though! Sorry if this has been asked (there are a lot of comments!), but did you mean it? Like, if you don't start using another form of birth control, will you still continue to have sex with her? If the answer is no then tell her very plainly that you will not have sex again until another form of contraception is added to the mix, and actually follow up on it. You're not obligated to have sex with her, or anyone else. I meant it and will stand by it, while I enjoy sex it's not something I need, I managed 18 years without and if it means I'm safe then I'll happily do without it again

And yet another great example of the need for male birth control. 

(like, seriously, it would solve so many problems.)

I think you've gotten good advice from people here: it comes down to the fact that you're in a position of having sex that is less safe from the risks you are really worried about (ie, pregnancy.) and it sounds like you are getting some solid advice from your mom, and that you are comfortable going to a doctor to get more concrete medical advice.

**I think that you really need to take a step back and assess your relationship with your girlfriend.** You mention that she doesn't want to get on BC, and she's given several reasons- she's afraid of doctors, she's afraid of weight gain, and she's all but said that she's afraid of losing you (and that somehow being on BC will make it easier for you to leave her-- I must admit, I don't see the logic unless she's planning on having your kid without consulting you.) 

In short, she is making a bunch of decisions about her sexual activity out of fear.  **Fear is a bad reason to make any decision.** 

**OP, I really suggest you make some thoughtful internal assessments of your girlfriend's life right now. Does she plan for the future? Does she let emotional worries strongly effect her decisions? Does she cancel things in her life to do what you want? Do you ask her to do that, or does she just offer it and let you find out later? How does she talk about your relationship? Are you the only thing in her life that's awesome?**

Here's why I am asking these things (and you don't have to answer, but think about them for a bit privately.)  : Teenage pregnancies are often only sort of accidental. They often arise in situations where a person has very little economic opportunity, few positive plans for their future, and can't put off present pleasures for future ones because their future doesn't look that great.  Young women who have plans for their futures generally try to make sure that their plans won't fall apart- they put aside money, they look at colleges, they think about birth control. (People still make mistakes with birth control, especially if they don't have good information, so this isn't 100%) 

But there are lots of young women who get pregnant in their early life because they don't see a pregnancy as a huge disruption of a great adventure they were planning- they see it as a positive spot in an otherwise very boring and drab existence with no bright hopes ahead of them. Babies are nice and cute and fun and it's something to do when you don't expect anything else good in your life. It's something to do with your life that doesn't require you to plan ahead- it can just happen. And it ensures that this nice boyfriend will have to stick around and be part of your life. **Teenage pregnancies often happen in the lives of people who don't have a plan for themselves, and who therefore don't view having a child as a huge disruption of their future.**

You, OP, seem like you have some plans. I don't know what they are, but you have conclusively stated that a young child is not part of them. Your GF (based on the really really limited description you've given in your post and the comments) seems like she wants to **not** have a plan, and is willing to do things that you ask so that you will stick around and be her boyfriend. **Her plan is to have you stay.**  

Now, I don't have all the facts here (and I am just some schmuck on reddit), but if I am reading this right, and her plan is "Keep OP around," and you are in conflict over BC, it seems like she might be likely feel threatened that you will leave if she doesn't get on BC. (Which is a totally legit reason to break up, BTW). And so she might get on BC. But even if she GETS  on BC, it seems likely that she will still have *you* as her plan. Which means that she will still likely to do something stupid to keep you around, because you are her future and people do stupid things to protect their futures. (Again! I am schmuck on the internet. I could be wrong!)  I don't know what that thing might look like- pregnancy seems like it might be one particular fear for you, and that would likely be the worst one, but there are also just other issues here. Maybe she'll get an ill-advised tattoo? I don't know. 

I don't have a good conclusion for this. I just got a lot of heeby-jeebies from your post about your GF's anxieties and lack of desire to plan for her own awesome future.  I don't know if that rings true to you, but if  it does, please consider that you, OP, cannot be in charge of someone else's dream. You are one human and you need to be responsible for your own future. I see you doing that in your desire to protect that future from an unwanted pregnancy. Your GF needs to be responsible for taking charge of planning her own future, and it seems to me like she's not doing that planning, and that's a big red flag to me. 

Tl; DR?- We need male birth control beyond condoms. Your GF's lack of interest in her own future seems like a warning sign. Unplanned pregnancies often arise in situations where there was simply no good reason to avoid an unplanned child, and so no plan was made to avoid it. Make plans, research BC, and consider your future with this GF carefully.  Also, I am some weirdo on the internet, I could be totally off base, and I apologize for going waaaay off topic if I am. 
 This is the best response I think I've had and aptly describes not only the situation, but also thoughts I've had since posting. Thank you, this is really food for thought. I've literally just told her I'm more than considering ending things, mainly due to issues highlighted as a result of this argument, but also because she's too clingy and is seeming increasingly immature and does whatever I want to do without offering an opinion of her own on anything. Thanks again. Well, that's your call, and I'm glad I could help you get there.

Man, I kind of feel bad for her (not that this should alter your plans, it's your call). I had a roommate once who got dumped and all she could say was, "But I was doing everything *right*!" Because that's how she saw things- there were right and wrong ways to do things because there were things that her guy liked or did not, and she was very carefully attending to those things. Because keeping the guy mattered more than if she was happy and if they were doing things that were interesting to her.

So, yeah. She's young- she's got time. Well, that's your call, and I'm glad I could help you get there.

  Time to go, dude. The thing is, even aside from the clinging and the "maybe I just want to have an oops baby so you don't leave me" craziness, if you are not BOTH mature enough to have safe sex you are not mature enough to be in this sexual relationship. Wel, I think using condoms is generally still "safe sex," as long as you're using them properly and using them every time. If they were more consistent with the condom usage, it would still be very safe, though I definitely think using multiple BC methods is generally a good idea.

The thing is, even aside from the clinging and the "maybe I just want to have an oops baby so you don't leave me" craziness, if you are not BOTH mature enough to have safe sex you are not mature enough to be in this sexual relationship.  Your situation sound exactly like my brother. He's just turned 19 yesterday and he and his girlfriend now have a 1.5 year old baby because she didn't want to use BC either and didn't like how condoms felt. 

I can't begin to cover the rifts it's tearing in our family. Because they were both still in HS and living at home, her mom has commandeered the situation. I've seen my nephew exactly 4 times since his birth, including one time in the hospital. He's walking now and I've never even seen it. My mom has seen him about the same or less.. her own grandchild. Her family blames him and considers him less than a man or a father but a sperm donor. He's only allowed to see her and the baby once a week now. Anyway, not to go off about my own life, but please think about your families as well as your own futures. A little sex is not worth having a baby right now. You aren't ready, she isn't, and your families certainly arent ready to be raising your child.. which trust me, they would be doing a lot of.

My suggestion is to be as supportive as possible and do anything you can to make her feel more comfortable about at least SEEING the doctor. No pressure, she does not need to get BC the first visit, but just go. Take the fear out of the situation. Research clinics with her, discuss whether a male or female would be less intimidating and then gooooo. Talk with a doctor. Hear your options and risks from a medical professional. Go with her if it makes her feel more secure. But if she is unwilling then you HAVE TO REMAIN FIRM. No sex without BC! Condoms are not enough. The sad fact is, if she is not willing to help control pregnancy to the best of her ability your best option may be to move on. Better now than getting stuck with a baby and responsibility you aren't ready for. Thanks for sharing your experience, I'm beginning to think the only option left open to me is to either abstain from sex or move on. I want sex, but I don't want to move on just because of a lack of sex, it seems like a really jerk-ass thing to do. It's not the lack of sex you're moving on from, it's that your relationship isn't healthy because you can't discuss these things and come to some sort of compromise.

Edit: I realize about an hour later this is a super heteronormative statement, 'birth control' only being applicable to hetero sex, after all.  More generally: Don't have sex with anyone anti-protection.  And as long as the protections you're using aren't incompatible, the more the merrier. I'm always kind of shocked when this NEEDS to be stated; I guess I always thought it was kind of a no-brainer. To be fair, there's the exception of 'long-term, committed relationship in which kids have been planned for', but yeah, should be obvious.  I suppose there's also the factor of terrible sex education... Don't have sex with anyone anti-birth control, as a rule.

I was irritated at your post at first because of the "birth control" label, but then read your change to "anti-protection" and was not as irritated anymore.  Just know that not everyone avoids birth control (hormonal) because they are "anti-birth control" - I've been on several forms and NONE have worked for me.  I get acne, weight gain, mood swings, loss of libido, and other decidedly unpleasant side effects.  After the last failure (Nuva ring), I decided I was NEVER subjecting my body to hormonal treatment like that again.  It took almost three years to get back to a normal cycle and normal libido.  I would consider other methods (IUD, for instance), but never again something that relies on hormones.  And it is not up for discussion - he uses condoms and that's that.  Not because I am a bitch, but because the side effects do not make the protection worth the grief. Thanks for the input and your background, I appreciate it.  Speaking specifically about birth control, those hormonal failures are exactly why I'm so keen on getting [RISUG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance) and other male contraceptives into widespread use - the more viable options there are, the better the chances for individuals and couples to make the choices that work for them.

I commented because I initially felt like the person in OP's post was universally against birth control measures, rather than the failures of specific methods.  When I went to edit to adjust for my misread, I realized I was missing more than just the OP's story but leaving out a lot of people as well.

I would consider other methods (IUD, for instance), but never again something that relies on hormones.  And it is not up for discussion - he uses condoms and that's that.  Not because I am a bitch, but because the side effects do not make the protection worth the grief.  Just an aside: if she were to open up to some form of birth control, would you trust that she would reliably use it? Unfortunately most options are centred around the woman and her desire to use the birth control properly to ensure she herself doesn't become pregnant.  I know she wouldn't remember to take the pill, but she's worried about weight gain with that anyway so that's a no go. An implant would probably be the best option but how open to that she'd be is unknown to me. I know she wouldn't remember to take the pill, but she's worried about weight gain with that anyway so that's a no go. An implant would probably be the best option but how open to that she'd be is unknown to me. Her excuse it weight gain?  She does know what accidental pregnancy will do to her body, right? Not that it's necessarily permanent, but it very well could be.  Either way, weight gain is pretty well guaranteed with pregnancy itself, whereas it's not guaranteed at all with hormonal birth control. Any weight gain experienced would be from water rentention anyway.. Her excuse it weight gain?  She does know what accidental pregnancy will do to her body, right?

An implant would probably be the best option but how open to that she'd be is unknown to me. Do they offer the Birth Control shot in the UK? I've heard it's not as drastic as the implant, but you only need it once every 3 months. 

Also, if she's so worried about weight gain that she'll refuse to take the pill, you might want to show her a quick google search on what getting pregnant does to most women's bodies. She can probably handle an extra 5-10 lbs from the pill much better than the stretch marks, cellulite, and other effects from pregnancy, if she's that concerned about her body.  Also, not *every* woman gains any significant weight from every type of BC. I know she wouldn't remember to take the pill, but she's worried about weight gain with that anyway so that's a no go. An implant would probably be the best option but how open to that she'd be is unknown to me.    You can't force someone to go to the doctor.  You can't force someone to take medication.  You've expressed yourself and your girlfriend has expressed herself.  Stop having sex or break up and find someone who is on the same page.  I see nothing wrong with her not wanting to go to doctor/go on the Pill because hormonal bc isn't right for everyone; I also see nothing wrong with you asking her to participate in birth control.  I think you are at an impasse here. I suggest you break up because I doubt you can both really stop yourselves from having sex. You are teens and one thing leads to another, especially if you've been doing it. If it was a religious awakening or something, sure, I can see being celibate. But that's not the case here.  You're at a crossroads and neither of you is going to "win." i agree with just about all you've said. i feel like while what everyone else is saying is VALID and sensible, they're ignoring one thing that really bothers me: 

these two haven't even been together a year.  
if my boyfriend had started bothering me about HBC less than a year in,  i'd tell him to fuck off too. if he's not comfortable with the situation he can 1: stop having sex with her or 2: leave her.   Is there a school nurse that she trusts? Sometimes they can give some information about birth control or referrals to a good ob/gyn in the area. Unfortunately no, I left the college she attends last year and know for a fact that there's no real 'nurse' there, this is the UK so I don't think the school nurse thing is a necessity over here, but I can't be sure. 

I appreciate the reply though and will upvote as it is probably a good idea to see if she has anyone she can talk to about it that has some experience in the area. I know her mum got pregnant very early and has done nothing to put her on birth control so she is probably not the person to go to, but I genuinely cannot think of anyone else. What? Every school in the UK has a member of staff specifically for health (including sexual health) advice and some minor treatment (e.g. over-the-counter painkillers). In fact there's a big debate in the UK about whether or not the school can give a teenaged girl the contraceptive pill without her parent's knowledge. I have no idea where you got the idea that there's no-one at her school or college who she can go to.  It seems my college don't make a huge deal of this then, she's never been in contact with any nurse from the college so I assume this would be just as bad as her going to the doctors. Thank you for highlighting this for me though, I'll suggest it just incase it is easier for her like that.

Go to an NHS family planning clinic! They're great, I went when I was 15.  Honestly if I was you I would just talk tell her. "I understand you're scared and I know it's your body and its intimately your choice. Though you also have to understand it's OUR future it effects. And you're being rather selfish making a choice that could change OUR lives without even being willing to look into it. It's ultimately your choice and I will respect your choice however I do find it incredible one sided of you that you won't even look into this with me. And it makes me worry about our future. If you can't even freely explore my side of the issue on this topic how am I suppose to think that we can talk freely on other important topics?" Or something to that effect. Yes it is very true that it is indeed her body and he has a right to do why she wants with it. But it's also your life and you have every right to protect it. If she dosesn't take that well then I think she too immature to have sex. It's totally one thing to after being educated making the choice not to use them. But she's pretty much sticking her fingers in her era and refuses to listen which is very childish.  Thank you very much, this was really helpful and I've just tried putting it across this way with a bit of paraphrasing, I want to respect her body but I don't want to risk both our futures by accidently creating a baby, I love her but I'm under no qualms about young love, chances are it won't last forever and I don't want to bring a child into the world where things aren't certain Good man! I'm glad someone in your relationship seems mature enough to think about this. Just remember what you're doing right now you should NOT waiver on. She's being immature and that type of immaturety leads to another baby in the world an another 2 people have to turn their lives upside down over one night of fun. One night is not worth 18 years. And is she can't understand all these worries maybe its best to stop having sex until she does.

But she's pretty much sticking her fingers in her era and refuses to listen which is very childish.      If she's afraid of the MD, telling her about the need for BC is going to go 'whoosh' right over her head. She doesn't CARE about the risks, because she's afraid of the MD. 

So, and I might get downvoted for this and if so, so be it, temporarily put the BC issue on hold. Talk to her ONLY about your *concern* that she is afraid of the MD, and this goes far and away above BC. If she can't get help when she needs it, this will impact her in many more broad ways. And, seriously, it will. A basic gyn exam every year or 2 is a good thing when you are an adult; she's sexually active by choice, then she counts. 

What is she afraid of? Does she see her usual PCP? Is she afraid of her parents finding out? Is she uncomfy w/ a male MD? Is she uncomfy w/ the idea of someone staring at her lady bits w/ her feet in the air? Is she afraid the exam will hurt? If she doesn't go the MD for even yearly checkups, you have a much much longer road to get her on BC than if she just prefers a female MD. Help her problem solve. 

... And in the meantime there are LOTS of other fun things you can do ;)   Could you guys use condoms plus a spermicide? She wouldn't have to go to the doctor for that.        If you use condoms correctly every single time, they can be a reliable contraceptive. I wouldn't take the angle of "risks of sex with only condoms", because that's not the issue here. The issue here is inconsistent and incorrect condom usage. 

I think it's absolutely reasonable to encourage your girlfriend to see a doctor, especially since she is sexually active and should be seeing a gynecologist. It's not just about birth control, but also about her sexual health. That said, you cannot force her to go on birth control. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to avoid hormonal contraception, but it sounds like this is more of an issue with doctors than anything else. 

I do understand her perspective though. I also prefer to avoid doctors and I also refuse to use hormonal contraception, but I do regularly see a gynecologist for all of my necessary screenings/tests. 

Edit: Apparently I can't read English so well, I thought the gf had no idea OP was discussing sex/contraception with his mother.
~~On a separate note, I'm not sure it's appropriate to be discussing your sex life with your mother, particularly since it sounds like your girlfriend isn't aware of that fact. I know I would be absolutely furious if I found out my boyfriend was discussing our contraceptive use to his mother, regardless of her intentions.~~



 I agree with you, up until the last point. I personally think it's good if teenagers (particularly those who've not had sex before) can discuss it with their parents. Parents can be very helpful resources when it comes to learning about contraception, STDs, etc. There's also nothing that straight up said or even implied (to me, at least) that the girlfriend doesn't know the mother knows. I took it as the girlfriend doesn't know the mother is upset... This is correct, she knows I talk to my mother about things like this, and my mum is very good at knowing about it, she's been there herself and works very closely with doctors on a regular basis and any knowledge I get from her usually stems from a doctor. So far her advice when it comes to safe sex has been really helpful, and I'm glad of the open relationship I have with her and don't try and hide this from my girlfriend, however I'm hiding how upset my mum is with her because I know she'd only feel pressured and it would make things worse considering she's feeling pressured by me at the moment as it is. To your post, I think you need to make clear to your girlfriend how much stress her behavior is causing you. You said it yourself; you're both having the sex, you both get to have opinions and make decisions on when/how/if contraception is used. It sounds like she effectively does not want birth control, and you do. It's the sort of thing where sex should be put on hold until a decision is reached and both parties are happy.

That said, her comment about you wanting her on BC so you could leave... Raises some red flags. I do worry (based just on the information given here) that she may try to get pregnant in an attempt to "keep you". Yes, it happens, and I know girls who've done it.

The two of you should stop having sex (for the time being), sit down, and discuss the birth control, her insecurities, and the possibility that she wants to get pregnant. If she won't have a calm, rational, adult conversation about this, she shouldn't be having sex, IMHO. That's exactly what I'm worried about, as soon as she's pregnant there's nothing I can do and I'm then trapped. I love her and want to be with her but that definitely raised a few questions. I think I need to sit down and talk through it with her, but she has a tendency to close down about anything that makes her emotional so I'm not entirely sure how much it would help.

 I know they can be 'reliable', but I know that reliable is not as reliable as it could be when doubled up with the pill or an IUD or other measures. I really only want her to see the doctor to make her more aware of how dangerous we've been, she seems to think it's completely fine to only occasionally use condoms, and I have to physically stop her so I can put one on sometimes, which isn't how it should be. 

I think her view of sexual health is that if it isn't broke don't fix it, her parents haven't made any attempt to take her to the doctors now that they are aware we are sexually active, so I think that that's more from her family. I don't think it's very likely she'd go see a gyno either if she can't handle a visit to her local GP (which she went to 3 days ago with a water infection and I don't understand why she couldn't have done it then). 

I know she's not comfortable with doctors, I get that, but I don't see a way around it to change her nonchalant view of sexual health.

In reference to the last part, she's aware of how open I am with my mother, and she's open with hers to an extent also, I've never picked up on it being a problem before but it's definitely something I'll keep in mind throughout! 

Thanks for the reply, it's nice to see a perspective similar to what I think hers is. She has every right to her own body, true, but remember that you have every right to not have sex that you consider to be too risky. And if you're using the withdrawal method, I'd say that's too risky with typical use. 

There are methods you can use that aren't hormonal, but unfortunately for you, they're all methods that she has to see a doctor for, like getting fitted with a diaphragm or getting a non-hormonal IUD. And if she is unwilling to see a doctor and take control of her reproductive capabilities, then you have every reason to be unwilling to have sex with her. Not as a mechanism of controlling her behavior, but you *have* to protect yourself first, and if you aren't comfortable with just condoms, don't have sex with just condoms!

"If it ain't broke don't fix it" works well with some things, but by the time you find out your contraceptives aren't working for you, it's too late. It's like finding a gas leak after your house blows up. Don't wait. Do something, even if it's just not having sex right now. This is exactly how I feel, I can't get this point across though without it sounding like I'm holding back sex so that she gets on some contraception.

Thanks for the reply, it's nice to see a perspective similar to what I think hers is. It sounds like it isn't just sexual health, but rather doctors in general. I totally understand that, because I'm the same way, but it's a serious issue. Avoiding doctors can have serious health consequences and I'd be concerned that she doesn't see that. My boyfriend recently forced me to go to the hospital after being sick for weeks and I discovered that I had a serious autoimmune condition that I had been neglecting for years. 

What does she say when you try to talk to her about going to the doctor? Any doctor? Is she willing to discuss with you or does she just shut down? I would consider as a first step printing some internet resources and offer to review/discuss them together. Does she have any friends or trusted adults to talk to? A sexual health hotline? 

Personally, I would be concerned if my partner was unwilling to discuss consistent contraceptive use. I'd call that a pretty big red flag and possibly a deal-breaker. I think open communication, particularly with regards to sex, is absolutely essential. 

 She first of all said I wasn't listening when she said she was afraid of the doctors, then I asked what I could do to help her, I'd already said I would go with her and do all the talking if that helped. I'm not entirely sure this is the issue though, as she went to the doctors by herself on friday because she had a water infection, which again makes me think she has a 'if it ain't broke don't fix it attitude', but as highlighted by /r/lil_Boots1, it's too late by the time it's broken.                  While you should be fine if you use condoms correctly every time you have sex (and don't store them in your wallet, don't used oil based lube with latex condoms, etc), it's always a good idea to double up on protection or use something that's a bit more reliable. I wouldn't be worried about getting pregnant if you're using condoms the right way and you're using them every single time you have sex...however, if you're using them inconsistently and/or incorrectly, then that's the issue.  
  
I think encouraging your girlfriend to see a doctor is a great thing to do. Some women are very hesitant about birth control because it involves hormones and there's potential for some unpleasant side effects with many of them...however, with your girlfriend it sounds like she just doesn't want to deal with the doctors. Make it clear to her that while you respect the choices she makes for her body, she has to understand that this doesn't only affect her, it affects you as well. Has she ever researched birth control options herself or has she just completely written it off? Because there are birth control pills that only have one type of hormone in them (Progestogen-only pills), and like you said, there are IUDs with low amounts of hormones or no hormones at all. I would definitely suggest talking to her about it again and telling her that this affects you as well.  
  
&amp;gt; She countered with saying that the only reason I want her on birth control is so that I can leave freely when I want to, I know she has a tendency to be clingy sometimes but that genuinely frightened me because I'm in no way ready to even contemplate a child yet.  
  
Okay, that doesn't even make sense....the point of birth control is to prevent pregnancy. I'm assuming she's talking about if she gets pregnant, you'd be able to leave freely? This part is a warning sign. That doesn't even make sense.              Am I the only one who thinks this is unreasonable? As a 31-year-old woman, I have never taken hormonal BC and never will. If a SO suggested it to me, I'd politely explain why I don't. Sorry, but it's not worth it to put extra hormones in my body that might have bad consequences down the line. 
How would you feel if she was pressuring you into getting a vasectomy? And talking to her father about it?

That being said, don't have PIV sex with her if you're concerned about pregnancy. Also, don't ignore the red flags. If you eventually get her to agree to go on BC, chances are she might not take it as directed.  Am I the only one who thinks this is unreasonable?

If you eventually get her to agree to go on BC, chances are she might not take it as directed.  This is the sort of response I actually want, I want to get into her mindset and at least try and understand what's going through her head. She hasn't really explained at all why she doesn't other than the risk of gaining weight, which to her is a big deal as she has insecurities about weight, but really I don't find that a suitable reason considering the implications of a pregnancy. I've said I'm aware of other methods of contraceptives, do you use any others yourself or purely condoms? have you ever had an issue? 

I don't think vasectomy is quite the same as the implant, pill or similar methods, I may be wrong here as I'll admit I have little life experience but the vasectomy appears to have a much higher risk margin than the implant would, and it could leave me infertile permanently, which is something I don't think I could live with properly, I've always wanted kids of my own, just not yet!

I don't plan on PIV with her until I'm sure measures are being taken to be safer, I don't even want her to go on contraception straight away, I understand it's a big step, for now I just want her to go to the doctors and talk about it to ease her into a proper discussion about the possibilites.

First time giving or receiving oral, first time being fingered, first time for PIV. I don't even remember his name, but you know what? I feel great. I had fun. He was caring and gentle. Everything went smoothly.

Some of my friends, who know my regular account name, are less than thrilled. They think this is something I should regret. I think they just forget what it's like to be single and to want to have a little fun. I just wanted to share this with a community of women who is more welcoming to my excitement! Thank you ladies for being awesome and so accepting of other people's lifestyles!  Congratulations and I am so glad you had fun!!!

Though I'm not sure what your circumstances were, I would in general advocate knowing someone's first and last name before you go home with them/take them home with you, just to have on record.  And not only in sexual situations, either... it's just a good idea to know whose house you are crashing in, or vice versa. Oh yeah, I would totally agree. He was a friend of my friends so they knew where I was and who I was with. There was just alcohol involved, and when I woke up in the morning, I realized I couldn't remember his name! Woopsies. I have recently learned that his name was Kevin. So...nice work last night, Kevin. haha Yeah, you mentioned it was a friend of a friend so hopefully your friend was able to vouch for him and knew where you were in case of an emergency.  

Yay Kevin :-) Unfortunately it is impossible to vouch for somebody. There is always a risk in life that someone can hurt you, even if you know them very well. In fact, the people you know well are better able to hurt you then strangers. Congratulations and I am so glad you had fun!!!

Yeah I'm not sure if that's what OP's friends don't approve of but if it were one of my friends, but not knowing the name of the person you're fucking just sounds slightly irresponsible. It's not necessarily that knowing the person's name is even all that important, it just indicates or suggests a more general recklessness, like other precautions weren't taken.  his name, his sexual history? i dunno one night stands just kind of squick me out, just because you DON'T know anything about the guy. i personally couldn't do it. it's great that he wasn't a jerk about it, but still. knowing someone's name is kind of...you know. basic stuff.  I disagree, I find it fun and exciting. I disagree, I find it fun and exciting. I disagree, I find it fun and exciting. [deleted] OP never said it was unprotected.

It's not necessarily that knowing the person's name is even all that important, it just indicates or suggests a more general recklessness, like other precautions weren't taken.   You're 23, why the fuck should you regret having a good time??  Everyone an adult? check, everyone consenting? check, nobody hurt? check.  W T F is their problem?  You're 23, why the fuck should you regret having a good time??  Everyone an adult? check, everyone consenting? check, nobody hurt? check.  W T F is their problem?  I know that's probably a rhetorical question, but I thought maybe you'd like to hear the other side of things.

Sex is just about the most intimate you can be with someone else, at least physically. I also think there's an association between physical intimacy and emotional intimacy. It's definitely possible to have one without the other, but there are similarities between them. They are both types of personal intimacy. They are how "close" you can get to someone else.

With the emotional kind, it usually takes a while to develop. Most people have this intimacy with their family, whom they've been with for literally as long as they've been alive. Some people have built emotional intimacy with a few close friends over the years. And some really lucky people have completely unfettered emotional intimacy with one significant other with whom they share the majority of their lives.

With emotional intimacy you (most likely) wouldn't find a random person in a bar, take them home, pour your heart out all at once sharing all of your fears and aspirations, all of your insecurities and hopes and then send them packing in the morning to never talk to them again. It might feel really good to get everything off of your chest, especially if this person's nice and a good listener. And you may even take comfort in the fact that you'll never see them again. You could tell them anything, all your darkest secrets, and even if they reacted poorly you'd never run into them again, so it wouldn't really matter.

But how healthy is that really? How safe are you telling strangers about your shadows? And wouldn't it be so much better if, instead of leaving the next day, that person was always around to do that for you? To always be there for you, emotionally intimate?

I think it's not only similar with sexual intimacy, I actually think it's the exact same situation.

I also feel that being overly generous with your intimacy - emotional, sexual, or otherwise - works to devalue any deeper intimacy you try to have. If someone opens up to you looking for reassurance, it's amazing and wonderful that they came to *you* for help. But if they do that with everyone they run into it's not longer meaningful. You're just another person they ran to for help, there's no personal or special connection. Along the same line, if this person has inconsequential sex with anyone they want, what makes it meaningful that they're having sex with you? I guess I just think there's a little more to sex than having fun, a lot more actually.

I wouldn't judge or think less of anyone deciding to have that type of sex, but I know it's definitely not for me. However, I'd also try to avoid those people. I wouldn't dream of telling people how to act, but I also can't ignore how what they're doing makes me feel.

I'm not the greatest at explaining myself, but I hope my views are at least a little understandable. I'd also love to hear good arguments against them (no, really, I would), because I definitely hear a lot opinions similar to yours, bannana. Everyone seems to justify them by saying, "it's not your business" or "as long as everyone consents, it's fine". It's possibly I just don't understand their point, but they just keep repeating those things like they're golden laws. It's frustrating to have a seemingly dissenting opinion and I just want to understand where everyone else is coming from. It seems like you just have a different view of intimacy, which is totally fine because *everybody* has a different view of intimacy. Personally, I don't think that emotional intimacy has to go hand-in-hand with being sexual with someone. I've had plenty of sex with people that I wouldn't want as a boyfriend, or even as a friend. Having sex with someone is just enjoying your body and another person's body. I feel much more comfortable doing that than talking about "all my darkest secrets". I would never consider my naked body and what I choose to do with it a "dark secret", so that's maybe why I'm comfortable having sex with people I'll never see again. I guess, to me sex isn't super intimate at all - my friends and I have sexual conversations all the time, so it's not like sex is a secret.


As for the "if you give it to everyone it isn't special anymore" business, I just plain don't agree. You could say the same thing about anything - are your hugs less valuable because you'll just *give* them away? Should you reserve your hugs for "someone special" that you have an intimate connection with? Or should you hug who you feel like, when you feel like it, and everyone's happy? I prefer to think that there isn't a finite amount of love around - the love I give someone doesn't take away from the love I have for someone else. There's more love where that came from!

This is not true for everyone. Some people just don't see sex as THE MOST intimate act you can engage another person in. It is not an emotional investment for everyone. Not everyone demands an emotional commitment either from the person they have sex with. Not everyone needs it to be meaningful. You're entitled to these opinions, of course. Just don't judge OP for not sharing your personal values, and don't assume your needs are everyone's needs. Please don't think I'm telling you off or taking you down a peg just because you hold yourself and the people you sleep with to a higher standard. Its just that some people don't care as much as you do and that isn't a bad thing. You're not doomed to have a shitty life if you have a cavalier attitude about sex. Nor are you guaranteed to be happy and satisfied for holding emotional and physical intimacy in such high esteem.

... also, I worry from your statements that you place a lot of value in sex and I'm concerned you will be disappointed or will chase off someone potentially awesome just because you didn't see eye to eye.  Can you think of another physical activity that's more intimate than sex? Someone else here said grooming one another can be more intimate. I don't quite agree, sex is still tops for me, but I can see where that's coming from and can understand how it might be. I have a friend who thinks that sharing a toothbrush with their SO is the grossest thing imaginable. But if you think about it logically, some of the sexual things you do to each other could be considered much more gross. (Note: I don't mean to say that sex is gross, just that you could take a step back and objectively view it that way.) Is sharing a toothbrush really more gross (or, for this convoluted analogy, more intimate) than sharing bodily fluids?

Another thing about inconsequential sex is that because you don't know the person you're with, you could be being intimate with a straight up terrible person. You'll never know if things are kept impersonal and you never see them again. But what about that other person, the sweet one that actually cares about you? How would they react if they found out? Yeah, it's none of their business. Yeah, it's fine if you have fun. You don't owe that person anything. But can't you see how that might be wrong? How it might affect other people negatively?

Also, I don't think emotional intimacy and physical intimacy need to be tied together. It sounds like that's what I was going for, but I only meant to compare the two types of intimacy in my first post. I just meant to say it's strange that most people treat one different than the other and to try to explain why someone might not approve of someone else's decisions on sexual intimacy.

&amp;gt; I worry from your statements that you place a lot of value in sex and I'm concerned you will be disappointed or will chase off someone potentially awesome just because you didn't see eye to eye.

I worry about similar things, but I think seeing eye to eye on sex is pretty important. It might be a good thing that the relationship ends if we can't agree on that issue. Grooming is an excellent example of something physically intimate two people can do that isn't sex. I would also consider sleeping in the same bed something to which I (personally) assign more intimate value than sex. I'm alert and mentally available during sex. I'm vulnerable and unaware of my surroundings while asleep, and therefore require much more trust to actually sleep with someone. 

&amp;gt; But can't you see how that might be wrong? How it might affect other people negatively?

So really this is just your personal rant about the moral turpitude of "inconsequential sex"? It's "wrong" for you, therefore wrong for the OP and the rest of woman-kind? 

I don't understand exactly what you're arguing for here and I'm afraid I'm interpreting you falsely. If the OP wanted "inconsequential sex" and really had no plans for physically and emotionally intimate sex, what is the problem? It sounds like she got what she wanted and did so safely.  &amp;gt; Sex is just about the most intimate you can be with someone else, at least physically.

I have done this and have had this done to me on more occasions than I've taken home strange.  There's something nice about being able to be that open and honest without worry about later judgments.  It's therapeutic. :) Yeah. I put that exception in parentheses just for you.

I've done this too, though. It is therapeutic, but it usually doesn't turn out well for me. I know that's probably a rhetorical question, but I thought maybe you'd like to hear the other side of things.

Sometimes I get the feeling that it's wrong to be a poster in 2X if you haven't slept with 20+ people. 

EVERYTHING in life loses its value/charm/etc when you do it repeatedly. That is a fact. Our brains just work (or don't work haha) that way. 

The more of something there is, the less it is worth. If everyone had 10 pairs of Jimmy Choo shoes, no one would find them to be special anymore.

And no, this isn't religious prude bullshit. I want nothing to do with religion. No ones ever referred to a lifetime of sleeping around as "precious". But you sure do hear that word used a lot with people who realize the value of the most intimate act 2 people can share. And the value is so incredibly high that I can't understand why people would throw that away in exchange for hedonism and increased physical, etc. danger.  Real danger.  And how many of you that have slept with a lot of people have done almost all of it while sober?  

And I do want to apologize....I don't really know how to get across my point without it sounding like "easy" people are bad or gross. OK, fine, maybe it grosses me out, but I don't believe people should be treated like shit or shamed because they aren't very discriminating in who they take to bed. 

Its just like someone who eats the whole cake instead of a slice. There's nothing wrong with cake, but don't complain when you get diabetes.

I keep getting interrupted, so before I completely lose my train of thought, I'm gonna hit that there submit button.

Edit:  I am open to amending my worldview to fit facts when I am wrong.  So I encourage people to explain why they see nothing at all wrong with living like that.  I'd really like to understand it. I'm not sure I agree with the idea that scarcity = value. Do you also think that if you find that someone who you do want to have sex with, the more you have it, the less it is worth? Do you think that the more new people you meet, the value of those friendships (or your previous ones) goes down? Maybe that's not quite what you mean, if it isn't, correct me.

Confession here, I have never 'slept around', but I don't see a problem with it. I also don't see a problem if it's something you don't want to do. I do have a problem if people aren't careful, just because I worry. Of course sex has consequences, and people should take precautions just like with anything else (like wearing a seatbelt). 

Other people place less value on sex than you might. I think that might be why you have trouble understanding the view? I value sex highly as an intimate act myself, but I also believe there are more intimate acts. I don't know the best way to describe it, but just talking with someone, sharing the parts of you that you would usually never let someone else know about (baring your soul?) is something I would consider far more intimate and special. And I'm not asking everybody to think that same way, but it's something to consider when you think about it all. To your first paragraph? Actually, I do. Its why 2 married people can still be deeply in love with each other after 20 years but the spark is dead. Its not because they don't want intimacy or that they're grossed out by their spouse's appearance (though that can certainly be the case), it's because they've done it so many times in so many ways in so many places that there's nothing that hasn't been done (if they're doin it right, anyway. He he he). 

(I'm going to have to edit this cause my phone app covers your post when I try to reply and I don't remember if there was anything else to address.... )"brb".

Ah, yes, that not everyone values sex like we do.  Now I remember! 

Basically, I realize that humans occupy a spectrum of preferences and beliefs, and that just because my way is right it doesn't mean someone else's different way is wrong.  Like, I'm grossed out by the idea of swapping fluids with a stranger or someone I barely know.  I can't say for a fact I'd never do it ever ever ever, but I do know that I would regret it if I did.   And I recognize that part of that is just plain what i see as being smart about things, but I also recognize that my boundaries extend further than other people's when it comes to strangers both physically and emotionally.  I'm more toward one end of a healthy spectrum and someone who's slept with both lovers and strangers is toward the other end of that spectrum.  I don't really get that mindset, but I don't have to.  I just shrug and think about how weird humans are in general.  But people like the OP?  That crosses the line from "*shrug*, I don't get it, bit whatever" over to "that person's kinda fucked up".  It is outside the bounds of what is considered more or less well-adjusted behavior.  

 To your first paragraph? Actually, I do. Its why 2 married people can still be deeply in love with each other after 20 years but the spark is dead. Its not because they don't want intimacy or that they're grossed out by their spouse's appearance (though that can certainly be the case), it's because they've done it so many times in so many ways in so many places that there's nothing that hasn't been done (if they're doin it right, anyway. He he he). 

(I'm going to have to edit this cause my phone app covers your post when I try to reply and I don't remember if there was anything else to address.... )"brb".

Ah, yes, that not everyone values sex like we do.  Now I remember! 

Basically, I realize that humans occupy a spectrum of preferences and beliefs, and that just because my way is right it doesn't mean someone else's different way is wrong.  Like, I'm grossed out by the idea of swapping fluids with a stranger or someone I barely know.  I can't say for a fact I'd never do it ever ever ever, but I do know that I would regret it if I did.

 I know that's probably a rhetorical question, but I thought maybe you'd like to hear the other side of things.

Sex is just about the most intimate you can be with someone else, at least physically. I also think there's an association between physical intimacy and emotional intimacy. It's definitely possible to have one without the other, but there are similarities between them. They are both types of personal intimacy. They are how "close" you can get to someone else.

With the emotional kind, it usually takes a while to develop. Most people have this intimacy with their family, whom they've been with for literally as long as they've been alive. Some people have built emotional intimacy with a few close friends over the years. And some really lucky people have completely unfettered emotional intimacy with one significant other with whom they share the majority of their lives.

With emotional intimacy you (most likely) wouldn't find a random person in a bar, take them home, pour your heart out all at once sharing all of your fears and aspirations, all of your insecurities and hopes and then send them packing in the morning to never talk to them again. It might feel really good to get everything off of your chest, especially if this person's nice and a good listener. And you may even take comfort in the fact that you'll never see them again. You could tell them anything, all your darkest secrets, and even if they reacted poorly you'd never run into them again, so it wouldn't really matter.

But how healthy is that really? How safe are you telling strangers about your shadows? And wouldn't it be so much better if, instead of leaving the next day, that person was always around to do that for you? To always be there for you, emotionally intimate?

I think it's not only similar with sexual intimacy, I actually think it's the exact same situation.

I also feel that being overly generous with your intimacy - emotional, sexual, or otherwise - works to devalue any deeper intimacy you try to have. If someone opens up to you looking for reassurance, it's amazing and wonderful that they came to *you* for help. But if they do that with everyone they run into it's not longer meaningful. You're just another person they ran to for help, there's no personal or special connection. Along the same line, if this person has inconsequential sex with anyone they want, what makes it meaningful that they're having sex with you? I guess I just think there's a little more to sex than having fun, a lot more actually.

I wouldn't judge or think less of anyone deciding to have that type of sex, but I know it's definitely not for me. However, I'd also try to avoid those people. I wouldn't dream of telling people how to act, but I also can't ignore how what they're doing makes me feel.

I'm not the greatest at explaining myself, but I hope my views are at least a little understandable. I'd also love to hear good arguments against them (no, really, I would), because I definitely hear a lot opinions similar to yours, bannana. Everyone seems to justify them by saying, "it's not your business" or "as long as everyone consents, it's fine". It's possibly I just don't understand their point, but they just keep repeating those things like they're golden laws. It's frustrating to have a seemingly dissenting opinion and I just want to understand where everyone else is coming from.   I think it's awesome that you are excited/proud of this. As long as you used protection, good for you! It relieves some of the pressure of "being a virgin," and you can go out, have fun, and do what you like. It's great that you were able to enjoy yourself, and still feel the same way after it's over. It shows a lot of maturity that you are confident in your choices. Congratulations!  This is how I did it, too. No strings attached, totally casual, met him that night. It was awesome. He was hot. He made me feel sexy. It's still the best sex I've had.   you go girl! having sexual freedom is not something to regret! our ladies back in the 60's fought hard for you to have that kind of fun without being judged! so you're friends can stick their noses up in somebody else's air, because you don't give no fucks.  What's PIV?      Glad you had a great night! And I just have to say this... because it is awfully, awfully true.... If you were male, your actions would be overly celebrated and encouraged. So, I think your friends can shove it, and you can do what you want as long as you are not uncomfortable or regretful of your decisions. Just because reckless sexual behavior would be overly celebrated by males doesn't mean that it should then automatically be embraced when a woman does it. It could still be potentially reckless/dangerous behavior. This isn't exactly the place to be fighting for female equality.

As long is she is fully informed and fully consenting, it is her business and hers alone.

 &amp;gt; This isn't exactly the place to be fighting for female equality.

There is no place not to fight for female equality. &amp;gt;There is no place not to fight for female equality.

I'm not saying that women shouldn't be thought of as equals for any sort of reason, I'm saying that it's fucking stupid to make this into some kind of feminist issue. You really want to fight for equality so that women are high-fiving like bros for totally banging that dude at the gas station? Nobody should be high-fiving anyone for banging anyone else at the gas station so I wouldn't say this issue is a bastion for feminism. HELL YEAH IT IS sex is amazing and I dare you or anyone to slut shame me. I've fucked over 2 dozen people and it was a great time and I don't remember some of their names. I don't regret it ever and I am disease and pregnancy free. And I will high five you all after getting laid if that's my prerogative. I'm not tricking anyone into it, lying about my intensions, refusing contact afterward or being mean spirited in any manner. Good old consensual sex is high-five worthy, gas station, coffee shop, or the morning after with the person I brought home. High five partner, we did it! I really just want to call you a slut, just for the hell of it. Especially because I wasn't defending slut-shaming.

Casual sex is fine and fuck it, promiscuous sex is fine too, live your own life. I don't give a shit, really. My thing is just that the whole blas&#233; attitude that goes along with 'oh I didn't even know his name' just sounds fucking irresponsible. It's almost not even about actually knowing the dude's name or not, it's more about the mind-set that just makes it sound like, oh you're just asking for an STD. 

It also has nothing to do with any particular person or situation in this post, because I don't think I've really seen anyone admit to having unsafe/unprotected sex with a stranger. I never even assumed that OP *didn't* use protection. The thing that I really have an issue with is just the choice of words. There's something about people running around flaunting 'look at me and how much sex I have' in various ways that just irritates me.

edit: engaging in this argument at all is making me sound like an old, grouchy and conservative motherfucker when I'm really just one of the three. The OP is 23.  She has had sex *once*.  With a condom.  

As far as STI risk goes, she's pretty fucking far down the danger list. Yeah it's cool if you're not going to actually read what I wrote, but if not, why even bother replying? I really just want to call you a slut, just for the hell of it. Especially because I wasn't defending slut-shaming.

edit: engaging in this argument at all is making me sound like an old, grouchy and conservative motherfucker when I'm really just one of the three.     Ooh, congrats! I'm really happy for you. All my firsts have been sprawled out over the past two years, lol&#8212;not just stuff I've done with my boyfriend either, but getting drunk for the first time, getting drunk to the point of vomiting, making out with girls, taking the Pill, and using a vibrator, among other things.    Good for you. Sorry your friends kind of suck. Do what you want. (Not sure why so many people feel the need to post it on the Internet when they lose their virginity.)     Congratulations!

I'm rather envious, but very happy for you. Sounds like it was fun, and from what I've read in the comments, you were safe and smart about it. Who cares if you had a lapse of memory a la their name? I forget people's names after just meeting them sometimes, even sober!

Fist bump? :)  If you were happy, comfortable and safe, then all is well and AWESOME that you had a great night! :D  I will never ever understand this mindset. Lose several virginities in one night to a stranger? I cannot process how that could possibly be psychologically healthy. I mean, not too much is wrong with 1 night stands, but this? 

I understand why your friends say you will regret it. They're worried because this is aberrant behavior.

On the flip side, you used protection, so I can't knock you. You just make my brain hurt. 

You think that was fun, wait till you have sex with someone you actually give an actual shit about. That's when the truly mind blowing goodness begins.


I'm sure I'll be down voted to hell by the people that think fucking anyone at any time for any reason is a badge of honor instead of a right. You know what?  Not everyone wants or needs a relationship at all points in their lives.  Are you going to be judgmental on those who know better than to try to commit to a career and a partner and end up straining both or losing one?  Some folks just want to spend time with themselves and not worry about someone else's toothbrush.

Those folks shouldn't be denied the fine, squishy bits of life.

I say this as a excitedly-committed male getting married in 68 days who wants people to have options.  I know too many folks who got married *way* too early because they wanted to bone and couldn't conceive of dancing the extramarital, horizontal polka.  Amorous freedom is about the freedom to make career, relationship, and marriage decisions without the pressure of SEX motivating the decision.  If you want a career that would exclude a relationship, go for it.  Still want sex?  I'm not going to hold that against you. I agree!   Humans need sex and physical affection.  To expect someone to stay celibate when they're not in a relationship is, in a way, to deny them their humanity.  The thing that boggles my mind is that some people can go around with no restraint fucking a ton if people and not see why another person might question their well-being.

I don't have a problem with one night stands per se, but having all your first sexual experiences ever in one single night with a total stranger?  The creep out factor on that is substantial.  At least she wasn't a teenager I guess?    You don't even remember his name, but you feel perfectly fine with just going home with a random stranger? Okay.

I just want to know: Why do we encourage a woman to put herself in a dangerous situation like this? Going home ALONE with a stranger. Sure, nothing could happen. But there is no way of knowing, so why not use your brain and be fucking smart about it? Going home with a friend of a friend is very different than going home with a stranger.  Thank you. I think some people might be missing that part. Though I just met him last night, my friends were able to vouch for him. They just have issues with anything sexual. And the reason I couldn't remember his name was because alcohol was involved. I guess I didn't make that clear.

In short, he wasn't just some completely random stranger I randomly started chatting up then decided to go home with. Going home with a friend of a friend is very different than going home with a stranger.  Only a fraction of a difference. She doesn't even remember his name, so really, no difference. If it's a friend of a friend then someone knows where you are and can do something if they don't hear from you for a while and they can probably contact the person you are with if they can't contact you. If its a stranger no one knows where you are. There is a world of difference.  You don't even remember his name, but you feel perfectly fine with just going home with a random stranger? Okay.

I just want to know: Why do we encourage a woman to put herself in a dangerous situation like this? Going home ALONE with a stranger. Sure, nothing could happen. But there is no way of knowing, so why not use your brain and be fucking smart about it? Because people think feminism is all about encouraging women to do whatever they want, and not have any personal responsibility. If you tell a woman getting drunk and going home with a stranger is dangerous, you'll be accused of "slut shaming" or "victim blaming"  Thank you.

I know I posted my comment whilst very annoyed, and in a bad mood, and for that, I totally apologize.

It's just that topics like these get me so frustrated. I'm not going to praise or encourage someone to do things like this, not because I don't want them to "have fun!" or "express your sexual freedom!" but because I find it to be incredibly irresponsible, immature, and literally dangerous.

For many women out there, a night like this ends in rape, pure tragedy. It's not always a fun experience.  [deleted] Wow. Slut-shaming (def: making people feel bad for engaging in sexual behavior) is bad, and you should feel bad for doing it.  [deleted] [deleted] They deleted their comments, what did they say?

[BC4U](http://www.bc4u.org/)

The Children's Hospital in Denver apparently bleeds money or something--**they will do STD tests and give you birth control FOR FREE.**  Completely free.  And this applies to basically any kind of birth control.  For example, I got my IUD from them (which would normally be a few hundred dollars, and I've heard that sometimes doctors won't give them to women without children).  

You do have to be between 12 and 24 years old, but that's perfect if you're a teenager or a broke college student.  Everything is confidential and *as far as I know* **parental consent isn't needed.**  (I'm of age and that wasn't an issue for me, so don't quote me on that.)

I've been there twice now, and it was a great experience both times.  The staff is friendly and professional and very willing to talk about your options, concerns, whatever.  I know birth control can be a big issue for people who are sexually active at a [relatively] young age and it's not worth the risk of pregnancy when there's such a wonderful resource out there.    I had my Mirena placed there. The NP who did it was very nice and informative. You can also get the HPV vaccine for free there. Unfortunately, it's quite far away from me!  Commenting so I'll remember this when I visit home in two weeks.  </snippet></document><document><title>Something that I'm glad I asked about because I don't think it's common knowledge: Diva Cups and IUDs don't mix!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1983w0/something_that_im_glad_i_asked_about_because_i/</url><snippet>Today, I had an IUD inserted (YAY!) and I just happened to ask if having the IUD would affect being able to use a Diva Cup. I wouldn't have even thought to ask, except that I was looking over my Diva Cup booklet last night for the instructions on how to boil it and it said something about checking with your doctor if you have an IUD. Well, my NP said that I can't use the cup anymore because it works using suction, so it can suck the IUD right out. Crazy, amirite?! Apparently some chick that she knew did this the first period she got after having it inserted and it came out.

Anyway, sorry if this is old news, but I just thought that any of you considering the IUD might want to know. I'm pretty bummed that I have to go back to tampons, but I'm kinda okay with it because I'm so psyched that I won't have to worry about BC at all for the next 5-7 years! :-D  My gyn said it was fine as long as you didn't catch the strings in the cup and physically pull them out.  Full disclosure, I've done that before.  I asked when I got the IUD replaced, and my doctor said that I could keep using the two together as long as I was careful to not pull on the strings.  Been using the combo for over 2 years without problems since.  This isn't 100% true. When I had my copper IUD inserted my doctor said it was ok to use my Diva Cup with it, you just have to modify the way you remove it. You need to break the seal on your cervix by hooking a finger around the rim, then you can pull it out gently. It's a lot more messy, but I still prefer the cup over tampons.

I've been using the cup with the IUD for almost 3 years now and haven't had any problems. That makes sense. Thanks! I'll give it a shot. Although I'm not supposed to put anything in there until Friday, and by then my period will (hopefully) be over.  I should have added:

Take the advice of your doctor. I am some stranger on the internet, I didn't do your insertion, I don't have a medical degree. Your doctor might have had good reasons for making that recommendation.

I suggest bringing it up when you do your follow up with the doctor (they still do that right? to make sure the IUD is still in a good position?) Yeah, I'll be going back in a month so she can check it. I guess I'll bring it up then, but she seemed pretty adamant about not using the cup, so I doubt she'll say anything different.  That makes sense. Thanks! I'll give it a shot. Although I'm not supposed to put anything in there until Friday, and by then my period will (hopefully) be over.  This isn't 100% true.

I've been using the cup with the IUD for almost 3 years now and haven't had any problems.  I've never had any problems with my cup &amp;amp; IUD.  I've had my IUD for 5 years &amp;amp; my cup for 4 years.  My doctor never mentioned anything about the two being incompatible.  

IMO, the suction from the cup isn't nearly strong enough to displace the IUD.  I guess if it was partially out, then it might come all the way out.  Hell, I had an ex tug on the strings of my IUD &amp;amp; it didn't budge.  It fucking hurt, but didn't come out.  I had my gyno check to make sure it hadn't shifted too much with his tugging...

TLDR: I have a really hard time believing that a menstrual cup would create enough suction to pull it out.  Based on **PHYSICS** If it was already out, MAYBE it might seem like the 2 were connected...  Yeah, I hear ya. I had a hard time believing it myself, but I don't really want to risk it. I'll see if I can get another medical opinion on the subject before my next period rolls around. I understand the IUD being pulled out with the strings, but suction just isn't a sound explanation.  This is coming from someone with a background in physics!  

Really, the risk of tampons would be similar to an IUD as the strings might become caught in a tampon.  Did your doctor say anything about using tampons &amp;amp; the IUD together?

If you really want to use the 2 together, maybe hear the opinion of another doctor?     </snippet></document><document><title>As a woman at a university, I am acutely aware that this is not unique to a few schools.

   Just goes to prove that the university will try to cover it up because it hurts the university's bottom line to admit that its campus is dangerous for female students. 

If you're hurt on campus, go straight to the police. You can always file another complaint independently with the university afterward.    As a non-American I ask: What's a University Honor Court? Who sits on it? Does it have any real power? Is it part and parcel of the criminal courts?  I go to UNC so I have a bit of insight. The honor court doles out punishment at the University level. They see a lot of cases on cheating, and I'm pretty sure they deal with deciding what effect a criminal issue will have on your life at the university. They consists of students and I believe are overseen by administrators, all of which have some training, but not much.

That being said, rape cases are absolutely not something that should ever be dealt with by an honor court. It's an interesting situation, seeing as it's not technically a rape case that they're dealing with, at least as I understand it. The honour court is dealing with what is being perceived as harassment and "creating a hostile environment," which is well within its jurisdiction. What's interesting about it, though, is that it is making a statement about how the university feels about rape by referring even a part of the case to a group of students. &amp;gt; What's interesting about it, though, is that it is making a statement about how the university feels about rape by referring even a part of the case to a group of students.

I'm not sure I agree it is a negative reflection on the university. As a society (at least in the US) we have criminal trials where the jury is made up of a group of your peers. That is the same situation as sending something to a student panel. 

As someone who serves on the equivalent panel at a university in the same system, I think it is an appropriate way of dealing with the situation. We aren't just a random sampling of students pulled off campus to hear things like these, there is a lot that goes into even being considered to sit on such a panel. Fair enough. However, some of the questions that the court is asking strike me as incredibly poorly informed. Things like "Why didn't you break up with him" show that the court, while knowing how to deal with things like plagiarism cases, doesn't really know how to handle a case like this one. The UNC Honor Court no longer has jurisdiction over sexual assault/rape cases and they haven't for quite a while, IIRC. The UNC Honor Court no longer has jurisdiction over sexual assault/rape cases and they haven't for quite a while, IIRC. Which is a good thing. Well, it could possibly be bad, if it impairs the university's ability to expel or otherwise punish rapists and sexual assaulters.  However, even if removing powers from the student court results in this, I'd still be okay with it considering the power to expel people ought not to be in student hands anyway, regardless of the crime.

Do any UNC students here know of any groups on campus who are on top of this matter? I'd like to help out, however I can.  I didn't look further into it, but [this](http://www.simonedeboudoir.com/post/43970758419/signal-boost-girl-could-be-expelled-from-college) was linked on /r/WTF . They say that a girl could be expelled for creating a hostile environment for her rapist. What was written there is not what Jezebel's recent article says. That link says that "being raped" is an honor court violation, which is absolutely not what is being said at all. The (only slightly better) charge she's actually receiving is that by *talking copiously with the media and identifying her stalker/rapist's dorm* she is creating a hostile environment for him. Presumably many people on campus know who he is and I'm not saying that this is a legitimate charge (I'm not really opposed to public hostility towards known rapists), but she was specifically told to cease and desist from talking about this case and kept doing it so they charged her for not obeying the cease and desist notice, NOT for claiming she was raped and certainly not for *being* raped. From the Jezebel article: 

&amp;gt;Landen said that she attended a preliminary Honor Court meeting and asked whether she could have violated the Honor Code simply by saying she was raped; the answer was yes.

Even if she hadn't reported the dorm or given any identifying information, she would still have been charged. Yes, the legal issue is that she didn't obey the notice, but she could hardly create a hostile environment if she did nothing to identify him (which wasn't the case, but could have been). Yes, I read that and I'm not entirely sure I believe that as fact, given that it's coming from a publication that makes its living on being sensationalist. I'm open to the horrible fact that it may be true, but I'm not willing to pass judgement on the unbiasedness of that statement without hearing more than 1 very biased side. All the other information seems to be the save in every version I've heard, so it didn't seem less believable than every other part of the story. Are you sure those are independently reporting news sources? I've read multiple pieces on this as well and they all seem to directly quote the Jezebel article or use the same quotations from Landen, which makes it seem like it's not multiple pieces of unique journalism coming to the same conclusion, but rather a collection of publications rushing to publish the take on it based on the same, very limited, information.        Setting aside the issue of administrators trying to cover up/reduce charges of offenders, the last few paragraphs brought up a very interesting issue:

Bringing serious charges against a person *should be* very difficult, *especially* when the charges rely so heavily on a person's testimony. 

It's a pity that false accusations have made this such an issue, but any time you go to make legal accusations of any type, you and your motives *will be questioned*. I think it's not too much to ask that we recognize the difference between trying to sweep crimes under the rug and trying ascertain the truth through interrogation of witnesses. This isn't a legal accusation, though. It's the university honor court, not an actual court of law. He's not being accused of a crime, he's being accused of an 'honor code violation.' They aren't able to convict him or send him to jail- just expel, suspend, or maybe make him write a paper about how sorry he is.  A paper wouldn't be an appropriate sanction for a sexual assault case. Certainly not! That's just one of the range of actions/sanctions that the university can apparently take with honor code violations, according to one of the articles I read anyway. </snippet></document><document><title>Something my psychiatrist said to me is getting to me-- advise? (UPDATE)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198jhk/something_my_psychiatrist_said_to_me_is_getting/</url><snippet>[Original Post ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12l25y/something_my_psychiatrist_said_to_me_is_getting/)

OP TL;DR: I have really bad PTSD. Got a new psychiatrist assigned to me by my college. She didn't believe I didn't cheat on my SO/ didn't want to get pregnant/ wasn't going to kill myself and made me super uncomfortable. She also lied to me about my depression meds causing birth defects. 

**UPDATE BELOW**

So I ended up coming home, pretty much because I became too messed up to function. Went into complete depressive PTSD spiral. I was really nervous about getting a new psychologist (I'd had the same one since I went to college at 17) and extremely scared of a new psychiatrist. But I finally bucked up and found both- the psychiatrist only because I was about to run out of meds. My psychologist is sweet and motherly and comforting and I love her to death. But she's not who this is about.

My psychiatrist is honestly an angel. I was SO SCARED when I went in to see her- I knew I'd have to go over everything that had happened to me. She is a motherly woman, maybe late 40s, very fashionable and Spanish (which is unusual for my area- we mostly get South American Spanish-speakers, and very few from Spain). She sat down with me and had me explain everything to her. When I got choked up, she made me tea. She calmed me down, showed me pictures of her kitty and her kids, and when she realized how terrified I was of not being able to get my prescription (I can't drive because of vision issues, and I'd had a problem getting a pharmacy to work right before) she gave me samples to take home in addition to a two month prescription. I left feeling, for the first time in a long time, 100% optimistic about my life. I felt like there was someone truly on my side.

So, yea. I only really put this here because I don't know where else to go and my OP was here. And I figured, since my original story was so upsetting, I should update. So for all you amazing mental health professionals and doctors, I love you. All of you. And all of you people like me: there are great, trustworthy, super helpful ones out there. 

Now, on to find a gyno who doesn't give me panic attacks!

[rant]</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/196yfu/im_too_fat_for_my_clothes_rant/</url><snippet>This morning I woke up, excited for my first interview for an internship in a long time. I haven't worn my professional clothes in maybe a year (being a univ. student affords the luxury of dressing is jeans and a t-shirt everyday), but I figured I'd just grab a pair of slacks and a collared shirt. *Wrong.* Everything I tried on was tight and some of them didn't even button anymore. I knew I had gained some weight, but maybe I was in denial of just how much since I started college nearly three years ago. I panicked. I tried on every single piece that could be considered business attire and spiraled further into self-pity and frustration as each one continued to not fit. *I am too fat for my clothes.* My stomach spills over. My love-handles have muffined out. My shirts squeeze my boobs in too tight. My dresses struggle to fold over my hips. I sat in the corner of my closet and cried for much longer than I'm proud of. With my makeup redone, I sat and watched the rolls form from the fat encasing my stomach and wondered just when I had gotten so bad. I pulled on the least tight pair of slacks and a used-to-be-loose-and-flowy shirt that now hugs my body, and tried not to cry again. But my sanity and self-esteem have plummeted; I hate my fat body. I don't know what to do. I don't eat a ton and I try to exercise when I'm not too tired or busy. I can't afford a different wardrobe, and even then, buying bigger clothes would feel like defeat and I'm not sure I can handle that. I want to fix it. I have to fix it. And I know this mentality is not healthy - my education has taught me that and more. But it doesn't stop me from thinking it. *Knowing better* doesn't help me *feel better.*

Sorry for the rant, but I am losing it and needed to put this somewhere. 

EDIT: Thank you all those who offered encouraging words, advice, and even a motivational kick in the butt! It means so much that so many of you were willing to share your own experiences - its such a huge inspiration! It retrospect, I had a bit of a dramatic, blubbering meltdown this morning, but it has given me all the motivation I need to do something about it (without forgetting that I should accept my body for what it is, not what it isn't) And also, the interview went great! :D  Putting on clothes that don't fit can be a terrible feeling.  Buy one outfit that fits.  There is no shame in wearing clothes that fit your body. I would like to jump on this comment. 

Do not let inanimate objects make you feel bad. If clothes don't fit, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with you, it just means they don't fit. Find clothes that make you feel wonderful since at job interviews there are larger things to focus on than feeling bad in your own skin/ clothes.  Oh girl, I know how you feel! Sometimes, when life gets busy or stressful, we gain some weight. Shit happens. But, please don't let this trump the fact that you have also spent the last few years in college, working to better the inner parts of yourself. You were also dressing for an interview for an internship, another step forward in the category of "life successes" that has absolutely nothing to do with your physical image of yourself. Why are you letting this idea of yourself as being " too fat for your clothes" get in the way of all the really hard work you've done to get yourself to this morning? You are a STRONG, TALENTED, INTELLIGENT, AMAZING woman, and all of those qualities far outweigh whatever image of yourself you've procured today. 

I know that looks and skinniness is a big deal in our modern, media-driven culture, and I know how easy it is to slip into self-deprecation when clothing doesn't fit the way you want them to. But no one else in the street is going to think thoughts about you that are as nasty as the ones you've come up with in your head, and your weight gain isn't going to lessen all the ways that you've grown and changed. You have to stop letting this kind of shit absolutely ruin you, stop abusing yourself about it, and have a great day. You are a fucking powerhouse, an unstoppable force, and no one can take your experiences and your worth away from you. Not even yourself, if you don't let it happen.  Oh girl, I know how you feel!

Did you make it to the interview? I just got back from it - I think I have a good shot of getting it!  I just got back from it - I think I have a good shot of getting it!   For future reference, stores like H&amp;amp;M or Forever 21 often have some business casual basics that you can get in a pinch. They won't last very long, but they are cheap and will get you through a couple wearings.

What part of your mentality do you feel is unhealthy? It's okay to dislike changes caused by weight gain, as long as you recognize that you are not only the sum of your body parts and go about losing the weight in a healthy way. Don't feel like you are bowing to media standards or not "being a strong confident woman" or whatever because you feel better at a smaller size (unless you are actually happy with yourself now and only feel outside pressure to be skinny, then please disregard all this). The part that bothered me is as soon as I couldn't fit I hated myself for it. And then I hated myself for hating myself. Does that make sense? I was spiraling and the linchpin was my weight. I feel stupid for letting something like my body fill me up with horrible feelings.  Oh man, I've totally been there.  I used to be the super skinny one and could eat whatever and not exercise and then when I hit 23, I noticed that it had caught up with me.  I had no idea how to eat properly or exercise or anything--it took me 2 years of denial (and a poorly timed major depressive episode) before I was able to realize that 1) I was no longer 110 lbs 2) that I was actually more like 210 lbs and 3) the old 34A bra wasn't fooling anyone.  I remember the same situation as you--I was dressing for an interview and none of my interview clothes fit and I felt horrible and fat and disgusting.  I imagined that I could feel the rolls jiggling as the bus went over bumps in the road.

One of the first things I did was to go out and buy some clothes that fit.  It's not defeat, it's accepting reality.  You have to accept who you are to be able to identify what you want to change and if you want to change anything.  **Acceptance and self love is not being ok with yourself unconditionally.**  It's a sense of self awareness and a realistic idea of who and what you want to be.  If reality and your ideal self line up, fantastic.  If not, you know who you are and you can take the appropriate steps to get to where you want to be.  Take that hate and use it to motivate you to get to where you want to be. You accept who you are, you know where you want to be and you don't want to feel like you hate yourself again so you stick to the plan you've made.  

Additionally, wearing clothes that fit makes you feel better and more confident.  That 34A bra gave me perpetual bruising under my breasts and was very obviously too small.  My size 5 pants and small tees were too tight and made me look and feel heavier than I was.  Wearing size 12 pants and large tops and a 38D made me look less heavy because they fit.  Dress the body you have now, not the body you want to have later.  You will look and feel so much better and it's a great way to force yourself to accept the reality.  No one knows what number the tag says but you and the saleslady.  Hit up Goodwill or forever 21 and get something cheap, professional and that fits.

The next thing I did was I hired a trainer.  I was super poor and this was before I was in school but I put an ad on the gym bulletin board, explained my situation and asked for help.  A very nice and professional bodybuilder trainer (seriously the guy trains people for national and world competitions and is in crazy high demand) offered to work with me for 2 sessions--1 for diet and 1 for working out--for $40 total.  Your school likely has a rec center and likely has a kinesiology program--ask the front desk students to put you in touch with one of the student orgs for that program and ask if anyone can help you out to get you started.  They will be clamoring for the opportunity for the experience, I promise--kinesiology students remind me of labrador retrievers in that they are eager, energetic and want to help people to the point of desperation.

I insisted that I was eating well--I had stopped eating fast food and cut out most desserts and sweets and was annoyed at the trainer's skepticism.  To prove him wrong, I ended up tracking my food on myfitnesspal (free app for phone and desktop) and it made me realize 2 things.  The first was that holy shit I was not eating anywhere near as healthily as I thought I was.  I thought I was eating around 2000 calories and that was what I was supposed to be eating.  I was ending up around 3500 and that was when I thought I was eating healthily!  I need to be eating around 1300-1400 for my size and activity level just for maintenance!  My portions were huge and my choices were mostly processed, cheap convenience food. Instead of just flinging myself into eating celery and water only forever (which I'd tried and failed at several times) I instead just ate what I usually ate but cut the portions in half.  This saved me a lot of money and also made it a lot easier to adjust to the lifestyle change I was heading into.  After a while of exercising a lot (I recommend lifting weights and resistance training over cardio, especially for someone with limited time.  It takes less time per session to get a good workout in and you get more bang for the time you do spend because you continue to burn calories long after you're done) I started craving better diet choices.  The first one I remember was avocado.  I was going to make some boxed thing and I thought "I would kill for an avocado right now"--so I went to the grocery store, bought 2 avocados and ate the shit out of them.  I used to hate them and think that they tasted like nothing but they were so flavorful and delicious from that moment on.  That happened with a lot of fresh food over time and I was able to totally overhaul my diet slowly and in a sustainable manner.  I still eat "bad" food but I find that most of it is just unappealing and tastes like salt and more salt.  The stuff I do indulge in, I can't really eat a whole lot of it before I lose interest.

Another thing regarding weight loss is that it really requires a total lifestyle change.  Trying to change everything all at once is not sustainable--make small changes that you can maintain until they become habits.  You also have to be realistic.  I knew when I started that I could never get back to 110.  I made it to 140 and was happy with that until I was able to invest more time and effort into it about a year or so later.  Now I'm between 125 and 130 and I'm maintaining with mostly diet and a very hilly college campus and am happy here.  After I graduate, I will probably start lifting again because I'll have more time and enjoy it--I'll likely lose some more weight but if I don't, I'm ok with that too.  My ultimate goal was 130 (just under overweight BMI for my height and frame) and I've met/exceeded and maintained it for several years.

One last thing for weight loss success is planning planning planning.  I know it's annoying but if you plan ahead, you'll be able to eat much better.  I pack a lunch every day because the food on campus is mostly fast food or healthwashed junk food.  The Freshens stand makes me livid because they are all like "Look!  Fruit!  We're healthy!" and it's all just ice cream with flavoring or fruit tossed in.  One "smoothie" is most of the recommended caloric intake for an active adult female. Same for the Vitamin water.  It's watered down Kool Aid--literally it's sugar, flavoring and water.  And don't get me started on Luna bars.  Anyway--it's a lot easier to eat well if you bring food in your bag.  I usually keep some trail mix (1 serving is usually 1/4 cup!), some fruit, some other snack, a sandwich or wrap and a yogurt for breakfast and that'll keep me for most of the day.  Watch the serving sizes and learn to read nutritional labels.  A serving of trail mix out of the bulk bin is 1/4 cup and that's 140 calories.  It's a good once a day snack because there is a lot of nutrition packed in most of them and they are generally filling but along with the dense nutrients are dense calories.  If I go out to eat, I bring a tupperware or ask for a box when I order and won't touch my food until half is away.  I know I'll eat the whole thing if I don't so I plan ahead.  I buy easy to prepare fresh foods for during the week or make things in the slow cooker--I know I won't want to cook a nice meal after getting home from school so I plan ahead so I don't resort to things that are bad for me.

Losing weight is hard but if you want to do it, it's something that you can accomplish.  You are smart, capable and totally amazing.  You are not your appearance, your appearance is a part of who you are.  If you want to change, great!  but do it the right way.  If you realize that you're happy with yourself, also great!  but be honest and don't accept a defeatist attitude because you think you can't change.  You can and you're totally able to do anything you set your mind to.  &amp;lt;3!!  If it makes you feel better, professional clothes for women are ridiculously formfitting in general and womanly curves tend to develop around the college age. I've had more cursing matches aimed at professional clothes than any other type of attire. I had a button pop on one of my dress shirts last week and I felt self-conscious about it all day. I have to wear a size bigger in most professional clothes than I do in casual clothes because they're so tight and unforgiving.

I remember thinking I had a ton of great professional clothes when I was younger, and soon realized that my idea of professional clothing was somewhat inappropriate anyways. Sure it would be nice to be someone who always fits into their high school prom dress, but there's nothing wrong with growing and developing and updating what you wear.

I can't wear button-down shirts anymore. Haven't been able to in years, which really sucks because I *love* the look. Mais non - unless I sew it shut (which looks like shit) I'll never get rid of the boob gap (which looks like shit). Even if I wear baggy-to-the-point-of-looking-like-a-parachute sizes, it doesn't work. And it looks like a, well, parachute. 

At some point you just accept that some styles are permanently off-limits, sigh, and move on.   &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 Internet Hug!!! &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3.

Everyone gains weight in Uni... it's a fact. Don't worry. It is all the stress, bad food, napping, and most of all- drinking. 

For the moment, concentrate on your successes and your drive to finish school and get a good job. You can "fix" yourself later if that's what you want. 

Don't punish yourself by not buying clothes that fit. Listen to Stacey and Clinton from What Not to Wear. You need to feel confident to get a job, to do well in school, and most of all, to be motivated to take care of yourself. 

When you go shopping, don't pay attention to the g*d-dam% tag number either. Pay attention to what fits and how it makes you feel. Let yourself feel good in your new clothes, don't berate yourself because they're a higher size then you bought 3 years ago. 

Buy pretty accessories that complete the outfit. Splurge a little. You *deserve* it. 

Most of all, remember that your weight does not define you. Weight is a transient thing. *After* you buy yourself some outfits that you feel confident and wonderful in, then you can start to evaluate changes you want to make in your life to lose weight or just get more in shape. (Keeping in mind that with college type stress, you might not lose the weight for a long while. [Stress Sucks, here's a good article though](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/can-stress-cause-weight-gain).)

Also, if you go the exercise route to try to relieve the stress and lose weight, etc, reddit has some really awesome communities that are super nice and helpful. /r/yoga , /r/running , /r/loseit , /r/Paleo, /r/xxfitness  . 

In summary, you're not alone. You are loved. And if you live near Denver, I'll go shopping with you. :D  When I first started living with my ex-fiancee in the second year of college I became upset and angry with my weight and extra fat I had put on. I'd sit there sad and pitying myself until one night my ex-fiancee got fed up of my crying and told me, "Then fucking do something about it."

It hurt, and I was *pissed* at him, but after that (that night) I started working out and calorie counting. Lost 10 pounds in a month.

So, downvote me if you want, but:

**Fucking do something about it**.    I honestly had this experience this week. It's heartbreaking, I know. I"m a graduate student, which leaves precious little time for, well, anything. And to top it off, the stress has been driving me to drinking regularly. I've put on roughly 50lbs in the past two years, and while it's slowed now, I certainly am not feeling good. Two and a half years ago, I got married. I was wearing size six or eight shorts on my honeymoon. A year later I quit wearing pants, in lieu of comfortable flowy skirts. I looked good and felt good. This past week I had to buy a pair of jeans for a weekend outing in cold weather. I am a size 17/18 now. I've literally put on ten sizes. I feel disgusting and can't stand the way my body feels or moves. I sweat nonstop and my back hurts from having to bend to accommodate my ass and hips when I try to sleep. I went from a nice C cup, to a  triple D. I don't know whose body this is, but I want mine back.  It's not 10 sizes, it's 5... we count by 2s in sizes. Don't make yourself feel worse!  = ) 

I mentioned Grad school in my comment, too. I don't think people get it... your ass is reading and studying *all the time,* and if you aren't doing that, you feel guilty. You eat foods and drink sodas and coffee for energy instead of sustenance. Half my classmates are alcoholics, and I was definitely abusing it (often just to relax and be able to sleep) before I hit the brakes on that. I only allow myself to drink once a week on Friday night, and a 2 drink max on the rare nights the husband and I go out for dinner. 

I just started working out again, and it helps a lot. Tonight, for example, I am going to Zumba, and I want to watch How I Met Your Mother when I come home, so I am working on school stuff today until I head to the gym. My work schedule is all over the place, but structuring out time when I do school, when I work, and when I work out has made me more clear headed and motivated. 

Grad school sucks the life out of you, though. It's a masochistic endeavor.   Sounds like you're wanting to get fit again.  Don't feel bad about it, just start eating better.  As long as you're consuming less calories than you are expelling, you will lose weight.  Its easy to underestimate caloric intake.  /r/fitness has some good advice if you're interested.

I don't mean to sound so preachy but if you are interested, you might wanna check out /r/keto  I'm curious as to why people down-vote this.  I may be biased (I'm also a fairly new ketoer), but this was offered in a very non-pushy friendly and supportive way.  OP doesn't need to go on a diet if that's not what she wants, but if she was interested, here's something that has worked for some of us.  

BUT SERIOUSLY--people down-vote my question but don't answer it.          r/keto do it!! /r/keto for the lazy.  It's a good way to self regulate calories because ketogens usually make you feel very satiated, and it helps to avoid insulin spikes and carb binges.  It's just calories in vs. calories out like every other working weight loss strategy, though.  Are you still at a healthy weight?  Do you get an annual wellness exam to rule out any health issues? Do you know your numbers?  Not just weight and measurements, but BMI, BP, heart rate, cholesterol, glucose?  Don't think all that can wait until you're "older".  Knowing your numbers now can help you recognize when your health is going off the rails later.

Exercise isn't for losing weight, it is an investment for your future health.  Choose to do it purposefully, for flexibility, strength and a strong heart.  

If you don't eat mindfully, you're probably consuming more calories than you realize, without balance.  Find a tracker and use it to make best food choices.  Sparkpeople.com has a good one.

No one gave me the fucking talk about choosing health. That isn't about self-worth or good self image, it is about knowing your body is what you're living your life in, and giving that body the best care you can.  Poor health gets in the way of a fulfilling life.  I'm not talking about genetics, diseases or conditions which cannot be changed, but about lifestyle choices which undermine us as humans.   Anytime you want to hear about how to fuck it up, I'll happily share my stories.

Good luck, kick ass, and have fun.  You'll be fine.       Could it just be that you've grown more? I know I went through a growth spurt after my last year of college. I did gain some weight, but not a lot and I look pretty much the same. The weight gain might be attributed to weight lifting, idk. Anyway I look at my body now an pretty much look the same as I always have. However, if I try to fit into the dress pants I wore for my internship in my last year of college, it's like.. I don't know how I ever fit into them. I don't think I would look healthy if I was that small and I wouldn't have guessed it was even physically possible for me.

Then again, back in college I barely ate. I had classes, internships, and a job, so I would eat during breaks, which wasn't often. But I didn't eat healthy either, so who knows. Maybe it was weight gain, but I don't feel any fatter now than I've felt in the past. I really do think my hips just got wider.

We've had a rough life together, our mom was an abusive drug addict throughout our childhoods but our father was a psychotically religious, conservative tyrant (weird, I know, they got divorced when my sister was an infant and both went completely off the deep end). Long story short, my brother and I ended up becoming very liberal, kind of just chilled out stoner types. We're both functioning working adults but are very pro-choice, very liberal. His longtime girlfriend is wiccan and volunteers for planned parenthood, that type of person. Our little sister "S" turned into one of the most confident, bad ass, take no shit young women I've ever met. She identified as christian but never judged anyone and was just the coolest strong person ever. A year ago she got married to her boyfriend of a few years who was much more religious than her. Within this first year she's become increasingly more religious and has started posting pro-life things and very religious updates more and more. All her new friends she got after getting married are young, married and obsessively religious and my brother is very worried about how they're influencing her. She recently had her first anniversary and amongst the typical "happy anniversary to my husband" type stuff she dropped this bomb "He is leading us as a family as God tells him to, and I do my best to submit to him as he leads." Wtf?! This girl is not even 25 and this is not the girl I grew up with that the boys were all afraid to even look at wrong. My brother is livid, mostly out of fear that he's losing his little sister. I'm trying my best to respect her choices, especially since she seems happy. However, this is only after one year of marriage and I'm worried about her in the future. Anyway, any of you experience something similar to this and how did you deal? We've all been crazy close over the years but I can definitely see this causing a rift in us.
TL;DR Little sister got married and is slowly turning from open-minded laid back christian to alarmingly conservative and, well, just kind of creepy...   The thing is, we can't change other people, not even our siblings, even if they mean much to us and even if they become people we don't know how to deal with any more. 

Sometimes it just doesn't work out. Yeah, I'm not really planning on trying to change her. She's an adult and if she's happy then good for her. It's really the whole "submitting" thing that got me. It's just so creepy sounding and so different than the girl I used to know We all change in our 20s I guess. Some people quite often and remarkably. My older sister first married when she was 23 and totally submitted, got divorced when she was 25, bought a house with our abuser together with her second husband at 26, still lives with our abuser but dumped the second husband at 28. I'm not in a position to question anyone's behavior any more. I had to let go of my complete family because they have become or always have been people I can't live with. 

So I just hope it turns out differently in your case because it's so hard to lose siblings that way. But maybe you can't help it.  You're her older sister. Talk to her. Not with an agenda, but just to find out what's been going on. When she got married, did you end up spending less and less time with her? Not that that isn't normal, but when someone is in a controlling relationship, they tend to become isolated from friends and family.

Make yourself a presence in her life, and see if her husband reacts. If your sister evades you, don't let her. She's still young, and this is only the beginning of her marriage. She may be using this newfound religion as some sort of security blanket, she may be being brainwashed by her husband (who may have been brainwashed, himself, by his church).

This is not to speak against religion as a concept, but organized religion, when carried out, can sometimes get extreme. The best thing you can do is be in your sister's life and keep an eye on her. You are one of very few people who will be able to act on what's best for her, without ulterior motives.

Hope this helps! Thanks! Thats mostly what I was planning on doing. Thing is, right now we still have fun and she's still mostly who she's always been, it just seems like such a weird slippery slope. Then I worry about things like when they have children is her husband going to decide he doesn't want them around people like me and my brother and if she's being the good submissive wife, will she agree to it? Idk, its just weird to hear some of the stuff shes been saying and doing lately. It just seems really out of character for her but it's happening more and more Right, I understand the "slippery slope" feeling.

The point I probably should have been clearer in making is that if you and your brother stay in your sister's life, she will hear your voices and opinions in her head when big decisions come around, and not just her husbands' (which seems to be his intent, judging from her actions). Hopefully it will help keep things healthy and balanced.

She may be going through a period of personal change, but you never know unless you are the person.

As for the husband and your worries about him not wanting you all around - start being there now. If you don't get along with him at the moment, make an effort to. It'll be harder for him to assert any sort of unhealthy dominance if people who love and care for his wife make their presence known. Good advice. That's pretty much what we've been doing. He's actually a pretty cool guy, I don't necessarily want to give the impression that he's a jerk or anything. It's just that a lot of his beliefs seem really judgemental and backwards to me. I want to respect other people's beliefs, but if he's going to have my little sis following him around and waiting on him or letting him make all her decisions for him, that's not ok. But then again it is her life and if that's what she wants.. I will just be there for her as much as possible Thanks! Thats mostly what I was planning on doing.

Hope this helps!  Just going to throw this out here: **submission by choice is NOT a bad thing and people need to stop making it out to be.** Folks are undoing years of work by saying the choice to submit to her husband is a bad thing. I'd also like to point out that submission in the spiritual role is not about being a doormat. If she were to indulge in the BDSM style submission lifestyle that had no association with religion, would you still be upset?

On a religious level, I think we should break things down a little more. Prior to the passage on submitting to your husband it makes it extremely clear that everyone should submit to everyone. The idea being that we should set our lives on a course that is best for everyone involved, to support and love one another and to accept our differences. In a marriage context it is about giving yourself completely to your husband and him to you. It is about **both** individuals putting their own needs aside to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Again, submission in this model is not about being a doormat, jumping to rub your man's feet as he eats the dinner you just prepared. It is about leaving selfishness at the door - putting the needs of him ahead of yourself (and I think it is key to note here, that there is a call to put EVERYONE before yourself - but not to the negligence of your own life). Paul notes that women are free and equal before Christ, and spiritually equal in life (I'm being picky here, because I don't believe in equality between humans, I believe in being equitable - different debate). 

Annyyway. Different interpretations for different subgroups of Christianity. I'd also like to add that, I once had the whole bad-ass facade going for me, in the end I realised I really wasn't all the happy. I was keeping folks out, I was scared of getting hurt, etc. Those things weren't healthy for me. Trying to be what I thought was the feminist badass, dominant, etc was not actually me, and trying to be that person was exhausting. In the end I figured, I probably am more of a submissive person and I'm truly happy now that I'm not longer pretending. People constantly demeaning this choice is infuriating. If your sister is happy, then you should do everything to support her, because it takes a lot to find a place you're happy with in life.   The beautiful thing about feminism is that it destroys societal expectations for gender roles. 

As long as she wants to be the way she is, there is nothing wrong with that, and while I understand you missing your sister, I think it is a very backwards move to tell her that "she is wrong". 

It should be her choice how she wants to be.  The beautiful thing about feminism is that it destroys societal expectations for gender roles.

It should be her choice how she wants to be.    I grew up in a very southern, conservative, christian part of the US and watched my best friend make the same transition. She was always Christian but after being married young it became a much larger part of her life. I too was worried that it was a result of her husband and was worried about the amount of control he had over her life. I pushed back and almost ended up losing her. It turned out that who she was becoming was actually who she wanted to be and she's actually quite happy. It took me a really long time to accept that her version of happy was so drastically different from mine. Now, there are tons of things we disagree about, and we're both open with our opinions, but we've managed to remain friends and close in each other's lives. A suspicion of actual abuse is one thing, but living the submissive wife lifestyle is a choice and one she has the right to make.          Is there anything wrong with her leading a more godly life?  I realize you stated that you are more of the liberal leaning drug using type and may not want your sister to go in the opposite direction, but what is wrong with her making this decision?  

You haven't lost her, she is just taking a different path in life than you.  Maybe you should be accepting of who she is becoming? 

Is she trying to push her new lifestyle off on you? When she starts talking about being "submissive" to her husband, yeah, I do personally feel there is something wrong about that. And she isn't pushing her lifestyle on us yet, but thats kind of what I was talking about when I said I was worried about how she'll change in the future.  I would talk to her and ask her what that meant. I am an atheist but got very curious about the whole 'submissive wife' thing when I saw it on a talk show and read a little bit on it. The whole gist of it is pretty much focusing on supporting your partner and letting him be the spiritual head of the household. A man who is doing his duty that way will be a good provider and helper and will treat his wife well, there is no biblical basis for abusing or disrespecting one's spouse.

Once I read about what it actually was and lurked a few message boards for womens' experiences with this, I realized it's not quite so dramatic as tv likes to make it out to be, and it's more just a philosophy of 'letting the husband be the man of the house'. 

Personally I think men and women are equal, but men don't feel manly thinking they are no different than a woman, so it's not a bad thing to let them feel masculine. What was that line from My Big Fat Greek Wedding? "The man is the head, but the woman is the neck. And she can turn the head any way she wants. "

The main thing is whether or not he is treating her well.  Is there anything wrong with her leading a more godly life?  I realize you stated that you are more of the liberal leaning drug using type and may not want your sister to go in the opposite direction, but what is wrong with her making this decision?  

You haven't lost her, she is just taking a different path in life than you.  Maybe you should be accepting of who she is becoming? 

Is she trying to push her new lifestyle off on you? It's not really an issue of godliness, if my sister/brother/friend told me about his/her plan to  "submit" as their SO "leads", I would become concerned. 

There's nothing wrong or judgmental about OP being concerned at this point. It would be weirder if she just accepted it Is there anything wrong with her leading a more godly life?

Is she trying to push her new lifestyle off on you? Isolation and dominance are two signs of spousal abuse.  I'm not saying that she is being abused, but such a sudden drastic change in personality and personal relationships can be a cause for concern.

I'm not clear on exactly how isolated the sister is becoming, but the comment about "new friends" makes me wonder if she has been cut off from her old ones. I'm definitely not worried about him abusing her. It's mostly that I'm concerned she's eventually going to adopt that "holier than thou" attitude that a lot of her friends seem to have and cut us out of her life. I've always supported her faith even though I don't agree with it. I even painted a mural on her youth group's wall for free. I wasn't too concerned about her until I read that "submit to his lead" bullshit. I respect religion as much as a non-religious person can, but when one of the tenets of the faith is for women to submit to men just because they're the "leaders" of the house, I'm sorry but I pretty much lose all respect right there I'll note that I was speaking of emotional/psychological abuse, not necessarily physical.  A spouse that is unreasonably controlling and/or erases a person's agency to make decisions qualifies as an emotional abuser.  There are many perfectly happy Christian couples who do not fit this description, but again I just wanted to make sure that potential emotional abuse or coercion is not a concern here. I'm definitely not worried about him abusing her. It's mostly that I'm concerned she's eventually going to adopt that "holier than thou" attitude that a lot of her friends seem to have and cut us out of her life.

I've actually spent some time working with church counselors where I'm from.  

In a Christian household generally the concept of "submitting" to the man in the marriage consists of when push comes to shove let him make the call and let the chips fall where they may.  This is because when you go to be judged for your life it is the man who must account for his household and not the woman.  Whether I like that mentality or not is of no consequence as it is church doctrine.

While the term submission may be used it does not necessarily mean silenced.  In my relationship both parties are heard an discussion is a regular occurrence, but if we can't come to an agreement (albeit rarely) the man in the relationship will get his way for better or worse and will learn from it.

As others have stated, I don't know your sisters particular situation closely but at least this way maybe you can get a possible other side of the coin.  Do absolutely keep an eye out for her because it's what I do for my sister, but try and assume the best until reason otherwise.

I wish you the best of luck with the situation! I mean no disrespect, but even the way you describe makes me very uncomfortable and seems incredibly unfair to the wife. Point being are you going to marry someone who you don't trust their decision making?  You have to believe that after hearing all thoughts on the matter that he will make what he believes is the best decision for the family.

Marriage isn't two individuals it's one team.  I know it sounds scary but you'll understand when you find that person who is everything you're looking for.  Hopefully you won't settle for someone who you don't trust their judgement. I'd rather marry someone who's decision making I don't completely trust than marry someone who believes he should have the final say in our family no questions asked. I see we just have a different viewpoint on marrying someone with sound decision making skills.

It doesn't have to be him having the final say and you having no voice.  I won't guess with your romantic history but trusting your SO is important no matter what family structure you have. I mean no disrespect, but even the way you describe makes me very uncomfortable and seems incredibly unfair to the wife.      </snippet></document><document><title>I feel violated, but I'm worried I am overreacting. Help?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19730i/i_feel_violated_but_im_worried_i_am_overreacting/</url><snippet>Husband and I are divorcing. I haven't filed because I wanted him to have health insurance. We've been living apart for a couple of months after he asked me to get out. Tried three therapists, it's not going to get better, I'm done with the marriage and have told him so.

He keeps randomly showing up at my new place. First he stopped by on Valentine's Day to drop off a "present" for me. $300.00 in new dishes from Macy's. I tried to give them back, he insisted on me keeping them. (They're unopened in their boxes)

Yesterday he shows up with some deck chairs I forgot to pack when I moved out, that I never cared about. Insists on bringing them inside, and proceeds to walk through my bedroom and bathroom before I politely and firmly ask him to leave. He manages to break the lock on my screen door before leaving, and wants to hang out and help me fix it. I tell him no, and ask him again, to please leave. 

He texts me 5 minutes after leaving saying "I hope you were cleaning your bathroom today, because I noticed your toilet seat was in the up position. Either that or you're sleeping with a lot of men and they didn't bother putting the seat down."

**What. The. Fuck. WHO notices that?** I am really creeped out by his sudden need to stop by and randomly say hello. I asked him to please stop with that, and he went off on me saying if I wasn't doing anything shameful or guilty, what's the big deal. Am I crazy for finding this intrusive? :(

**UPDATE** Went to see my therapist tonight, she agrees it's time to stop being polite and set some stronger boundaries in place. I will be filing this week, and adding security to my house. I'm scared he is going to act out once he is served with the divorce papers, so I may go hide out with family for a little while. THANK YOU everyone for your advice and help    1.  File.  Health insurance will stay in effect during the divorce, and can be a point of negotiation in any settlement.  My ex stayed on my plan until the divorce was final (costing me hundreds of $$ a month), and I booted him off the policy the day I was free from him.

2.  He is trying to exercise some control over you, and that can be done under the guise of being nice.  Set boundaries, explain them to him very clearly, perhaps in writing, and stand firm on them.  Do not hesitate to call the police if he enters your home without your permission.

3.  He may be trying to gather evidence (of your alleged infidelity) for use against you in the divorce. Again, set boundaries, and call the police if he enters your home without permission.

It's going to get worse before it gets better, but *it does get better*.  

 Thank you. I have checked with HR this morning, he will have insurance for 60 days after the divorce is final. He can choose to pay COBRA and keep the coverage, or ask his employer to begin insuring him from that point forward. Since he loves to go to the doctor with numerous ailments and mental issues, I'd imagine he will be less than happy to hear he won't have my top-notch health insurance, but time to stop being nice..  Is there any chance he was looking for evidence to help him in the divorce? You're still married, so sleeping with other people would count as adultery.   Many places have no-fault divorce, so it really depends on where OP lives. In those jurisdictions, evidence of adultery doesn't affect divorce proceedings in any way. I'm in a no-fault state. I haven't done anything as far as adultery, regardless. As silly as this sounds, the toilet seat wasn't up, because I know I had used it just a few minutes prior to his showing up. He does things like this, and tries to convince me what I know isn't "right" or "valid" &amp;gt;He does things like this, and tries to convince me what I know isn't "right" or "valid"

yikes. Yeah. I know. I'm not proud of it, but I was in a severely screwed up relationship/marriage for a long time and couldn't see it.  I really have nothing to offer except best of luck extricating yourself from that marriage. &amp;lt;3 Thanks! Sailormoon fan I'm assuming? Tsukino Usagi always a favorite. Yeah. I know. I'm not proud of it, but I was in a severely screwed up relationship/marriage for a long time and couldn't see it.  Based on your story and his gaslighting behavior, you may be married to a narcissist or someone with a similar disorder. You may want to look it up-- Narcissists do not think the same way we do and are difficult to understand.

Is it considered adultery if the married couple is separated and/or living apart?  There are two big emotions/motivations for this type of behavior after a breakup/divorce.

1. He is getting lonely now that it's officially "over" and therefore is pulling on you to get that attention back in his life. He probably thought it would be simple to find someone else (guys like this tend to have an overinflated ego), but now that he finds it isn't that easy, he goes to you. He is acting is like a 6-year old pulling on mommy for attention. It's nothing more than annoying, and you shouldn't have to put up with it.

2. However, that passive-aggressive comment about you "sleeping with other men" - yep, he's getting paranoid that you're moving on faster than he is. He is probably feeling resentful, bitter, and insecure, and he is wondering if you're satisfying you're loneliness elsewhere. This bitterness is leading to paranoia, and unfortunately he's giving into that and is willing to act on it now - at the expense of your happiness and well-being.

The combination of these two things can lead to more dangerous behavior: in his loneliness and paranoia, he could wind up waiting outside of your house at night to see if anyone comes over -- and if he does spot you confirming his paranoid suspicions by having a guy over for some reason, he might do something crazy like stalk you further or risk a break-in to validate his paranoia. 

If I were in your position, I would start looking into moving NOW -- and when you do, don't give him your new address. I would also consider moving in with people, like a supportive girlfriend, so that you don't live alone. The way he views (and treats) you now is disrespectful and is borderline stalker behavior. If you have to stay in your current place for a while, consider changing or reinforcing the locks as he has already gotten a good look at them; letting a neighbor know what's going on an having them check up on you ever now and then; or see if you can get someone to temporarily stay with you during the time when you are transitioning into a new place. This may sound like a paranoid approach, but his actions now tend to preclude more dangerous types of behavior, and I have no problem with OP being a little paranoid as opposed to leaving herself at risk to being assaulted (or worse). 

You tried to save the marriage; it didn't work. He needs to move on, and he should be willing to allow you to as well. Do what you can to make sure you are in a place where you can feel comfortable and secure in where you are and who you are. He will have to work out his own issues.  Wouldn't a restraining order be a little easier than uprooting and moving again?  The police will only grant you a restraining order if you can **prove** that the person **threatened to abuse you.** In most cases of harassment however, the perpetrator is not going to be that obvious, e.g. they don't send text messages with blatant threats, but find other ways to harass you (subtle passive aggressive hints like OP's ex is doing.) Unless her state has very different laws from CA's, she probably won't be granted a restraining order. Also, those requests can take time.

I attempted to file a restraining order against an ex who texted me the words "slut" "whore" "cheating cunt" etc. over a hundred times after we split. I was denied this request because he didn't directly threaten me.

[Soure: CA Courts Website](http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-domesticviolence.htm) He's never actually threatened me. Physically, he isn't intimidating at all, but he's a genius and a master of manipulation. Sadly, a restraining order would accomplish nothing.

Financially, I'm not in a position to uproot myself again just yet. While I make a decent living, I used a lot of my savings to get out a few months ago.  I let him keep just about everything, because him and his mother had already began declaring me a gold digger. (He makes twice as much as I do, but I've never taken a dime from him, and I refuse to give my engagement ring back) Sorry if this is a rude question, but why refuse to give the engagement ring back? If it'll take away his fuel for accusing you of being a gold-digger, that's a good thing. I don't really understand why you would want to hold on to a piece of jewelry that will only remind you of a marriage that didn't work out. I guess I'm a believer in ridding yourself of unnecessary sentimental objects. Get them out of your house (or in this case, off your body) and out of your mind/heart.

I should also mention that I've never been married or engaged, so I've never been faced with the decision to keep or return an engagement ring.   You're not crazy, it's definitely intrusive. Is it possible he's taking your not filing for divorce as a sign that maybe the marriage can still be salvaged?   I suppose it's possible, but he would have to be pretty delusional to think so. I've made it extremely clear we're done. He has even asked to hang out "as friends", and I've refused to do so because I don't want to deal with leading him on.   I wish I could tell you his behavior was freakish, but actually I've seen it a lot. It's a combination of paranoid/controlling behavior, and it has to do with his insecurity about you moving on with your life. He's trying to find a way to smear you (even if only in his own mind/heart, but possibly much worse) so he doesn't have to feel like it's HIS failing that your marriage is over. That said, I have personally witnessed many scenarios like yours turn into something very bad and dangerous, so please, please watch out for yourself.

1) Never let him into your home again. He is obviously becoming malicious and you have no idea where that's going to go. Please trust me on this one. 

2) If you haven't already, start logging all your contact with him and any messages he's sending you. If that means taking screenshots of text conversations and saving voicemails, then do it. You may need to keep these as evidence if you eventually end up filing a restraining order, or you might need to use it as part of your divorce proceedings. You never know. You will be really glad to have these records if things escalate. 

3) Get some kind of home protection like a baseball bat and some pepper spray. Possibly have an alarm system installed along with a video camera that can see who's outside your front door. Consider moving. 

4) Stop communicating with him on anything but the most functional things. (Honestly, I think you should stop communicating with him altogether, but that's just me.) That is to say, when he texts you with stuff like that re: other men, don't respond to it, don't acknowledge it, pretend like it didn't happen. (Except don't forget to take those screenshots and log it!) If he sends you an e-mail asking where you've been since you haven't answered your door in a week, don't answer. When he accuses you of sleeping around because he hasn't seen you in a while, let it lie. Arguing with him over these things isn't going to get you anywhere and it will only feed his need to keep in contact with you.

Good luck. Stay safe.  I figured out my iPhone is GREAT for screencaps! At the advice of a paralegal friend, I have been saving the pics to my phone and uploading for a digital copy in case something happens to the phone. (Or me.)

Thank you for the advice though-- I am getting an alarm and a new door/lock installed this week. Hopefully by Friday.

My only concern is we haven't filed our taxes yet. Since he is an accountant, he usually just takes my information and files it, but I don't even want to be in the same room with him to do this simple task.     Does he have a key to your new place or do you keep letting him in? If the former, CHANGE. YO. LOCKS. If the second, cut off contact with him and document every event in case you end up needing a restraining order. No, he does not have a key. He asked for one when I moved, in case of an emergency, but I said I didn't feel comfortable with that and he accepted it. He would show up, I'd answer the door, and he'd have something in his hands and push past me to enter the foyer. 

I'm not letting him in anymore. I was trying to be polite, but I'm done with that now. No, he does not have a key. He asked for one when I moved, in case of an emergency, but I said I didn't feel comfortable with that and he accepted it. He would show up, I'd answer the door, and he'd have something in his hands and push past me to enter the foyer. 

I'm not letting him in anymore. I was trying to be polite, but I'm done with that now. Ok, I couldn't quite tell from your post, so just making sure. Like I said, keep a record of everything he does in case it starts to get worse. It might seem stupid or redundant to you, but if it comes down to a legal battle of any kind, a record you kept over time as the events were happening *will* mean a lot. And it can be as simple as a Word doc or a Gmail thread to yourself, where you write down what you wrote here and how you responded to each situation and how it made you feel.       First, I don't know your husband, and I don't know your situation.

Second, when I read this, it just made me really sad. The story makes it sound like he misses you, hopes you haven't replaced him, and wants to be around you. His posturing and annoying commentary seems like he is trying to protect himself, while desperately seeking your affection.

That's not to say telling him to gtfo isn't the right thing to do. If you are uncomfortable with his affections and don't feel the same way, there is no reason to put up with it.  That's how my stalking x-bf started. Dont let him in again and if you do, call 911 and ask for a domestic stand-by. In front of the police, tell him he is not welcome there, and stick to your guns come hell or highwater. Meet in public from here on out. Period.   Restraining. Order. Now. He's never threatened me with physical harm.  No judge is going to grant me a restraining order based on what has happened.</snippet></document><document><title>Hey guys... I'm in a music video!

It also might trigger if you have sexual assault experience.

It's been one and a half year since I last saw and talked to my birthgiver. We've exchanged 3 or 4 e-mails since that included no personal words but only forms the one or the other had to fill out. It's been half a year since I decided to remove the title "mother" from her person.

It's been a year since I last saw my sister. I've texted with her once since then.

She didn't tell me about her second divorce. My brother did. It's been 8 weeks since I last texted my brother. I see him twice a year or so. I text with him sometimes in between. He's called me several times during the last year when he was close to suicide and I maneuvered him out of it.

And I almost forgot to mention him, but it's been two years since I wrote the last mail to my father, telling him that I don't want our conversations to pass through my sister, that I hate he doesn't talk to me directly, and that I hate that he never calls, writes, texts me and that he always fights against financing my studies which he has to by law. I told him unless he changes, I don't want contact. I didn't get a reply.

Still I don't strip him off his title. He's not done much to deserve being called a father, but he's not done anything so bad he deserves to have this title removed either.

I grew up with sexual violence and neglect. My parents divorced when I was little because my father was physically abusing my birthgiver. 

My birthgiver proceeded to sexually assault me and got herself a boyfriend who did worse things to me. 

There was no physical violence except of the occasional rape. We weren't beaten, we had clothes and food.

The boyfriend eventually was thrown out when he tried to rape my birthgiver. A bigotry I can't and won't forgive.


The last time I saw my whole family was at my sister's second wedding. I spent two nights at the house of my childhood. I slept 2 hours in the first night and none in the second. Instead, I creeped about the house, feeling it would be my last chance to dig in the remains of my childhood and search for *proof*. I found it. As soon as the sun was up, I grabbed my things and some photo albums and walked 2 hours to the train station.

A few months later they sold the house and my sister bought a house with my birthgiver. 

I don't think I'll talk to her again in the next few years.

I know it was the right decision to loose them. I can't maintain contact. Every time I try, I end up with a panic attack and/or close to suicide. I can't act as if nothing ever happened.

I tried to talk to my brother. He's in therapy now. When I tried to tell him about the sexual abuse, I ended up in an interrogation via text until I told him I'll not talk about it to him again until he's ready for it. Until he has found his own memories. He has gotten the same treatment as me during that time. 

And yet it hurts.

I spent christmas with the family of a not-so-close friend and was close to crying the whole time.

I feel everything that I have *lost*.

I won't ever have a sister or brother to talk to again. To just feel close without having to perform something.

I lose the kids I spent my childhood with. I lost the kids who were there when I lost my teeth, I lost the kids I watched learn to read and write. And the worst thing is they're still there and we just can't be close. We can't.

I tried being close with my sister. But she resents me, and I suspect it's because she's fighting her own war with her memories. I can't help her with that. She never believed me when I tried to tell her the truth.

I won't try to be close with my birthgiver. Ever. The person who never admitted anything, by tried giving me esoteric "therapy" so that I "forget all the bad memories" which I couldn't have because nothing bad ever happened because she changed the past, but there was nothing she ought to have changed in the first place.

My father is a jerk. An alcoholic with no ability to maintain contact to his children. Seriously. If I'm not worth an e-mail in twenty years, he's not worth any more words.

My brother could be the only one I could talk to again. If he distances himself from the others. And if he manages to deal with his own issues. And when he grows older. And when I'm ready. And when he's ready. And if I know he's not talking to our birthgiver any more. But he won't take that step.

I've never felt as alive and free as I do now, after my decision to have no family any more. 

But I'm paying the price and it hurts. It fucking hurts. 

I live my life and I act as if I'm strong. I live as if it was alright to me. I laugh when I tell about my family and I show that I'm proud about having taken that step, which I am.

But I don't know anything in life that has ever hurt me so much.

Edit: words.  I am so, so sorry for what you've gone through, and for your loss.

I recently (last month) disowned my parents and moved out after the verbal abuse and constant triggers had gotten to be too much (the physical abuse, thank god, stopped when I turned 18.)

The first week was awful. I felt sick to my stomach. I knew I couldn't talk to my siblings about it -- they are still dependent on my parents (like you, I sometimes refer to them differently, usually as "biological parents"). 

As time goes on, it hurts less and less. As with all things. But it still sucks, and I still get panic attacks.

If you can find a good therapist you trust, do that. More importantly, spend as much time as possible with the people you love most, and who love you most. Have someone to talk to. Feel free to PM me if you need to vent.  I am so, so sorry for what you've gone through, and for your loss.

and milk oppressive panic from each beat.

As schisms fault and groan and tear apart,

the sharp-strained soul quails out a last retreat.

But bonds too tight can break and set us free:

Unchain to find a loving family. This is beautiful, and really hit the spot. Thank you. Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not weakness.  It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it. In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers. 

I believe that appreciation is a holy thing--that when we look for what's best in a person we happen to be with at the moment, we're doing what God does all the time. So in loving and appreciating our neighbor, we're participating in something sacred. When we love a person, we accept him or her exactly as is: the lovely with the unlovely, the strong with the fearful, the true mixed in with the fa&#231;ade, and of course, the only way we can do it is by accepting ourselves that way. The greatest gift you ever give is your honest self.  Today has reminded me that no matter how bleak things get, there are still some damned beautiful souls in the Universe. Does it balance things out? Maybe not, but it definitely makes continuing worth doing.

Thank you. Linguist here. The philology is a little bit messy, but "bleach" is basically the causative form of "bleak." And once you're nice and bleak, you can dye your life however you'd like! I am so, so sorry for what you've gone through, and for your loss.

/hugs all around! Thank you for the hugs; they are always appreciated :-).

Advice needed.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1976z2/i_am_pregnant_and_want_to_keep_the_baby_but/</url><snippet>I am using a throw away account for personal reasons. My story is complicated and at times it is even unbelievable. My husband and I have been together for about 5 years. He has a daughter that is almost 6. Going along with that daughter is a resentful and abusive mother that is unbearable to deal with or co-parent with. I do not want to get into the entire story leading up to my current predicament because it is really long, fucked up and hard to deal with.

 Lately, my husband and I have been wanting to have a baby of our own. We love each other and think it would be amazing to bond our DNA. Well, the day has come and I am pregnant! This appears to be amazing news, right? It would have been a few months ago. But, most recently, my husband's  paychecks started getting garnished for $700/mo for child support for falsified support claims made by the mother (she tried to claim $1000's in fake medical claims and pulled that when we asked for the proof. She also claimed that my husband never paid child support in 2 years. He did AND he put a roof over her head for a long time when she was homeless. The courts ruled with her and said that my husband had been negligent with money. Even though he paid for everything and has proof). This being said and done, there is no way we can afford this baby. 

I feel cornered. I really want to have this baby, but it would not be possible in our current financial situation. I was curious about adoption, but every time I see a baby, I start falling out in tears. I am raging so hard because I think to myself that if we didn't have to pay an obtuse amount of child support to a mother who's daughter claims she abuses her, I could have this baby. For the curious, examples of abuse: force fed hot sauce, forced to pee on bedroom floor several nights bc her door was locked, leaving her in the car with the windows rolled up, refuses her vegetables, kid gets in trouble for doing homework, I could go on. We have called DHS and they see no fowl play. My step-daughter even made her own police report against her mother. The police said that even if these accusations are true, they are not against the law. Parents do not have to feel their children vegetables, it is not unlawful to lock your kids in their rooms at night with no bathroom benefits, and she got a slap on the wrist for leaving a 5 and 2 year old in the car alone with the windows rolled up for long periods of time. Meanwhile, we can not afford a lawyer to file the appropriate papers and the mother REFUSES therapy for the child. We are stuck.

I am sorry for ranting like this, I know my story must seem _______ (insert negative adjective here). My hormones are all over the place. I am having a hard time even looking at my step-daughter because I know that if it were not for her mother being so unlawful and terrible, I would not have to give up my baby. I am very confused and sad. I am just wondering if anyone out there can shed any light on this subject.

TLDR; I am pregnant with a much wanted baby and a stressful and financial situation tells me I should give my baby up. Help needed.  You should not feel forced to give up that much wanted baby. I tell you this as a pro-choice anti-population rabid lesbian feminist. It's time to fight.   There are a lot of community resources even for families. You should not have to give up your baby because of the situation another woman is putting you in. Take this time before the baby is born to find a lawyer that will do it for free or for a discounted price, if you have all of the proof you say, it should be easy to find one that will sympathize with you. Fight for your step daughter, fight for your unborn child. I agree with the find a lawyer bit. Some lawyers will do work pro bono, and if you are any where near a law school, there's a chance you can get cheap/free legal advice.

Call some family law attorneys and explain the full story to them. Get your husband on board, too. Assuming you're being 100% honest here, it sounds like your husband's previous attorney didn't do a very good job if your husband got raked over the coals like that. You are 100% correct, my husband has been through 2 attorneys that have raked him under the bus. From what my last attorney said, there is no fixing what is in the past. What's done is done and we have to move forward. I hope we can get a good pro bono lawyer to take care of this mess..  It sounds to me like ending the pregnancy would be absolutely devastating to you and your husband. Your husband's problem is shitty but that doesn't mean you have to suffer the loss of a baby you really want to hand because of it. Yes, kids are expensive but there are many resources out there to help and you could always get another job or find other ways of income. There are many single mothers out there with far less resources (including mine) that have made it work. 

This is a very delicate topic and you didn't even mention how your husband feels about it. Don't make rash decisions because you feel stuck. Regardless of your choice, whether you decide to keep the baby or not, make sure it's the best possible decision for you and your family. Asking random strangers on the Internet isn't the best way to go.  I apologize for not speaking of my husbands feelings. He feels the same way I do. We both feel cornered. He makes 40k before taxes and deductions. This is too much money to qualify for free resources and after child support, insurance, and taxes, we barely have enough to make rent.  Get a job? The job thing is tricky. You see, we have our daughter Sun-Wed and her mother signed her up for school 20 miles away from our home (where she lives). I do have a job, but my schedule will only allow part time because of getting this child to/from school so far away. We spoke of this with the mother and she said she would not do anything she does not have to. Who has primary custody? I was able to find an attorney in the Detroit area, Phillip Holman (http://holmanfamilylaw.com), who seems to have a vested interest in Father's rights. 

It may also be an option that you could have child support granted to a third party, who would ensure that your husbands money is not being misused.

Don't give up the baby you want. There is a chance child support could be reduced since he would be supporting two children instead of one. It *is* worth going back and fighting, no matter what your last attorney moron told you. Fight for full custody of his daughter, too. Document every and any sign of abuse you see with photographs. The mother has primary custody. I am in Colorado and having the child support given to a 3rd party is not an option. A while back, our daughter was sent to school for 2 consecutive days in a coat that was full of mold. I know this because I volunteer and help teach kids at her school. On the 2nd day, I took the coat, replaced it with another and asked my attorney what could be done to ensure that the child support was being spent on our daughter and sadly, nothing can be done. Meanwhile, the mom has a new i phone, new car and a new baby. She gets it all. Our child support even WENT UP because she has another kid, with whom she is married to the father. Meanwhile, because of this, my baby has very little left over for its life. The system here seems to be written for failure.  Our child support even WENT UP because she has another kid, with whom she is married to the father. 

This seems the opposite of what should happen, surely she has support from another person so needs less support from him? The mother has primary custody.

As far as I knew, child support ended when the parent receiving support got remarried. Is this not the law in your state? Maybe you're thinking of alimony? Both parents still have a responsibility to their child, regardless of marital status. Oh yeah, that's the one. It really boggles my mind that his child support payments increased to pay for a child that wasn't his, especially when that father is involved with the mother. Shouldn't he be the one helping to pay for the girl....?  The mother has primary custody. I am in Colorado and having the child support given to a 3rd party is not an option.

That sounds like a horrendous situation, and I really wish I had an answer or any significant advice. 

IMO, I don't think you should or could give up your baby if you want him/her so badly -- giving him/her up for adoption would be something you'd regret your entire life. It's definitely understandable and responsible to worry about finances, but even if you'll be poor, you can still offer your child an amazing life by being a great and loving parent. Also, your financial situation can (and hopefully will) change.

Maybe it's naive... but I believe there has to be a way for you to scrape by and keep the baby. Do you have any friends/family you can lean on for support? Do you have a job of your own yet? If not, maybe you can find a way to make some extra income online or from home while you raise your kid (e.g., writing content online, starting a child care service from home, teaching dance/piano lessons or tutoring...).

This is also some advice I found that might help you save money:

   This may be a weird question, but would the responsibility of a new child (yours) cause a re-evaluation in your husband's child support payments? Given that he now has to split his finite resources between two dependents?

I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe I'm just ranting, maybe I need support or advice. 

I've been married for six years and have a 2 year old and I feel like the life is being sucked out of me. 

To start at the beginning:

We got married after being together for 6 months which seems fast but at the time seemed right. A few months after we got married, I caught him lying about small things, really insignificant things, we would talk it out with me reiterating that I'm alright with lying. But the lies continued, stupid stuff really, like he was going to meet some friends but would meet up with other people but as time moved on the lies got more serious like I caught him responding to casual sex ads on craigslist, his excuse was that he was just looking for chat sex stuff, not to meet up in person. Then I caught him in a huge lie, where he was  going to a friend's house but instead went to some group sex thing where you pay to watch. I was heartbroken. I should have ended the relationship but I didn't. He blamed me, told me that he couldn't tell me because his past girlfriends wouldn't approve so he didn't think I would. I tried to forgive him but honestly even after several years, I don't think I have. I just learned to not trust him.

Fast forward and we decided to have a baby, our relationship was never really rocky just weird at times but nothing really significant. After our baby was born, he was dad of the year, always helping, changing diapers, but after about a week, he just quit. It felt like he just checked out, I was left to 100% care for baby while he just sat on the couch and literally looked out the window. I asked, cried and begged for help and he would just get pissed and storm off, whenever I asked to him hold the baby so I could get a break, he would hold him for a few minutes and give him back with an excuse like he was hungry or had to use the bathroom. He stopped leaving the house and doing anything around the house and just became depressed. He was pissed that after 8 weeks postpartum that I wasn't interested in having sex and I would tell him that I'm only getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night and that I needed help with not only the baby but the house too, he would just balk and say he was uncomfortable around babies. 

So the baby and I were left to our own devices, I went back to work 6 months after baby and this is really where everything went bad.  He refuses to help in the morning, choosing to sleep in 7 days a week, he will not even get up to make our son breakfast on the weekends, he doesn't help with daycare drop off or pick up, he doesn't help cleaning the house, do laundry or really make dinners (maybe 1 night a week, he'll make dinner), he doesn't even hang out with our son except for the last hour of the night before baby goes to bed. He has never given our baby a bath and has only taken him outside of the house once alone since birth. I really feel like I'm single parent taking care of a baby and a moody teenager. 

My husband also gets really obsessed with things like games and technology and once he gets into something, that is all he does. He is never around on the weekend, like all day and night, barely spending time with our son and then he wonders why my son comes to me and wants me all the time. I have explained to my husband that I would like to do family things on the weekends and he told me that was unfair and prude-like because it's his weekend too and he should be allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. 

I don't bring up issues anymore with him because I don't feel "safe" in doing so, he gets very moody and if I bring up something and he isn't in the mood, he will get very upset and leave the room, ruining the rest of the day. So I just don't say anything. I don't really like going out to do things as a family with him because he makes me nervous because he is so moody. He gets frustrated with our son, if he gets loud or tired or wants to run around, he gets frustrated whenever my son cries and even told me that he clutches in jaw whenever he cries. So I'm constantly on edge when my son is crying or gets loud or acts like a toddler, from my perspective it seems like he wants our son to be seen not heard. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, also, when I do talk to him about something that is important to me but not him, he just tunes me out, like outright ignores, he has actually left the room when I was in mid-sentence.

He is really upset with me because of my lack of affection but honestly, after working all day, taking of my son and my husband acting a teenager, I just don't feel an emotional connection with him. Also, our sex life has a lot of ups and downs, mostly because he chooses to masturbate every day and it has left him with sensitivity issues where he can't have sex with me because he loses his erection which is zero fun for me, I get off on my partner getting off and I just can't get into when he obviously doesn't enjoy it. I have spoken to him about this and just brushes it off and doesn't see it as an issue.

I have finally come to a point, where I can't live like this anymore, like I want a divorce, he has refused marriage counseling twice and just treats his family like an obligation. We spoke a couple of weeks ago and I told him that I just don't think we have the same lifestyle and pretty much everything I have laid out here and now all of the sudden he was open to marriage counseling but I don't think I'm there anymore. For the past two weeks, we just don't talk like at all.

Our relationship is obviously not healthy and like I said I have no idea what I'm looking for posting maybe support, advice...   When you have a child and a spouse you *do not* get to do whatever you want, whenever you want.  He is part of a family, but it doesn't sound like he wants to be. Maybe try the counseling, but seriously?- maybe he's just afraid of losing his maid. 
Also, and please don't be offended, he is modeling to your son the way to treat significant others and your son's future children. 
Edited:typo  You want support? You got it. You're right, this is not the least bit healthy. Him becoming open now to marriage counseling is way too little, way too late. If you give him a chance now, you're going to get sucked back into this lifestyle. Why bother? Sounds like you're ready to get out, so now's the time. Go get the paperwork ASAP, and get this show on the road. Be civil, and be careful. He sounds like he could get very abusive. I don't know if you'll be asking him to leave, or what your stance is on that. But, if you will be the one leaving, have a close friend or family member who will be ready to take you and your son in/help you for a while. In my opinion, he should he the one leaving. You work, you raise your child and he does nothing. You're a goddamn superwoman, and he's just a chump. Get him out! 

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh to you, but the way he's acting is bullshit. You want support? You got it. You're right, this is not the least bit healthy.

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh to you, but the way he's acting is bullshit. [deleted] That's fine. I stand by what I said. The way she's describing this guy, I almost feel like I could peg him as one of my exes. I didn't see him as an abusive person, until he beat the shit out of me and held me up against the garage door by my throat. I'm not saying he's a definitive abuser, but I'm definitely not ruling it out. [deleted] Oh my god... I'm... Terrible at math.. You know me? :O  [deleted] How exactly am I perpetuating a stereotype by pointing out something that could very well be an indicator? FOR EITHER GENDER. Fucking kidding me? Oh fucking no, I'm advising her to be wary, end of days. I must be a man-hating dyke in shining armour. Uh hurr durr.  [deleted] You can read, yes?   I don't think he believes that you are SERIOUSLY at your breaking point. I've been through a similar position (working 2-3 jobs at the same time, and taking care of my daughter and ALL the cooking, cleaning, housework and yard work to my absent husband) but it's taken me 6 years to take action. I don't want you to be full of anger and regret. I don't want you to have serious trust issues. 
Stop whatever you are doing at the moment. Find a counselor. Make an appointment right now. You need someone who truly listens to your needs, allows you to vent and will work with you together to find a solution. (Ex. getting through your divorce or even working out your family relationship with your husband). If money is an issue, there are counselors who work on a sliding scale. And do you have any family or friends who you trust? Please, open up to them. This is not a burden that you should carry yourself. You are the most important person in your son's life. You deserve the joy and happiness that comes with being a parent. You deserve to have a fulfilling life. That was very refreshing!   Honestly it sounds like your husband is suffering from depression. If he is unwilling to work on it I think you are right in asking for a divorce. While I understand you are upset with him not being willing to go to marriage counseling because he hasn't wanted to go for so long I think it still might be worth a shot. If he has clinical depression he may need to be medicated and it may be an issue that can be fixed. If he is willing to go you may want to see if he is willing to see a physicatrist.

This guy sounds awful.  You don't have to live like this.    </snippet></document><document><title>I felt like I did the right thing. (Possible Trigger Warning)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19649a/i_felt_like_i_did_the_right_thing_possible/</url><snippet>I honestly thought that I would never post something like this, and I seriously hate to add on to the number of depressing posts. I gratefully apologize for posting this, but it's just something I really wanted to talk about. Keep in mind, this all happened a few minutes ago.

Outside my window I heard a couple arguing. Normally, I wouldn't think anything about it. So I opened my window, and the guy is going ballistic. He ended up grabbing the girl by her hair, and he starts shouting all these obscenities towards her. I couldn't believe my eyes at all. I've never seen anything like this happen. I got so disturbed to the point that I seriously shouted from my window to tell the guy to stop. However, my cries went ignored. As she was tearfully begging for him to stop he noticed me and paused for a moment. Eventually he stops, and decides to walk away with her phone.

I ended up walking towards the balcony to make sure that she was alright, and she spotted me. She asks me if she could see my phone. To be honest, I am a very scrawny guy and the fact that there was this big guy running outside scared me a bit. However, I couldn't allow her to be out there by herself. I went downstairs, and she just starts crying hysterically. Upon closer inspection, I saw that she was holding a baby. I wanted to get them to safety so I ended up leading them back to my apartment. I even made sure that he didn't see us. What disturbed me the most is that she told me that it wasn't the first time it happened before. She even showed me the bruise she got from their last argument.

It was also the first time that I have ever called the police in my life, and I felt grateful that they came. While we were waiting I could even see the guy circling around her car, expecting her to come back. After a few questions, they thanked me for calling and they ended up leaving. I'm not completely sure what the end result was. However, I did find out that they helped her back to her apartment, and went back to deal with the guy. I'm not sure what happened to him, but I did find out that she was going to be safe. Before she left, she tearfully thanked me.

I know it feels like I'm rambling, but I've never been in such a situation before. It was the first time that I have ever seen someone abused right in front of my eyes, and it wasn't a pleasant sight at all. I was honestly afraid to call the police, because I was afraid to get involved. Yet, I felt like it would have been far more horrible if I didn't do anything. I think about all the cases that don't get noticed, and I felt like it was my duty to intervene. 

I seriously just wanted to get this out to someone, and I thank you for reading all of this.  Two unpleasant things:

* You need to maintain good situational awareness now.  This guy might know where you live.  I guarantee he is angry at you.  People like this don't view the world like you or I - he may see your intervention as a challenge or an insult.  He might perceive your action as "making a move" on "his" girl and want to "teach you a lesson".  If there were significant consequences (or justice, as I see it) for him like criminal charges or the woman leaving him, he may blame you for it and want to punish you.

Please don't make the mistake of projecting *any* of your honor, morals, or sense of fairness onto him.  Think of him like an intelligent, dangerous animal - not a decent, brave guy like yourself.

So keep your head on a swivel.  Don't be on auto pilot when leaving or coming home.  Take a minute and observe.  Throw a small Mag-Lite into your back pocket - shine it into dark places like landscape bushes or your car's backseat at night.  Flashlights are great deterrents - the ambusher might associate them with police or security, and it's not always possible to see behind the bright light to identify the user.

Also, if he confronts you or comes within six feet, don't even talk - you smash that fucking Mag Lite into his xiphoid process, then shove it into his eyesocket, then run like hell, screaming for help.

* I strongly suggest you read up on what happens psychologically to people trapped in abusive relationships.  It's complicated.  You need to realize that her fear and/or love for this guy might well be the most powerful force in her life right now.  Unfortunately, you can't count on her to do the right thing by you.  For example, if some hypothetical situation develops and it's your word against the abuser's, that unfortunate woman might take the abuser's side.  She might even lie to law enforcement to the advantage of the abuser.  I have personally seen that happen, and I hope you act with that possibility in mind.  Don't let it deter you from acting as your conscience and sense of honor dictate, mind - but take necessary precautions.

And by the way - Nice Fucking Work.  You helped her, and you helped yourself.  You stepped the fuck up when it counted - stuffed your Fear and did what needed to be done.  What's more, you were efficient, effective, and smart about it.  You were tested and you passed.

 To add to your point about situational awareness, I would recommend not using headphones for a while. People listening to music rarely know what's going on around them. Two unpleasant things:

 &amp;gt; He might perceive your actions as "making a move" on "his" girl

That may be giving too much credit to the aggressor. He might perceive OP's actions as interrupting his dominance over his territory. He might rationalize it as "making a move on his girl", but deep down he's just mad that OP kept him from using violence to own someone.

For the abuser, it's not about the girl. It's about control. Two unpleasant things:

 Just want to add a little to what SavageHenry0311 is saying. Due to her Stockholm syndrome if the police decide they want to pursue this guy you may be the only witness willing to say anything. Good job though.  Two unpleasant things:

     Thank you for standing up for someone who is helpless so to speak.  I hate men (and women) who abuse other people, or children of omg animals. They are cowards. They have to take it out on someone who can't fight back. Pisses me off. But thank you again for being a good human being!! Thank you for the kind words! The whole event was so surreal! I feel that no one deserves to be abused at all. I now feel even more relieved that I did call the police, because there was nobody else around to witness it either!                         </snippet></document><document><title>I'm insecure about having my photo taken so I stick my tongue out.

I have a friend who is getting out of an 11 year marriage. She is doing remarkably well and if you didn't know her you would think she is just acting ok while dying on the inside or something else just as dramatic. She is a very decisive person, and knew that when her husband admitted to cheating on her (for the 3rd time in their relationship) that it was over and done.

She has full custody of her 4 children. They are 10, 9, 8, and 14 months. They are good kids but are all desperate for attention because of the way time is managed.

This is all back story so I can tell you this: she won't take her fucking face out of her phone. Ever. There are piles of filth, laundry everywhere, dishes rotting in the sink and she is texting with her crush. Currently I am in her living room, she is texting and flirting and her youngest woke up from her nap and is crying waiting for mom to come get her. This would be where I would get up, get the baby, change her, feed her, entertain her, then put her in the pack and play because I have to do dishes or get junk off the floor or something so that I can actually walk through the house without dying. On more than one occasion I have completely scrubbed down her whole kitchen so all she has to do is 'maintain' and a couple of days later I come back and things are just as bad. It's not just dishes either, things like opened cans of veggies, and whatever wrappers were opened to cook the previous nights meals. All mixed in with kids drawings and junk mail. It's gross and unhealthy. In order to clean something in the sink she clears mountains of stuff out of the sink and sets it all on the counter. My problem with it is that more often than not I end up being the mom, I get the older kids to do their chore, and their homework, I end up cooking dinner, I end up cleaning up after dinner, wash pots and pans, get the kids showered and put to bed, and she is still sitting there giggling like a school girl. 


On the nights where I let it go and don't do/say anything 1730 will roll around and something to the effect of "oh I should probably cook dinner, huh?" Will be jokingly said and then she will pop leftovers or box meals into the microwave. The kids will then be screamed at for not having finished their chores and homework. Then in a flurry of anger and attitude dinner will be hastily eaten then the kids will ignore everything she says cause they know if they wait a couple minutes she will forget that she told them to get into the shower and they will play until an hour after their official bed time when she will realize that they are up too late and they haven't done anything, cue more screaming and then a swift spanking before bed. Then she will stay up until past midnight on her phone flirting then wake up in the morning having done literally no housework the previous day wondering why her house is a fucking disaster. If someone comes over the kids get blamed for the mess, which while true for the most part, wouldn't happen if she paid attention and actually mothered them.

Oh! And I should also mention that she has this evil little chihuahua that will growl and snap at the 3 older kids if they get too close to her. It isn't properly house trained and will poop in the 9&amp;amp;7 year old's room all the time. They have learned to get toilet paper and pick up the poop and flush it in the toilet. Nothing more than that is done, no sanitization of the carpet or anything. 

I understand that when a relationship ends a person wants to move on. I really do get that. But I also think that your priorities have to be different when you are caring for children. 

The same things happen on nights when I am not there at all, so I know it's not just a passive thought of "oh she will just do it for me so no worries, I can count on her to do it" its pure fucking laziness and irresponsibility. 

The thing that breaks my heart the most though is that the 9 &amp;amp; 7 year old have each asked me individually if they can come live with me because my house isn't messy and doesn't smell bad "Even though your cats poop in a box inside the house!!!"  I know I have no official ties to the kids but I care for them and want them to be able to succeed, right now they do not have an environment to do that.


TL;DR: I feel like my only local friend is taking extreme advantage of me. She spends her time on her phone instead of caring for her children. I feel like if I'm not there the kids will live in a disgusting uncared for house.
  Sounds like she might need to see a professional about a mental health diagnosis - probably depression. Once she can get a jump-start with therapy and/or medication, she can concentrate on changing her behaviors.   Yup, this sounds like my mother at the beginning of her hoarding. My best guess is depression and anxiety, putting it off because it's stressful to deal with. Plus there's a study or two tying together OCD and hoarding. I can only see two choices, letting it go and trying to be an outside support; or sitting her down and telling her that she is ignoring her kids and the house, and it's disgusting and you cannot come over anymore. You may lose the friend over this. You also might be able to suggest support groups for divorcees in the area, or counseling. You can offer to take her kids to the park for a few hours each week while she works on the house. Nothing worked for my mom until she got remarried and her new husband put his foot down about new purchases and leaving wrappers everywhere. He cooks dinner every night and washes up, it has made the biggest difference. These suggestions are great. I'd like to add that it's also important to stress to her that her actions are seriously impacting her children who have expressed a desire to get out of that environment. She also has to keep in mind that teachers and other school officials will not hesitate to call CPS if one of her kids tells them about their filthy home situation.

Perhaps a maid isn't too far out of her budget? Just to help her get over the initial "holy hell this is too much work" feeling. But I'm definitely re-stressing the urge for mental health help. To me (through my personal lens) it sounds a lot like Love Addiction... her inability to function as a person without a man and dropping all other responsibilities in order to flirt with him on the phone are huge red flags. 

Either way she should definitely seek a therapist/counselor. Even if she doesn't think she needs it right now, it's important to get a mental checkup regularly. Especially with her recent big life changes... it's a good time for her to take stock. But you already knew that, it's all about trying to tell her that at this point.

They came from a very poor background so it's hard to get her to go unless she is in dire need. There isn't even a copayment with her insurance but she still makes a big deal out of going, old habits die hard I guess.  You cleaning her kitchen and going to take care of the baby isn't going to fix your friend's behavior problems. In fact, *nothing* will change your friend's behavior until she agrees that it *is* a problem, and then starts *working* to change. 

If she doesn't agree that her behavior is a problem, you have a couple of options.  

1. quit going over there,  
2. keep going over there, cleaning up after her, taking care of the kids, etc.  
3. call CPS and hope it scares some sense into her. Don't call CPS just to scare someone. There are kids lives at stake here. If they get removed from the household and sent to a foster home there's a chance they could be neglected just as badly if not worse. Don't call CPS unless you really believe the kids should not live with their mother, because in my personal experience the first thing CPS jumps to is removing children from the home.

EDIT: Apparently my experience with CPS was an outlier and they generally don't jump to foster care unless they absolutely feel they must. Still, don't use CPS to scare someone, call them because the children need help. Don't call CPS just to scare someone. There are kids lives at stake here.

Still, don't use CPS to scare someone, call them because the children need help. Truthfully, CPS' job is not to remove kids from homes willy-Nilly, and perpetuating such a myth is not helpful. CPS investigates and makes a case file, sure, but usually unless the kids aren't receiving a minimum standard of care (and look at Honey Boo Boo, that standard is pretty damn *low*), they aren't going to be removed from the home. 

The state is already taking care of plenty of abandoned children, sexually abused children, and starving children. Are they really going to take perfectly viable children on as a burden to taxpayers if they do not absolutely have to? I'm sick of cheap shots at Honey Boo Boo. What exactly is wrong with her situation? Her parents are going to kill her with that diet.  Who the fuck allows a little girl to consume gallons and gallons of Mountain Dew and Red Bull each week?  That much caffeine can be deadly.   Well from what I've seen, it's hardly gallons and gallons, more like a bottle or two, and it's just for pageants, not every single week. It's not really something worth taking a child away from their family for. She's fed, clothed, safe, loved...there are many children who miss out on that. Don't call CPS just to scare someone.

Especially with a 14 month old, their might be a post-partum depression component to this (in addition to her divorce).

In any case, it is not your responsibility to clean her house for her. She needs to figure out a way to cope with her new life. It seems like she is just using the conversations with her crush as a distraction from the more difficult or outright dismal aspects of hr life. I don't think I put enough strain in the op on how much she actually is on the phone. She is flirting with this dude nearly all day. She even takes the thing onto the toilet to talk to him... 

I honestly don't think it has anything to do with depression (I have been diagnosed since 2006). She has said "I know I'm a terrible house keeper" and other such things when talking to her other friends. From what I understand this has been a consistent problem since forever. Right now she is using the phone as an excuse to either ignore all parts of cleaning or taking a 45 sec break out of every minute to read/reply to her texts. She will stand in the kitchen next to a huge pile of dishes and text instead of loading the dish washer. Or instead of throwing the cans out while cooking she will just leave them on the counter next to the can opener. It's overwhelming, frustrating and exhausting for me. For me it's a choice of sitting at home alone with 'nothing to do' or going to her house and being overwhelmed by everything, neither is healthy for me.

* I actually have lots of things I could do but more often than not I get guilt tripped into going over... I feel guilty about the state of things for the older kids so I try to do everything I can to give them attention and make sure they stay on a rigid schedule.

Have you tried pointing these things out to her?.
 Yesterday, after dinner I had a bit of a melt down because of how gross things are. I told her that I can't handle it anymore and something needs to be done. She is doing some stuff but nothing has been done in the kitchen. Which is where the bulk of the work needs done... It's like she is nitpicking. Yes there is garbage on the laundry room floor, however having plates to eat dinner on seems more important... Or maybe that's just me. It probably feels overwhelming to her. Does she have anyone besides you? And are you taking good care of yourself? Yesterday, after dinner I had a bit of a melt down because of how gross things are.

It's like she is nitpicking. Yes there is garbage on the laundry room floor, however having plates to eat dinner on seems more important... Or maybe that's just me.  A woman I'm close to was in this exact situation about a year ago. She was going through a divorce and became completely engrossed in her new man. Her kids were neglected and her home was in shambles. The only things she paid any attention to we're her phone and working out so she could have a nice body for her re entry to the dating scene. I'm sorry to say that nothing improved until she married the man she was so preoccupied by and moved in with him. He sort of pushed her into keeping things tidy and is a foodie himself, so the kitchen stays pretty organized and alive. She was definitely not depressed, just.... Selfish. Too concerned with her own "new chance at life" to remember that her kids and her home were still a part of it. Our relationship is such that it would have been incredibly out of place for me to call her out, but as far as I can tell, that's the only thing that could have helped, and did help in the end.

If you feel like it's in any way your place to do so, I would encourage sitting down and talking to her about her situation. Be sure to be gentle, because this can be an extremely touchy subject, but ask to speak with her and then maybe go out to lunch or somewhere where you can be sure to have her full attention. Then tell her that you're concerned with how she is doing. Tell her that you've noticed that her house seems to be getting away from her and that she seems to be less focused on her family recently. Don't antagonize her. Tell her that you're worried about her and want to help, but can't take over her responsibilities. If she handles criticism well, bring up her kids and how she has been distracted from them. Basically, bring up your concerns, but always be sure not to turn her (or this new guy) into the enemy, and don't lose control of yourself during the conversation. You don't want this to turn into a fight so try to avoid offending her. Just make yourself heard.

Hopefully she can be brought back to her senses and will realize that she's in kind of a mess. If she can't, then you need to set boundaries and maybe move into the more drastic measures given in the rest of the thread. This is almost exactly how I feel... I can't find words to describe how frustrated I am at the end of the day. 

I have said things like "Jill, put down the phone and finish the dishes." Exactly those words, and she will go "oh yeah, I should probably get on that." In a ditzy loopy tone, not a depressed one. 

I will try to talk to her without distractions, but it seems like every time I bring it up it gets better for a day or two... Then back to normal. 

The best it's ever looked is when her family came to visit. And that was only due to me busting my ass.  Gah!

It is driving me INSANE! I have ruled out:

* new-tights smell

AAAAAAAAAAAGH

Anyone else have days like this? 

Edit: In case anyone's still interested in the weird-smell saga, I'm home and have completely disrobed, and smelled EVERY piece of clothing I was wearing all over (many weird looks from roommate). So far there is absolutely no culprit. The only options at this point are synesthesia, overactive imagination, or (most likely, IMHO) it's some combination of new-ish synthetic fabric, body heat and still air, which is why it was only noticeable when I was sitting at my desk (ruled out the desk chair). The weird smell anecdotes are great!    Sometimes when elastic gives out it can give off a really foul odor that doesn't disappear with washing.  How old are your panties? I've had some old beaters give way with a powerful stretch before the elastic started going to shreds. You know those long weird elastic thread things that can start pulling out of the waist line? (Maybe you don't know. Maybe you don't wear your panties until death do you part.) When those start showing up the stench may follow.  (I recall this happening frequently when I was a kid in the '80s and '90s. Doesn't happen as fast anymore. Materials may have improved.)      Do you have anything made of high performance material, like exercise clothes or bike shorts? Sometimes those can get a weird smell going on. Nope, normal stuff...ponte work dress and tights. Both are on the newish side, so that's a possible culprit, I suppose.               </snippet></document><document><title>How to deal with a man threatening to kill himself over his ex-girlfriend (my best friend)?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198qks/how_to_deal_with_a_man_threatening_to_kill/</url><snippet>My best friend is 19 years old and in college now. Her ex is 20 and will begin his service in the US Army in one week.

These two started dating when she was 14 years old, basically still a child. They had a middle-school type relationship for 9 months (going to movies together, holding hands, and kissing was about as serious as they got). They told each other that they loved each other about 5 months in, although obviously my friend knows now that it wasn't even remotely close to actual love that she felt. 

The guy has a troubled home life -- divorced parents who are very distant to him, nobody really close to him at all. I don't think there was any abuse but he definitely wasn't happy.

As they approached their ten-month anniversary, the guy kissed another girl. My friend dumped him, she was sad for a little bit, she moved on. He said he was sorry, tried to salvage the relationship, but was rejected. He left his parents and went to live with an aunt in another state. That was that, or so we thought.

Over the course of the last five years, this guy pops up every once in a while and starts texting my friend nonstop. He alludes that he wants her back, that he is so sorry for messing up, that she was the best thing that ever happened to him, etc. It got very creepy every time, especially as the two of them got older and older. Every time, she tells him she's sorry, that she has moved on, and that he needs to move on as well. He eventually gives up the texting and disappears for another few months, only to try again. 

The last time this happened, he started hinting that he was going to show up at her house and try to "win her back." Being essentially her sister, I was having NONE of that. I messaged him on Facebook and told him that if he got within 500 yards of her, he was going either to jail or to the hospital on my account. He never messaged me back, but he didn't message her again either.

Until tonight. He will not stop texting her. He is apparently very drunk. He is insisting he's still in love with her, that he needs her back, that he cannot live without her. Even though she's been in a committed relationship with someone else for almost two years now and wants nothing to do with him. 

Then he said "You better keep texting me back. Otherwise I'll probably kill someone. Or myself."

My friend is now terrified to turn him down in any way. She keeps texting him vague statements in order to keep him from hurting someone. We have no idea where he is, and there is no one we can contact to help him. He has also apparently been disowned by all of his family members and has no friends left. He is drunkenly rambling to her via text and is hinting that he's probably going to call her soon. Honestly, he's terrifying me, not to mention my friend. How on earth should she handle this?

**TL;DR Middle school relationship ended on a sour note five years ago. My friend's troubled ex has been creepily messaging her about being in love with her over the last five years and is now threatening to kill someone or himself if she stops talking to him. No idea where he is and have no one to contact to help him. Need advice for how my friend should handle this.**

Update: He is now telling her all about how he has masturbated to her for the last five years and how he wants her sexually. They never even went past kissing when they were together.   Call the police.  
Seriously.  
If this is just a cry for help, then he'll get the help he needs. If it's serious, then you are possibly saving a life.  
If he's just being a whiny bitch and trying to get attention, then it will teach him that suicide threats are **not** taken lightly.  Problem is, we don't know which police to call. He could be anywhere. Both my friend and I are two hours from our hometown, and there's no way to know if that's even where he is. </snippet></document><document><title>last night i learned that confidence is everything.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19584s/last_night_i_learned_that_confidence_is_everything/</url><snippet>i'm twenty five years old and i was in a relationship for four years until about a month ago. i have been trying to force myself to go out and meet new people. it isn't easy for me, usually i'm very shy and most of my boyfriends were already friends of mine first. it's really hard for me to meet new guys let alone talk to them (if i like them, i have no problem talking to dudes in a friendly manner). 

well last night i dressed really cute, put on a little make up, and decided that i was going to venture out of  my comfort zone, even if it just meant talking to someone new. i went to a party with a lot of people i knew but also a lot i didn't so i was feeling pretty good about the situation. if my plan failed, i could always hang out with my friends. i ended up noticing this really cute guy who was talking with some friends of mine. i walked over and we eventually got to talking; he just moved to the city and we had a long conversation about all the cool things to do in philly. i felt pretty good about myself, usually talking to someone so cute would be slightly intimidating to me but the conversation flowed easily and he was really nice.

later, we ended up going back to a mutual friends house with a few people to drink, smoke, and watch movies. after another beer and a hit of a blunt i worked up the courage to ask him to come smoke a cigarette with me. as we were smoking, i turned to him and said "i hope this isn't too forward, but i think you're really cute." he said, "it's not... i think that you're really cute too." so i smiled (still can't believe i did this!) and said "is it too forward to admit that i want to kiss you?" he stepped closer to me and said "i want to kiss you too". we kissed, and it was great. he was a really good kisser and i left shortly after with a smile on my face. 

the old me would have never had the balls to do that. i used to be so insecure and unsure of myself. in a way, i feel like i'm growing up. i'm not scared to say what i want and go for it both in life and in relationships. the old me would have wanted to kiss him, but just mentally talked myself out of it. i'm glad the new me was able to just go for it, because it turned out better than i could have ever imagined. 

he just texted me, asking if i could hang out today. maybe there really is something to the whole "confidence" thing. :)

TL;DR: a formerly shy girl decided to be more confident, went to a party, met a boy, and had an amazing night. confidence is power, as cheesy as that sounds.


edit: wow, the response to this has been amazing! i didn't expect so many people to see it (kind of hope the dude doesn't read reddit, ha). anyway, thanks for all the positive feedback! things have been going awesome, we actually hung out again last night and had a lot of fun. i'm proud of myself for taking a chance and luckily, things worked out in my favor this time. it's definitely a lot easier to feel confident when things are going your way but you have to just keep it up, even when you don't feel like it. fake it til you make it! to all the people out there who wish they could do something like this; i used to be like you but guess what? you can do this! just take a chance, if it doesn't work out, oh well but if it does then you'll realize that there is a whole world of opportunities you never took advantage of before. good luck everyone and thank you again! these are the kinds of posts that remind me why i love reddit. you guys rock!  Good for you! Though your post has made me think that I should be out talking to women rather than reading their subreddit... yes, definitely try to get yourself out there even if it's pushing your comfort zone a bit. you just have to think to yourself "what's the worst case scenario? they say no. big whoop." then you move on no harm, no foul. if you approach a woman with a sense of confidence and know how to start a good conversation then you're already half way there. if she doesn't shut you down, she's probably interested. there have been so many times i wish a guy would make a move because it was clear we were both interested. my new thing is just going for it, if the dude isn't into it, he'll let me know. &amp;gt;and know how to start a good conversation

Curses! Foiled again. How to start a good conversation : Hello  No that's just a greeting. Greetings are easy. 

Smalltalk is the hard part. And how to avoid making it sound like an interview/interrogation.  I seduced my girlfriend by talking about the concept of orbital colonies. Just go with what you enjoy! Dude stop bragging. Not everyone can naturally work orbital colonies into a conversation. 

Fuckin' Casanova.

Friends and Family
Occupation

Asking about any of those are a great way to start a conversation.  But it's so formulaic that I feel that I'm toeing the line between conversation and interview/interrogation.  No that's just a greeting. Greetings are easy.

Get it, girl! :)  AAAAAGH THAT IS SO AWESOME.

Seriously, you go girl! That must have felt incredible. You should be so proud of yourself! There's nothing better than saying how you feel and what you want and having it go so well. This is not the last time you'll have this experience and you'll also find that the more you do this, the less it'll bother you the times it doesn't go as you'd hoped.   That's awesome! Well done! Also the more you act confident, the easier it gets. I've learnt that the more you stay inside your comfort zone, the smaller it becomes so keep being a badass and you'll find that life is more fun and easier to cope with.  This exact same change in attitude (as a guy) compleltly changed me. Its unbelievable how easy it is, yet for some reason I was so afraid of it.


Turns out: it really is easy, and it really pays off.


YAY, CONFIDENCE!  There's only one part of that story that threw me. It reminded me of a Betty White quote:

&amp;gt; &#8220;Why do people say "grow some balls"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding.&#8221;

You're tougher than you think. :)  that wonderful and totally not cheesy! what i needa do is save this so next time i tell others how this works they can just see! when u want something in life u gotta get up and look for it. and i think more women out there have what it takes then they realize! you just gotta take a chance when you want something. it could lead to nothing or it could change your whole life. not just with romantic relationships but with every aspect of life.   I did something 'grown up' like that about two years ago.  (One year ago?  Gods time is flying, i don't know)  Anyway, met a guy off of a dating site and started hanging out with him after months of talking on the internet.  We got along really great, though I knew he was a little standoffish about dating anyone.  Several weeks go by and I tell him that while I understand he's not into it, I wanted to let him know I was starting to like him and that the ball was in his court if he ever wanted to do anything about it.

Never heard from him again.

Talk about a blow to my confidence.  On the plus side, I got the Pathfinder players handbook and DM guide, as well as a novel as his that i'm keeping as 'tax' for being a frakking prick.  *shrug*   I did something 'grown up' like that about two years ago.

True.  I've given up for now though, since I have no idea where i'll be living in 6 months and don't feel like getting into it here.  My school schedule doesn't allow for it anyway.  College is over in May.  That's all that matters.  Well, and staying sane till then.  you could always just have fun now. go out to new bars or clubs if dancing is your thing. hang out with new people but don't make it too serious. maybe you'll get a couple of steamy makeout seshes out of it if you're lucky. endless possibilities.. plus it could help you blow off some stress from school. That's really not my thing.  I don't do the random makeout sessions anymore, or clubs, or any of that.  It all seems very silly and pointless to me.  Also at my weight there's no real point in trying.  It's best to just finish school, lose weight, and then worry about it.

Guess i'm a serious person when it comes to that.   yeah i mean i personally don't do clubs either, i go see bands play but whatever your thing is. i don't know you as a person but i can tell you that the person above me is right, time is passing by and you aren't fully living your life. if you are unhappy with your weight, take some initiative and join a gym or do work out videos on youtube. but  just because you are a little bigger does not make you unattractive or undesirable to men. lots of men love curvy women. hell, i wish i was curvier because i'm straight as a bored and used to be convinced that no man wanted to fuck me because of my lack of curves. put on a hot dress that shows off your best assets and go out and do something you like to do, maybe with another girl so you can have a wingman. it doesn't have to be about a one night stand, you could end up meeting new friends or a potential bf. you'll never know if you don't try. whatever you do, stop living for the future and start living in the now. you can do it! It's not a 'little' overweight. (I'm 250lbs and 5'6")

No, i am bound by area, opportunity, etc.  I live in a little hick town with nothing to do.  I have no friends here.  I also have no time because i'm doing school 40 hours a week not including studying and homework.  Closest places to go are an hour away and in my truck it just never seems worth the gas.  Things I like to do are too nerdy for this area really, and what little nerdy I can find doesn't fit my schedule. 

I'm living life in terms of trying to finish school.  Which thus far in my life has had three other failed tries.  I would hate to frak it up by finding a boyfriend, or spending my time out of the house too much to get anything done.  It's bad enough I Reddit =/    I'm basically waiting till I can move to a better place.  Which should be a possibility around July/August.   this model is 5'7 and 200lbs. she is beautiful.

as far as your situation goes, that sucks and i'm sorry. hopefully when you move you can find activities and people that you enjoy spending time with. add 50lbs to her belly and take away the photoshop smoothing and that's about my build.  Also much saggier boobs.  Because gravity.  

I have friends in the Chicago area that are offering to let me move in with them.  I don't know if i can find a job in their area or how expensive it will be to move my stuff up there but i'm seriously considering it.  They have several veterinary practices within 20 minutes of them i could apply to at least.   I'm really happy for you! Reading that made me smile, and gives me hope that shy little me could work myself up to that level too! :) you can! sike yourself up when you're getting ready. listen to music that makes you feel good. pick out an outfit that shows all your best qualities. stay positive throughout the night. instead of thinking "no one is talking to me, i'm never going to meet someone" find a reason to approach someone. smoker? ask for a light. not a smoker? comment on the weather/food/music/people/etc. at the place you are at. you'd be surprised where one comment can take you.

To hear an anecdote from a strong, beautiful woman who took a situation into her own hands and got what she wanted is--honestly, I want you to know this--deeply, permanently inspiring and encouraging to me. You have changed the way I think about situations like this. You are AWESOME!!!  that's how I met my husband, girlfriend! I first saw him reading in the engineering library, looking all shy and quiet, but super hot. Out of the blue, I had this crazy surge of courage and hit on him right then and there. He was so excited about it, we started dating immediately.

Go forward brave one!   Go 'head, girl, get yours! I'm 30 and still can't do this. Next time I find myself in a similar situation, I'll take a page from your book, I'm inspired.     wow this is so empowering for me! I a 19 , and very shy about talking to guys I like... maybe one day I can be like you ! :P you can! just feel good about yourself! in all reality thought i remember being 19 and i was way more shy than i am now and self conscious. now that i'm 25 and getting older i WISH i looked like i did when i was 19 again. i wish i took more chances back then but my insecurity held me back. don't be like me, go out and put yourself out there otherwise you may regret it.                   Yeah you got out of your comfort zone by smoking pot. Kudos! it was one hit, it just made me slightly less anxious. 

on another note my friend becky snorted pot in high school and she died. please do not use such a dangerous drug as you don't want to end up like my friend. pot is a deadly and addictive drug that destroys lives *~rip becky~* Hey, I'm just letting you know that I'm with you, but please don't bring the "my friend died from one marijuana" thing on here. It's not relevant.      To all the haters, this post is identical to the majority of those on /r/seduction. Except OP didn't rate his looks on a scale of 1-10, didn't do any of those stupid techniques used to "trick" people into liking you and didn't casually give backhanded insults to the guy she was pursuing. 

She asked a guy to stand outside with her and they confessed mutual attraction.  Confidence and communicating what you want are far larger parts of /r/seduction than negs, which seem to always be the main point of criticism even though they're largely shunned in the community. The rating of women and the intentional touching not because you want to but because it's supposed to be some kind of gateway to getting laid or whatever really bugs the shit out of me. PUA's can be spotted a mile away and all of the "techniques" used in /r/seduction creeps me right the fuck out. 
 I agree that the rating is pretty objectifying, I think it's mainly used to denominate people in the field reports, but yes the community would be far better off without it.

Again, you're just intentionally misunderstanding the touching thing ("kino"). It's never encouraged in a forceful way, but rather in the context of normal social interaction as a one to indicate interest. It's better than a guy hanging out with you, seeming like he's just being friendly, and expressing interest too late ie when you feel it's just platonic. I don't think I am intentionally misunderstanding anything. That kino crap is sleazy. You shouldn't have to touch someone to let them know you're interested.     Seems like should be X/posted to seduction. The boys needs these up lifting stories. Really. Seems like should be X/posted to seduction. The boys needs these up lifting stories. Really. </snippet></document><document><title>I need to vent about a "friend"</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1985rv/i_need_to_vent_about_a_friend/</url><snippet>Hi girls,

This is my first time posting here.  I need to rant.

There's this girl that I go to school with that I have been very good friends with for the past 2.5 years.  We both agreed that we would be roommates next semester.  A week later, she texts me and tells me that before she agreed to live with me, she told the girl she was living with last semester that if this girl was going to be back on campus this semester she would live with her.  Well, this girl decides she is going to live on campus, so she tells me she's going to room with her, but we can still try to find a 4 person room.  I was a little upset, but whatever, I got over it.  About a week ago, she texted me and told me that we now have 5 people, so we were going to try to get a 6 person room.  Everything up to this point is fine.  Today, she texts me and tells me that I have to find somewhere else to live, because the 4 of them want a 4 person room stead of a 6.  WTF???  I'm not upset over the fact that I'll have to find another group of girls to live with, it's just that my "good friend" dumped me on my ass.  

Ugh, /rant.  I'm predicting that pretty soon you'll be thanking your lucky stars that you missed out on rooming with such a flake.    </snippet></document><document><title>Just a TA vent</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198mzx/just_a_ta_vent/</url><snippet>I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I just need to vent about a student I have in my Soc 101 course that I TA for. This kid just writes the most absolute racist and misogynistic things possible. He constantly cites himself. That is how arrogant he is. I feel like I'm stuck, because I can't correct him, even though there are numerous studies showing beliefs are unfounded. The professor is just a lecturer and the university is cutting 1/8 of the lecturers, so she wants the class to have a high average. She also warned me to only write positive comments because these students are likely to drop the course. I just feel like it is my job to correct him and let him know that he is entitled to his beliefs but there is substantial evidence suggesting that he is wrong on about 90% of everything he says. I just needed to let it out for a second, I know my job is a TA and I shouldn't be so stressed about this and just give his grade and not give it a second thought but it really really bugs me. 
Thanks for listening.  </snippet></document><document><title>emotional abuse? scared and sad and need to vent, and hear your experiences.. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197jyw/emotional_abuse_scared_and_sad_and_need_to_vent/</url><snippet>Throw away.  I'm sorry this is so long.  It's 2:54 pm and I have been crying since 8:00 this morning, my head is pounding and I feel like things are starting to spiral out of control.  

My husband and I have been married for less than 10 years, but more than a couple.  I'm in my late 20s and he's about a decade older.  We have two young boys together, I have another young child from a previous relationship, and he has a teenager from a previous relationship.  We live together.  My husband has some anger issues, and issues understanding emotion/other people.  He is a very smart guy, he can fix a car, computer, anything electronic, build a house.. he just doesn't get people very well.  I've looked past this as much as possible because I really love him and he had a rough childhood (no father, indifferent stepfather, alcoholic problems with multiple family members) and I feel he may be on the autism spectrum (possibly aspergers).  We do have an almost 4 year old with autism so we've done plenty of research on this and recognized some of the symptoms in my husband a few years ago.

We've been having a really hard time, especially lately, but on and off all through our marriage.  He screams at me, threatens to hit me/smack me/put a boot up my ass, and gets in my face even when I ask him to please back away because he is scaring me.  This morning I was trying to get the younger two ready for school.  Our autistic son was crying, which admittedly he does a lot and it is REALLY HARD to deal with.  It is.  My husband was sitting there and he just snapped at me, "This is why I keep getting mad at you, you don't care, you know I can't handle crying and you don't care, you take your time getting him ready and don't care about me".  He was upset because it was taking me too long to get our son bundled up and out the door.  I realize he hates the crying.  I do too, I'm the one that gets our son ready for stuff, brings him to school, etc and sometimes he cries the whole time.  I hate it too, but all I can try to do is get him ready, comfort him, and get out the door.  I can't stuff a sock in his mouth.  I also have the other young school age kid to get ready too, and he has some issues as well, so some mornings I am in tears as it is.  Rather than walk away, or help with the kids, my husband screams at me for "letting the kids cry."  He told me this morning if I didn't start caring about him, he would put a boot up my ass and divorce me.  I told him no one likes the crying and I was sorry but I cannot focus on making him and a small disabled child happy at the same time, and he started screaming more, then advanced towards me.  I shrunk away and asked him to please back off, at which point he started mocking me for being scared of him, because he has never hit me.  It's true he has not hit me, but lately every time he blows up he threatens to, so I feel like any time could be the time he snaps and does it, and even without the threats what person wants another angry person screaming 2 inches from their face?

Last week the kids were running around in the morning before school, I was trying to calm them down when he came upstairs and started screaming and stomping his feet, saying that's how loud it sounds in the basement.. he stomped his foot so hard he fractured his heel and had to go get xrays and crutches.  He says it's my fault for not preventing the kids from running around and again blamed me for not caring about him.  I was trying to quiet them down because I knew it would any second he came upstairs pissed off, but.. it's hard having 3 little kids and two being special needs and trying to get them all ready in the morning and keep them quiet.  I feel like it is hard enough to manage the kids and keep my sanity, but also worry about constantly keeping them from bothering my husband or he will blow up and then they see him screaming at me and threatening me.  And I don't feel like that's right.  Am I wrong for thinking that as a nearly 40 year old man, he should either help me get the kids under control, or at least ignore it/walk away, but NOT blow up at me especially with them watching.  

He is not interested in counseling. I was just approved for medicaid and when it takes effect March first I will call and try to get set up with a therapist for myself asap.  I have talked to his sister about this many times, and she tells me he was like this in his previous relationships and that he will not change.. he is almost 40.  She loves him, but encourages me to leave.  I am scared though.  Scared because I love him, my boys love him, and I don't know what will happen.  We have a mortgage and one vehicle we share.  He works, I have been off work since 2011 because the combination of working, taking care of the home and special needs children was exhausting me and I began having bad anxiety attacks.  (Before my kids I worked full time in a supervisor position.)  One of my sons gets SSI, and I may be getting a small amount of child support for the oldest one soon, but it would not be enough to survive on my own with the kids.  Even if we divorced and I got the house, I don't have an income and I don't know how to balance work with all of my children's needs, therapy, school, and appointments on my own.  With my husband working it is already super challenging to keep up with it all.  I'm scared of having anxiety attacks again, I feel on the verge of just giving up everything but I am holding it together because my kids need me and I refuse to let them down.  So it's not like I can just walk away, my kids need to be in school and therapy and get to their appointments.  I also feel so much shame for having possibly failed to make it work with two different men that I have had kids with.  I worry so much about what others think of me, and struggle to get past it.  Has anyone been in my situation.. what did you do, what happened?  How did you make it?  I'm so scared of what will happen to me and my kids.  

If my husband isn't willing to attend therapy or try and work on his anger issues, I feel like the best thing is to split up because I do not want my three little boys seeing him treat me like this.  Even if he doesn't hit me, I don't want them seeing it.  I suggested he try and find a solution to his anger issues, and he said there is none and I need to deal with it, and make it stop by preventing the kids from upsetting him.  I don't see that as a realistic solution especially having two kids with a lot of challenges.  I know I would tell someone else in my spot to get out.  I am just so terrified and I love my husband and I just wish he would try to change.  I am NOT without fault by any means, I have anxiety issues and have battled depression for a few years, but I am trying to hold it together and I will be the first to apologize and try to come to a compromise when issues arise.

Just curious what you ladies are thinking. 

I personally wasn't offended because to me being offended means that you think there's something wrong with these women opting to do nudity in the first place. The only actress I could see having a problem with the whole thing was maybe ScarJo because he did reference those leaked pictures of hers which was sort of uncool. 

But that was just my gut reaction. Would be curious to hear thoughts on either side. Anyone?  Out of all the stupid shit he said last night, the boob song was the least offensive. 

How about the "jokes" about all the women having eating disorders or sexualizing a nine year old girl? Where is the outrage over that? 
    I found the the fact that four of the moments he was referring to were rape scenes pretty distasteful.   This might not be (or might be, I have no idea) a popular opinion here, but I thought it was funny. I think boobs are fun and the song was juvenile but entertaining. And I agree that I am not offended by actresses that chose to display their goods because I don't think breasts need to be inherently sexual, forbidden things. I think of something like this song that acknowledges that "hey, women do have breasts and some people consider that taboo but let's relax a little" can be compared to the Janet Jackson super bowl craziness when it was like "OMG A NIPPLE THE WORLD IS ENDING" and this seems much more rational and fun.

Also, in the tradition of Oscar night, the song makes fun of one of the big Hollywood cliches that win Oscars. Some are more politically correct than others (playing ugly vs. playing someone with a mental handicap) so boobs seems to be a harmless thing to sing about for me.

Now, in the grand scheme of things, this does bring up a lot of questions about the portrayal of sex and sexuality in Hollywood. Why are boobs thought to be so risque? Why not have a song about seeing guy's junk?  I think is a huge problem with Hollywood itself (see "This Film is Not Yet Rates") and the song pokes fun at that. I also thought is was funny, but I also have the mind of a 16 year old boy not a 30 year old professional woman (Yep that's who I really am).... I love all of the Seth McFarland "family guy", "south park", etc. type comedy, that what the song reminded me of.    I found it pretty tasteless. I don't think it implied that there's anything wrong with women doing nudity in film, but I felt it downplayed their fantastic talents and pushed the focus on their value as eye-candy instead. I don't think you'd be likely to see an equivalent song directed at the male actors. 

Probably at least part of that impression came from the fact that I just didn't find it funny. "I'm here to stop you from doing something really offensive you were gonna do in the future, but we're going to show the full-length thing anyway so you can make a raunchy joke without really owning up to it!" If the song or its presentation had actually been funny to me, I probably would have found it less distasteful. 

Furthermore, some of the other jokes (women getting the "flu" before the show, women can hold grudges forever, it's fine nobody can understand Hayek because she's hot) only increased my annoyance with the boob song. 

edited for grammar, yay running on 3 hours sleep! I definitely was bugged by the women getting the flu, women hold grudges, etc. jokes ... I think he said a lot of things that were offensive, the boobs song just wasn't one of them for me. But I can see how if you look at it as a part of the whole, it's more bothersome.           </snippet></document><document><title>Going on a date to an alternative-rock concert, outfit recommendations?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198krz/going_on_a_date_to_an_alternativerock_concert/</url><snippet>I was invited by a guy friend who I have a crush on (yay!) but I'm not sure what to wear to this Muse concert (alternative-rock genre). Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, I haven't been on a date in so long and I'm really excited! :-)  i would wear jeans, boots (cute but comfortable enough to stand in), a cute top (not a tshirt) with a jacket (i have a black leather one that i love). if you have a small purse, i'd recommend bringing that-- big bulky ones can get really annoying to hold onto all night. have fun! I'll start by saying I'm jealous, if you get Band of Skulls opening for them you're in for a real treat! Orangesqueege's pretty much bang on. I wore something like that too but my leather jacket was red. :D 

I'd recommend a small cross-body strap purse you can zip up under your jacket to secure it or throw things in pockets with zips.  </snippet></document><document><title>Need advice from married (&amp;amp; etc) women</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197ayo/need_advice_from_married_etc_women/</url><snippet>I'm the female who works with your boyfriend/husband/partner. 
We grab coffee, go out for drinks or just quietly work on individual projects in the midst of the other's company. 
You and I, however, are not friends. We've 'Nice to meet you' and 'Hi, how are you?' but we rarely see each other. You know that your _______ and I hang out but do you know how often?
Do you care? Are you bothered by our close friendship or are pleased that your h/bf/sig. other has some company? 
I want to be on the same team as other women but sometimes I feel as if I'm treading in a gray area.
Please help me avoid any discomfort and conflict.  

Thanks 2x  If you are respectful of the relationship and boundaries it's fine. Meaning, no bad mouthing the girlfriend, no constant texting, and no flirting/excessive touching. And none of that "oh I'm a naturally flirty person I can't help it~~~" nonsense. Invite the gf along sometimes, even if you know she can't come. It's polite to extend the invitation anyways.

If you are feeling like you are in a gray area, you should probably back off a little. If you are respectful of the relationship and boundaries it's fine.

If you are feeling like you are in a gray area, you should probably back off a little.  If you want to be on the same team, then you invite the SO to these drinks and coffee, unless they are strictly work related (and thus involve additional people from the office). You are excited to get to know her, and spend time with both of them. 

If you find that you don't care to be friends with her, or don't want to see them together, you might have some feelings toward him that you need to figure out on your own.

Personally, I am thrilled to meet my friends' SOs, because at our age, this is usually a very important person who is likely to be around for a significant amount of time. I also like meeting my SO's female friends - and I am invited frequently to join them, but am also quite happy to decline invitations and allow them their friendship.   I have a long-term partner, and this would be a definite gray area for me. If one-on-one meetings for drinks and coffee were regular, I wouldn't be okay with it. I'm not a very jealous person and I wholly trust my partner, but I would wonder why there was so much one-on-one time, and why it was happening so consistently. I'd like to think my partner would reserve most of that time for me, not a work friend (regardless of gender). If he was spending time after work getting drinks with a friend, when we could be spending time together at home and having dinner, I would be a bit irked. 

I'd much prefer to join the pair of you if you were spending time together. I think knowing you would help alleviate any worry on my part. Hope this helps a bit!



 Really? I like the fact that my bf has a life outside the home. His own friends and interest. It means he's got stories to tell. Don't you crave one-one time with other people?    &amp;gt;Don't you crave one-one time with other people? 

I actually don't at all and my partner is the same. We consider each other best friends and have the same interests. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. But we prefer spending time with our group of friends together.  Really? I like the fact that my bf has a life outside the home. His own friends and interest. It means he's got stories to tell. Don't you crave one-one time with other people?    I have a long-term partner, and this would be a definite gray area for me. If one-on-one meetings for drinks and coffee were regular, I wouldn't be okay with it. I'm not a very jealous person and I wholly trust my partner, but I would wonder why there was so much one-on-one time, and why it was happening so consistently. I'd like to think my partner would reserve most of that time for me, not a work friend (regardless of gender). If he was spending time after work getting drinks with a friend, when we could be spending time together at home and having dinner, I would be a bit irked. 

I'd much prefer to join the pair of you if you were spending time together. I think knowing you would help alleviate any worry on my part. Hope this helps a bit!



  This honestly doesn't bother me.  I trust my husband with other women.  There have been times, however, he's gone into dumbass territory with a woman he worked with (had her, someone I didn't know from Adam, pick out an anniversary ring for me).  I told him I didn't like it and it stopped.

I think coffee is one thing, lunch is one thing, doing work things is one thing.  Drinks after work are another thing.  Alcohol can deaden people's inhibitions and while not solely responsible for people's stupid actions, it can definitely influence how a person responds in a given situation.

If you want to be on "Team Woman" my suggestions are to not put yourself into "grey area" situations with other women's husbands and I think going out for drinks is one of those grey areas you should avoid. If it seems like HE is enamored with your company and you are spending more than work time with him, be the one to put distance between the both of you.   HE is definitely responsible for himself and his actions, however, he may not be the voice of reason in your strictly work "friendship" so you may have to be.

Also, at work parties, make an extra effort to introduce yourself and perhaps even befriend the guys spouse in a genuine manner.  Basically don't be the person you wouldn't want YOUR SO around.  Not making any assumptions here at all... but it's amazing what people will interpret as flirtation (simple kindness these days seems to be taken as such).    Hello lady who collaborates with my husband. He and I are happily married, and trust each other to enjoy platonic friendships and professional relationships with members of the opposite sex. I, being secure in my position in his life, would love to meet you sometime. If he mentions you enough, I'd tell him, "Why don't you invite her over for dinner with us? You can cook something tasty, and I'll open up a good bottle of vino. I hope she's not allergic to cats."

If you accept our offer of dinner, I'll do my best to acquaint myself with you. I'm really gregarious, and I like meeting new people. I'd also love it if you invited me along for any group functions. If you're all going out to happy hour, I would like to come along and meet the gang. 

But in the event you or he does anything to set off my Spidey-Sense, I will investigate reasonable suspicions to the fullest extent.         Look, my husband is an adult and he is capable of managing himself.  I don't care. So you're saying that you honestly wouldn't care, even a little bit, if your husband decided it was okay to go out for drinks after work every night with his attractive female co-worker? I'm bisexual.  Should I never go out with any person ever?  I'm monogamous, he's monogamous.  If I didn't trust him, he wouldn't wear my ring.        As the wife? You have no reason to be going out to coffee/drinks/etc with my husband without me. Not only is it that grey area you talked about, it's just plain socially incorrect- unless you are close friends with only one person, it's rude to invite one half of a social unit and not the other. 

If you are doing the coffee/drinks as a work thing, then everyone in the office should be invited. There's no reason for you to be spending time alone outside of work.

Obviously everyone's comfort zones are different, but that's mine for whatever its worth.

*Editing to add my husband is the IT/marketing guy, so that colors my views on this a bit as well. He has no reason to be hanging out with the receptionists after work. It may be different when co-workers are more on the same 'team' or level, but that's not something that happens at my own job either.  This is a throw-away account.     </snippet></document><document><title>Too much negativity on this subreddit - lets put together a post of positive things!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197n5h/too_much_negativity_on_this_subreddit_lets_put/</url><snippet>Hello!

I've noticed that since I subscribed (about 2 months ago) that this subreddit has a LOT of negative posts. I understand that a lot of those posts are people asking for help with life and problems.

However, I think it might be a good idea to just write here some positive things that happened to you in the last week. 

Mine are:
I'm a photographer and I had a client tell me they loved my photos, that I'm awesome and they love the sneak peek I posted on Facebook for them!

I am also a dance teacher and one of my students thanked me tonight for my patience and complimented me on my knowledge and teaching skills. :)

Feeling good, so I want to spread the love! :)          My hair is purple and I got to do children's focus at church yesterday. It really inspired me to do more in my community and in my own mind :)  </snippet></document><document><title>How do you deal with sexism at work?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198jaq/how_do_you_deal_with_sexism_at_work/</url><snippet>The manager at the restaurant I work at walked up to me and the only other female working the shift, talking about his friend who was going through issues.

I never feel like I'm part of the "tech" community or anything, but I've been trying to get over that. I've known I've had impostor syndrome for awhile but I've never really been sure what to do about it. It's like I play four instruments (and have for years now) but only recently started referring to myself as a musician. I feel like this could be pretty common among people starting out in college or in a certain field, but I could be wrong. I think it is.  One suggestion I have for you is to mentor someone else.  Helping someone else has a couple of results.

1.  You feel good because you helped.
2.  You realize that you know stuff which other people might not know.
3.  Teaching / showing someone how to do something makes you think about things in a different way.  You actually get better at it as a result.

You only have to know one thing more than someone else to mentor them. I think it is.  One suggestion I have for you is to mentor someone else.  Helping someone else has a couple of results.

You only have to know one thing more than someone else to mentor them. I didn't realize how far I'd come until an intern came to me with a question and I debugged the problem he'd been stumped on for an hour in about 2 minutes. I definitely agree with the mentoring.  I'm a biologist and this is definitely common in science grad school. I feel like PhD programs are designed to force people to second-guess themselves. It's an important part of being a scientist (I.e. constantly questioning, testing, never trusting your instincts, only trusting the data,) but it can be extremely difficult too. A lot of students have stress issues because they never feel like they're performing adequately, never realizing that everybody feels that way.  That's what drove me crazy when I was doing research in biology. You're constantly messing up or not understanding something and end up feeling like you shouldn't be there. It's nice to know that other people feel the same.   I just started my PhD in physics. I feel like I am the opposite. The people with imposter syndrome see me and worry that they are like me. I am the dummy that everyone looks at and says "Oh man, what if I am like wellgrounded?! What if I suck at everything and no one is telling me!"

argh. I feel better now! It's physics - everyone is thinking they're the one that doesn't have impostor syndrome. Find a professor that will help you through the rough spots - my husband tried the whole physics grad school thing last year and decided it wasn't for him (he got a sweet industry job), but I have to say, I'm in a PhD program, and if it were as awful as physics was... Find someone who's willing to help you get through it, because that's really all you can do.

It doesn't take the edge off to point out the obvious, but people who speak cruelly with no regard for the feelings of others are truly miserable. 

I read something a while ago that explained, in a situation such as this, we should be able to recognize that the ugly has nothing to do with us, and everything to do with that person's relationship with themselves. Anyone who would say such a thing must have one of those 'it's complicated' things going on. Either that, or straight up divorced.

However, my instinct is always to smack a bitch like this. I obviously have much evolving, myself, to do.  i just can't understand why people belittle others to make themselves feel better. how DOES that make you feel better?! It doesn't. Not really. However, it is true that humans operate on wavelengths, so I suppose there could be something to the theory of energy sapping. As in, by cruelly disturbing the frequency of another, you absorb some of their energy. If this is a viable line of reasoning, it can also be said that by 'bolstering' another's energy level, they will exude that positive energy, thereby replacing any of your energy it took to be kind in the first place. A much more efficient and sustainable form of energy consumption, really.      </snippet></document><document><title>Hey men who frequent TwoX- Why?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/195yql/hey_men_who_frequent_twox_why/</url><snippet>I'm really interested in the perspective of men who hang out here. I know I see comments etc. from guys here sometimes. What is it that you get out of reading and participating here that you don't get in the rest of Reddit?  I'm 43 and have been married for nearly 20 years. Not only can I occasionally come up with a (supposedly) wise set of comments replies for the younger ladies, but I also can understand the female mind and experiences better, thus allowing my marriage to be better.

One thing which astounded me was that comment thread about a year ago which dealt with the issue of unwanted advances. The fact that virtually every woman has to deal with unwanted advances was new to me and when I spoke to my wife about it she confirmed this. It helped me to understand the amount of fear and uncertainty and powerlessness that some women may have felt in their lives.  Reddit is overwhelmingly male and everywhere you go on the site is men's opinion on stuff, so a lot of the reason I come here to browse is to get women's perspectives on things. I am interested in all the discussion of gender related issues. Also I find the TwoX community to be very pleasant and welcoming, often more so than the rest of Reddit.

Of course, I also simply find women interesting. I often wonder if men's opinions really do dominate most of reddit, or whether people just assume that most commenters are men. I'm a woman, but people almost always address me as dude, man, bro, sir, etc. Everyone almost immediately assumes that I'm a man when I don't make it clear in my comment that I'm a woman.

So perhaps many women do offer their opinion on reddit, but these are unable to reflect the women's perspective, because people just assume they're men. Perhaps. According to Google's Ad Planner Estimate, Reddit's user base is about 72% male.  Various surveys - like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gzb2w/i_made_a_basic_reddit_demographic_survey_lets/) - put the number even higher. And I'll bet, of most of the people who actually comment, it's an even higher percentage of males. According to Google's Ad Planner Estimate, Reddit's user base is about 72% male.  Various surveys - like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gzb2w/i_made_a_basic_reddit_demographic_survey_lets/) - put the number even higher. I see. Thanks for the info.

So perhaps many women do offer their opinion on reddit, but these are unable to reflect the women's perspective, because people just assume they're men. Perhaps. For the past few months, I have been tagging TwoX users who have presented themselves as men, just out of curiosity. Even here, the conversation is male-dominated :(

Edit: I don't mean that in sheer number of users (this sub probably has more female than male subscribers) but in terms of loudness. Male TwoX users tend to post disproportionately more, even on topics where they have no personal experience, when they get into debates they tend to post and post until the other party gives up, they are often upvoted to the top of the conversation (...by other men?) It's not a rare occurrence for the top 5 or 6 posts of a TwoX thread to be exclusively written by men talking to one another. I understand that the moderation choice here is to let men post as freely as they want, but personally I find it bordering on absurd to be spoken over so much in a supposedly female sub.

As a straight guy who's not very interested in women, I occasionally visit 2X to gain a broader perspective of everyday issues that affect normal people. It also helps to keep me in check as a man because I would not be aware of some of the more gender specific issues present in society if it weren't for 2X and some other female centric 'newspapers' and blogs. Just out of curiosity, what kind of "interested" are you talking about when you say you're not very interested in women? Imagine a little boy that loves to play with his toys and other things that little boys do. The one that's indifferent to the discrepancies between boys and girls, and just goes about his day doing what he likes because he's off in a fantasy land much of the time.

While most other guys eventually started to notice girls and treat them differently, I never grew out of being that little kid that didn't care. I thought that this was a perfectly fine way to exist (no one bullied me for not liking girls), so I didn't think about it for most of my teenage years. 

After a while, I realised that I would have to become someone that my younger, teenaged sister could seek help from (my father was constantly away and my mother was extremely old fashioned and overbearing), I began to educate myself on women's issues in order to be prepared to help my sister if she ever needed it, as she's the stereotypical 'hot chick' type that probably wouldn't speak to her friends or teachers about certain topics, on top of the reasons mentioned above.

As for the "heterosexuality includes interest in women' discussion, I have to say that though I do find women sexually attractive, I quite dislike being touched. Too many good conversations have been ruined because women would not stop touching my arm or leg, resulting in me making some excuse to get away. Bearing this in mind, I think it's doubtful that I'd ever actually have sex, let alone a relationship, with a woman despite being heterosexual. Another way to look at this is the fact that men do not arouse me, women do. Yet I would not enter a relationship with either.

 I'm going to second what another person said.

You sound like you might be asexual to me, too, most likely falling into the incredibly broad category of a gray A, like I do.  You might want to go do some reading and see if it fits, finding out there was a word for what I was, and that there were other people like me, did a hell of a lot of good for my state of mind.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a PM.
 I did some reading and I've found these two describe me pretty well:

-Experience sexual attraction and drive, but not strongly enough to want to act on them (dislike of being touched &amp;gt; attraction and drive)

-Experience romantic attraction, but not desire romantic relationships (I cannot stand the idea of 'being loved')

I find it funny that a post on reddit could cause me to question my sexuality. This will probably change things.

It's been an interesting day.

 I'm not too well versed in it, since we only spoke briefly about it in class but have you looked into asexuality? It's a sexual preference just like the others except it's people that don't prefer sex with anyone. Perfectly normal. Some people just aren't interested in that facet of life. Or they prefer masturbation to having an encounter with someone.  You sound like you're doubting his own definition of his sexuality. There's nothing wrong with defining himself as heterosexual, if that's how he feels. He is attracted to women. Sexuality is a personal thing, and people define it differently.  That's not what I meant. It's just that some people have been told that sexuality is only hetero, bi and homo. And that simply isn't true. Most people also don't know that there is a sliding scale and most people aren't ONLY one or the other although they tend to favor one and self classify as that. 

But if I were him and I didn't know about asexuality, I might categorize myself differently and then feel lesser than if I didn't measure up to that. I was simply giving him a different option in case he did feel that way. Which is why I said it was normal. He sounded confused about how to label himself and I wanted to give him more options in case he fell somewhere closer to that on the spectrum. 

It would be presumptuous for me to assume I know anything about his sexuality. I don't know him. But what he described sounds a lot like what we talked about which is why I brought it up.

 As a straight guy who's not very interested in women, I occasionally visit 2X to gain a broader perspective of everyday issues that affect normal people. It also helps to keep me in check as a man because I would not be aware of some of the more gender specific issues present in society if it weren't for 2X and some other female centric 'newspapers' and blogs. When you say you're 'not interested in women,' do you mean you find them boring, or that you're not romantically interested in women?  I ask because as a heterosexual male, I find myself in the latter category, and I've never encountered anybody else who feels the same way. I find that, as a heterosexual male and user of dictionary.com, you are both defying what it means to be hetero*sexual*.  To each their own, obviously.

Well, all I'd ask is, does it bother you that it doesn't bother you?  Because if it doesn't, it doesn't matter!  Interesting to hear, thanks for clarifying.  The purple color scheme is very relaxing.  I'm a man, but I do have two x chromosomes. Some of the issues women have, I've had in the past, and bodily speaking, still occasionally have now. That and, most of the time, the place is pretty damn welcoming.  At first I thought you were saying you had Klinefelter Syndrome than my mind caught up to me. Still might. Either FtM or Klinefelter. I guess since he says it's in the past, I'm going to assume FtM.  I think I come here because I don't really have any prominent female figures in my life. Also, for whatever reason, I tend to resonate better with posts here than I do with posts in most other subreddits. I don't know, maybe my brain is all messed up. I just like being here is all. :\ I don't think your brain is all messed up. You're always welcome to join us.

Im always surprised by how they look at things and by how different their lives are due to culture/physiological differences(ie the period).


So, its interesting to see what/how you guys think, your problems, etc.. thats why I frequent 2X. Same here. Guys speak up a lot out in meatspace. We are *loud* with our opinions. I'd like to hear women's voices more often. It is nice to have a space where I know I am supposed to sit down, shut up, and *listen*.   I just think women are interesting, and I like that the mods rule with a heavy hand here to chase out trolls and such.   The TwoXChromosomes community has a very supportive community, and there's always really thoughtful and intelligent discussion here. For the main subreddits the comment threads are predictable and generally trite - yes, let's have *another* pun thread! - but TwoXChromosomes treats its discussions seriously.

I've always identified with feminist issues but I've learned a lot from reading TwoXChromosomes. My annoyance with sexist bullshit has increased immensely both online and offline, and I try and (politely) call people out whenever I see it. I've read a lot of fascinating gender theory discussions here, and I think this subreddit has influenced me for the better. :-)  Mostly because it's a nice change from the rest of reddit. People aren't shoving or knocking each other down. I've never been to a place like that before. 

I generally don't comment very much here though, don't usually have anything constructive to add to the debate, but I like to read it.    This is honestly one of my favorite subreddits. The people here are very welcoming and accepting. Most of Reddit is incredibly sexist so this is one of the few subreddits that offers a more sane atmosphere.  I'm also here because I'm just generally interested in the female perspective.  I'm interested in issues that affect women and issues of equality.  There's more I could say, but this about sums it up. This is honestly one of my favorite subreddits. The people here are very welcoming and accepting.

though I tend to avoid the subreddit on Fridays. RES with a filter for IFF is great if you still want to come on Fridays without all the pictures. A few will get through, but a page with 2 pictures is a much better experience for me, than one with 20 pictures. This is embarrassing, but what is iff? This is embarrassing, but what is iff? Image Fest Friday. It is when everyone can post pictures of whatever they want. I get the impression that before I got here 2X got to the point a lot of subreddits do where pictures dominated the front page content. The community decided they didn't want the front page to always be pictures, so now pictures are only allowed on Fridays.  Well, I'm not female, nor will I ever be, but I date women and might one day raise one.  Additionally, I was raised in a fairly liberal, feminist family, with hard leanings towards civil rights.  Furthermore, my brother is queer and identifies quite strongly with gender issues both generally and specifically.  Ultimately I appreciate the opportunity to listen (umm, read).  Thank you for that.  I don't comment much on reddit, but I guess I'll add my two cents. 

The reason I subscribe to /twoX is the same reason I tend to visit skepchick or /feminism; I am a fan of gender and sexual equality, progressive thoughts on issues that concern both men and women. I also like to learn from others perspectives and see things from points of view I have not considered before. I live in an area that is very, uh, unenlightened about feminism (in all it's shades). That think if a woman has short hair, it must mean they are a lesbian, or if they are not reproducing they need to be, or that if a woman isn't in a relationship she's a prude/destined to be alone forever, or that jokes about rape and victim blaming is perfectly acceptable, and (what I dislike the most) MRA is very very dominant. I need something that isn't that kind of mentality, that almost-subtle narrow-minded bullshit point of view that so many people around me (not my personal friends, but the community that i live in) seem to have

I know that /twoX isn't /feminism, but /twoX has a much more diverse group of people. I read on articles posted, and stories, comments not because it's a female issue, but because it is a human issue. The first step in respecting others, in my experience, is empathy. And the first step in empathy is listening. So, I try my best to listen and understand. 

I subscribe here because it is interesting and because I feel it helps me grow as a person by hearing about some things I can never really experience because I am a Caucasian male. I've felt no hostility here because I am male and I've seen no real bullshit in here. I've seen things I don't agree with, but I move on from that still asking questions. I've seen posts that made me realize that I was in the wrong side on a position. It's a nice place here, and I am happy I found it.  If you haven't already, I would recommend exploring r/feminisms - with the S. I find it far more interesting than r/feminism and has much better debate (and a nicer less... aggressive? MRA-baity? tone).  Wonderful!

I think you described my reason for unsubscribing from r/feminism perfectly: It really does feel MRA-baity. What's MRA-baity? Baiting the Men's Rights Activists, who are often very anti-feminist.

Just to get a women's perspective on things.  As a straight guy, it's kind of like a Sun Tzu approach to relationships with women.  "Know your enemy and know yourself and you need not fear the outcome of a thousand battles."  It isn't that I'm trying to outsmart or "defeat" the women in my life, but communication between the sexes is complicated, almost like we speak different languages, I'm just trying to work on my cultural fluency. This woman genuinely appreciates an Art of War reference while getting to know someone though!       My girlfriend subscribed me to it and I'm too lazy to unsubscribe.  I like girls. They look pretty and have weird senses of humor and sometimes they make me cookies. They're also confusing, it's fun hearing  open perspectives from the ladies.  I like girls.

Ladies who bake, thank you for inviting me over to help you eat it.         Alright, I'm gonna level here. I'm a r/MR subscriber, and early on I adopted the practice of looking into r/feminism and r/feminisms to search for things I disagreed with. I took this up because the earliest stages of being a MR supporter are often the angriest. I was pissed at the system and wanted to look at what it was doing, more or less. This was also back when the MRM had very little support behind it and was commonly derided as the haven of neck-bearded, basement-dwelling, misogynist foreveralone trolls. To understand how I got into the routine, you have to understand that I was wholly and exceedingly angry. Angry at society, angry at feminism, and yes, angry at women. The early days of the MRM were where it got it's image of an unbridled ball of vitriolic hate, and as a new supporter letalone one of that period I was similarly consumed with this vitriol. That's why I prowled the three subreddits for something to be angry about. That's the motive.

I ended up finding something unexpected. One, r/feminism and r/feminisms have very little disputable content in them. Seriously, it's all pretty basal discussion about mostly current events and some pretty bland abstract topics. I'll admit it, I pop into those places near every day for over a year, and the amount of things I've found to be riled about could be counted on one hand.

The subreddit of r/twoxchromosomes falls into a different niche. While I was still prowling for entitled female behaviour to feel indignation towards, this subreddit provided a much more personal view, fronting the issues of individual women in their average lives. I was surprised to find that this subreddit *also* largely denied me any source of indignation. 

Furthermore, I found something even more surprising, that the women of r/twoxchromosomes were largely independent and able to handle their own issues. To clarify, I mean actually independent, not that horseshit "independent woman" stance that consists of having a job and being pissed at men as a class at all times while still being feeble regarding your own problems. Indeed, r/twoxchromosomes female members were often admirable, something very alien to a fledgling MRA who feels cheated and manipulated by the women of society.

Furthermore, a good portion of these self helping women were also *so* capable for their own sakes, that I felt the need to provide support. I felt this was a good niche for an MRA, because as a guy I would be more given towards providing honest, meaningful support for what these women have done for themselves, as opposed to things I typically saw as vapid "You are beautiful and strong regardless of anything else" comments that were common to many female endeavors.

It's basically progressed from there. I still check r/feminism and r/feminisms all the time out of reflex, but I find effectively nothing that can be seen as an attack to rebuke. r/twoxchromosomes gets checked along with the former, but is more often the source of honest respect from hard working women than any example of the complaints I held more vehemently against women in the past of my MRA youth.

**TL;DR**: Honestly came here looking for stupid bullshit to feel pissed about, and after a long time of frequenting here there is much more to admire than condemn. So, with all due respect, do you think of yourself still as part of the MRM or do you feel that you can relate to feminism better? And if you still identify with the MRM rather than feminism, could I respectfully ask why?  

Last term in my Gender &amp;amp; Society class, we spent a while talking about the different gender movements. Most of the people I know are feminists or align themselves on the feminism "spectrum" so I chose to do my essays and paper for that unit on the Men's Rights Movement and how they see each other, how they view feminism and why they get into the MRM. As someone who very firmly aligns herself with feminism and equality, I find the MRM very interesting because it does, as you said, seem to be born out of a lot of vitriolic hatred and self-destructive behavior. I still identify with the MRM, it's just that my positions are a lot milder now, seeing as the contributed anger from being a new member of a young movement has waned. Sure, I still have complaints regarding women, and even feminism, but the passage of time amounts to everything have mellowed a lot. As to why I still identify with the MRM, I still hold all the same positions regarding the issues MRAs put forth, it's just that such a level of vitriol simply couldn't last.

I will agree that the MRM is indeed a very angry movement, but I think that reflects the level of dissatisfaction many feel over current societal norms, combined with the fact that they can express them now with a relative level of safety. Men often feel significant levels of anger over their issues in life, we just have to suppress our initial reactions for the sake of polite discourse.

It's interesting that you mention the feminist spectrum, because I believe the MRM also has a spectrum, one that is far smaller due the young nature of the movement. Personally, I identify as a more moderate MRA. I was something of a concern troll early on, telling r/mensrights that we could be a lot more available if we just toned it down, and thankfully both of those things are now much improved. I also see the issue with feminism as being a simple overstep of ideology, that suffrage and the core winnings of feminism are all fine and dandy, but that current thought tends towards entitlement and fear-mongering, as opposed to feminism being some colossal enemy.

On the smaller spectrum, you have moderate MRAs that you wouldn't suspect when out and about, more hard-lined ones who make their positions and their anger much clearer, MRAs who still have hope for decent marriages, MRAs (like myself) who would effectively never recommend marriage, MGTOWs who feel that living a life somewhat distanced from women will allow you to be much happier, female MRAs who have the magnanimous compassion to see the other side (and who are often *intensively* criticized by their fellow women), and even people who appear to be very aligned on the issues but hesitate to identify with the MRM. Hmm, that's very interesting. I feel like I can sympathize with where MRAs come from but I disagree with a lot of their points. However, a lot of the MRAs I run into are the hard-lined, obnoxious ones who are of the opinion that all women are evil, gold-digging, dramamongers who are out to "get" them. Thank you for answering my questions thoughtfully and fully! I appreciate it. I love learning more about the "other side" without all the anger and vitriol. No problem. Also, remember that people can always drop by r/mensrights and ask questions, a lot of people are really pleasantly surprised at what they find. Folks are often quite taken aback when they don't receive the woman-hate they expect.

Because /r/oneXoneYChromosome is so boring..  [deleted]  Because women don't talk to me in real life. Well, do you talk to them?  Introverted Electrical Engineer.  I talk to them in the pure math classes that I have but never about anything important or meaningful other than math related crap.   Is 'introverted electrical engineer' supposed to mean that you can't talk to women/they wouldn't want to talk to you? I'm sure there are introverted women (or extroverted) in your class who would understand your personality and enjoy talking to you about meaningful things if you made the effort to start some conversations. 

As an introverted individual myself, I find that people often interpret your silence or lack of casual conversation as lack of interest. You just gotta bullshit about the weather and homework or whatever for a bit until you get to know the person better.

In my main courses there are around 120 people, and 1 girl who already has a boyfriend I'm pretty sure. Are you saying there is only one girl in all your classes? What? I'm a math/computer science major, and while there are definitely more guys in the classes, there are a decent number of girls. 

Assuming there is only that one girl, what prevents you from just trying to be friends with her? That is a possibility. You could really enjoy it. There is the added benefit of also possibly becoming part of her social circle and maybe meeting another girl who is single and interested in you. Bottom line: knowing more people can be a good thing. You don't have to aim for a romantic relationship.  Also, I never really mentioned anything about wanting a relationship, I was talking about why I read 2x.  But your assumption is correct, I am in fact a super lonely dude. Well, what you said sort of indicated that you were interested in a relationship. My initial statements were just in general that you should give talking to women a go until I got to this line:

&amp;gt; 1 girl who *already* has a boyfriend

Nowhere in my previous posts did I mention anything about boyfriends or girlfriends. Seems like you would like a girlfriend. Possibly this girl if she didn't already have a boyfriend.





 Didn't even realize I indicated that.  Fair enough.

I'm also on Reddit and I'm an EE, so I guess that's probably an indicator as well.            </snippet></document><document><title>To all you curly-haired ladies who share my woes:</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197dk4/to_all_you_curlyhaired_ladies_who_share_my_woes/</url><snippet>I used to shampoo every three days or so to try and keep from stripping my hair of its oils and making it all frizzy. In between I'd rinse with conditioner or just plain hot water until it started to get an oily look. 

So I was shopping around for a new kind of shampoo and conditioner and found these: 
[Deva Curl No Poo &amp;amp; One Condition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0045OR410). 

The shampoo is a non-lather so it doesn't leave your hair feeling quite so "squeaky" clean, which meeeeans I can wash my hair whenever I want and its going to dry fabulously silky smooth. Especially after I apply a little Redken curl wise 14. 

The smell could be better, but it doesn't smell bad.

Before I hardly ever PMS-ed and I had a very light flow, lasting 3 days max.

Ever since getting the depo, I've been extremely moody and irritable. I can't even count of the number of fights I've gotten into with my boyfriend partly because of this, and I cannot help it. :( I've decided to stop getting the shot obviously.

 Depo is the first and only BC I've ever been on. It's been a week since I was due for my next shot and have been noticing some effects like back and leg pain.

Need advice.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198s5v/my_relationship_is_making_me_insecure_need_advice/</url><snippet>My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now (we are both 21). We go to the same University but have very different lives when we aren't together. He's a frat boy who lives at home with his parents and I'm an athlete living far from home on my own. Most people would say that I'm out of my boyfriends league although I don't really see it as much besides the fact that he is shorter than me. 

Basically we have had a very strange relationship from the start and it was pretty quick. Within about 4 months we already starting saying I love you. About 6 months into our relationship we started getting really physical. A lot of play fighting and such, but more rough than the average couple. It slowly got worse and worse until we started hurting each other (no hitting or intended violence but regular bruising from pinching and bites). Recently I have had some serious conversation with my SO and we have decided we need to be less violent. We both have limits and we are starting to cross them. So things on that front have been getting better. 

But we also have been fighting a lot of petty fights lately. I get annoyed at the smallest things sometimes and my only reaction is to get bitchy. Sometimes I know I'm over-reacting but other times I feel as though I'm not but my SO won't take me seriously. 

We have also got into two really big fights recently. The first started with something small and escalated into my boyfriend basically breaking up with me. If I wouldn't have chased him out of my house and forced him to have a long argument and conversation then he would have broken up with me. I had to convince him to stay with me. 

Ever since that fight I have been feeling insecure about our relationship. I've been scared that he's going to leave me. Fast forward to this weekend. We had this giant blowout of a fight when we were both drunk. I know alcohol fueled the whole thing but it also has made me even more insecure. In this fight I literally ran two miles through town after him. I would have let him leave to think for the night and hopefully be clear minded in the morning but I panicked. I thought that if he left I would never get him back. 

I'm scared for the future of our relationship and for my personal happiness. I feel like I am getting more and more clingy while also pushing him farther and farther away. I feel a need to be with him because I'm insecure but I also pick stupid fights and be bitchy because I'm insecure. 

I'm lost and I don't know what to do. My relationship and my confidence are both going down the drain.  </snippet></document><document><title>college girl- pregnancy scare, need help</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/198rli/college_girl_pregnancy_scare_need_help/</url><snippet>Hi, sorry, I'm not exactly sure where to post this.

He had lured me into his bedroom by saying that he had to talk to me about something important regarding my brother. I fell for it. Once we were in his room, he climbed on top of me while I begged him to stop. He was 3x my size, and I just laid there sobbing while he ripped my pants off with both his thumbs. He forced himself into me, and as soon as he finished he walked out of the room without saying a word to me. I laid there crying my heart out for 2 hours. I drank myself into alcohol poisoning the next night. For months after, every night I would cry and cut myself until the pain went away temporarily. No one in my life knew the extreme emotional pain I was in. I would walk through my college campus, and without realizing it, I would begin to cry. I didn't even know why. I felt like I was a shell of myself left standing after my very soul had been shattered. But, as a twist in the story, HE goes to my college. Everytime I saw him, even if he didn't see me, I would run home and sit down crying for hours. I blamed myself. WHY didn't I hit him? WHY didn't I scream until someone came to help me? But after a year of this pain, I have finally reached a point of acceptance. Today I sat down in the cafe, and sitting across from me it was HIM. We made eye contact. My heart started pounding, I could hear it, my mouth became dry, a knot in my stomach, adrenaline rush.  I ran to the bathroom, expecting to sit down crying, but I nothing came out. I realized that I had finally reached a point where this situation isn't something that upsets me. When I saw him I didn't feel pain, I felt fear. It's a hardship that has made me into the strong person I am. Nothing can hurt me as badly as he did, so I don't let it. I am a stronger person than I ever was before, and while it was the most painful experience of my life, I wouldn't be the person I am now. To the ladies going through the same pain, know that it will get better away with time! My rapist still haunts my nightmares, but he doesn't haunt my soul anymore. I have finally reached a point where I can say, I was raped but I got through it. Sorry for the rant, but I still have no one else who knows how far I have come. Remember:

So it's not a right to them as if women are being denied, but the right to have everyone pay for them which of course goes against the conservative and libertarian mindset.

Anyone know of a video that is inspirational to women, but not politically motivated?  My target audience is mormon women, so when the politically liberal minded feminist agendas are shown, they shut down.   Baby steps for the indoctrinated, so if you want to be persistent, it won't help.  I did however like the parts of the video where women stand up for themselves, and don't want to be told what to do which is the sentiment I'm trying to convey.

Any videos come to mind?

Hi Reddit!

So my boyfriend [M21] and I [F20] have been dating for 3 years now and we've pretty much gone through it all. We've pretty much been forced to grow up and mature our relationship since it was so rocky and disastrous in the beginning. However, everything since the past two and a half years have been AMAZING and I couldn't ask for any more.

Recently we decided that we're getting married on paper to help me out with my international fees. However, since I'm the one being helped out, I want to be the one to pop the question! He's always been amazing to me and he always plans my surprises for birthdays, valentine's, christmas, and all special occasions, so I think it's my turn.

I know he wants to be romantic and do it too but I think he'll have that opportunity in the future when we're ready for a real ceremony.

**About him (ie TL;DR): He's a typical nerdy-geek gamer guy. He's obsessed with Star Wars and comic books, mostly Marvel comics. He loves videogames and writing and science fiction.**

Our style is mostly romantic but not public... so something small but very very thoughtful would do. I'm trying to think of ideas but it would be great if someone could top mine! (I'm not very creative).

I know we're young but we've thought about this thoroughly and are preparing for the future and any consequences that may arise from marrying early.  
  [This](http://media-cache-ec2.pinterest.com/550x/42/20/5a/42205ae58a02fc9014b1aea8abd69b00.jpg) is how I want to propose/be proposed to.

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation. I'm an older teenager and I have had a very serious boyfriend who I love for six months. My mom has always told me that I should talk to her if I decide to have sex, and knowing her I always figured that she would be pretty cool about it as long as she knew I was making a mature, well informed descision. As we've been dating for a while, its getting more and more likely that my boyfriend and I will have sex in the near future. There's no pressure from him, he's a perfect gentleman but I do think that I'm ready to take this step in our relationship. However, whenever I even get close to the subject with my mom, she completely freaks out and gets all weird, which is stressful for me because we've always been pretty open in my household when it come to talking about things like that. I told her a while ago that I wanted to go on birth control so that just incase anything did happen I wouldn't screw up my life for ever, but she reacted nervously and didn't really do anything about it. I want to be smart about this because I know that eventually I will lose my virginity and while I don't want to lie to my mom, I'm afraid she'll never let me see my boyfriend again if I talk to her. Any advice?       use condoms</snippet></document><document><title>What should I wear to my very first concert ?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1986xn/what_should_i_wear_to_my_very_first_concert/</url><snippet>I'm going to my very first concert at The House of Blues !
