Get yourself a book on amazon for $20 bucks and start doing some exercises. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think, we seem to be in extremely similar positions as I graduated last year and have recently gotten into the programming/compsci world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c43y6ul", "flair_text": null, "created": 1332470065.0, "created_utc": 1332466465.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 4, "link_id": "t3_r8hhd", "children": [], "author": "Wavicle", "id": "c43r8c3", "parent_id": "t3_r8hhd", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 6, "body": "I assume you're really looking for a programming job.

It should be noted that creep mutation requires a number of parameters \ncontrolling the distribution from which the random numbers are drawn, and hence the size of the steps that mutation takes in the search space. Finding appropriate settings for these parameters may not be easy, and it is sometimes common to use more than one mutation operator in tandem from integer-based problems. [...] Alternatively, random resetting might be used with low probability, in conjunction with a creep operator that tended to make small changes relative to the range of permissible values. \n\nNote that ordinal attributes mean things such as integers (2 is more like 3 than it is 389), while cardinal attributes mean that there may not be a natural ordering (for example: colours, compass points, martial status etc).

It should be noted that creep mutation requires a number of parameters \ncontrolling the distribution from which the random numbers are drawn, and hence the size of the steps that mutation takes in the search space. Finding appropriate settings for these parameters may not be easy, and it is sometimes common to use more than one mutation operator in tandem from integer-based problems. [...] Alternatively, random resetting might be used with low probability, in conjunction with a creep operator that tended to make small changes relative to the range of permissible values. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that ordinal attributes mean things such as integers (2 is more like 3 than it is 389), while cardinal attributes mean that there may not be a natural ordering (for example: colours, compass points, martial status etc). Both can be represented as integers, but you can&amp;#39;t treat them the same way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c49kfx5", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333827521.0, "created_utc": 1333823921.0, "num_reports": null}], "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "author_flair_class": null, "upvotes": 24, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "modhash": "cd4l2vml9nbf75ff7f7ca760c7403f27a51f28d636e0d67da3", "media_embed": {}, "more_comments": "", "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/compsci/comments/rxm6u/in_genetic_algorithms_what_are_the_effects_of/", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t3_rxm6u", "created": 1333785809.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/rxm6u/in_genetic_algorithms_what_are_the_effects_of/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "crussell8", "created_utc": 1333782209.0, "link_flair_text": null, "media": null, "num_reports": null}, "852": {"domain": "moyix.wordpress.com", "link_flair_class": null, "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 13, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "subreddit": "compsci", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "saved": false, "id": "rwpxk", "clicked": false, "title": "Simulating Turing Machines with Wang Tiles", "num_comments": 5, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_rwpxk", "children": [], "author": "moonrocks", "id": "c49bcwr", "parent_id": "t3_rwpxk", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "This is a very cool article with a polished presentation.

Let me know if you have any more questions or need any further info. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not let your emotions make the decision for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are vulnerable at this current state. Back when I was a freshman I had a knee jerk reaction to failure and said &amp;quot;I will absolutely major in CS&amp;quot;. Looking back, this was stubbornness and a hurt ego talking, not me. Don&amp;#39;t immediately dismiss CS either by saying &amp;quot;CS absolutely isn&amp;#39;t for me.&amp;quot; It may or may not be. Right now the aim is to just be as aware of your situation as possible. Relax things will be fine. Then ask yourself some of these questions and be honest with yourself. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you sure you aren&amp;#39;t studying CS b/c of some external factor? Maybe the faculty is really cool. Maybe you heard the money is great. Maybe you&amp;#39;re family/friends insist that you do CS? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What exactly drew you into CS? Saying I&amp;#39;m good at computers or I like computers is not good enough. A better reason might be &amp;quot;I like building computer software and want to learn more about computation/math/etc. to get better at this. Notice the differentiation between liking and liking to build. Lastly, this quote comes to mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Never be afraid to fall apart, because it is an opportunity to rebuild yourself  the way you wish you had been all along. \n- Rae Smith&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c494moi", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333711716.0, "created_utc": 1333708116.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_rvxoq", "children": [], "author": "[deleted]", "id": "c493iuc", "parent_id": "t3_rvxoq", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c493iuc", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333697931.0, "created_utc": 1333694331.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_rvxoq", "children": [], "author": "roblan01", "id": "c49e10o", "parent_id": "t3_rvxoq", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "I registered on reddit to say this.\nI'm a junior CS major.

You will travel the seven seas and conquer many kingdoms before using function pointers without some kind of reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c48aiv1", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333522656.0, "created_utc": 1333519056.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_rrfws", "children": [], "author": "Nihili", "id": "c4a4k2w", "parent_id": "t3_rrfws", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "I'd recommend\n\n* Introduction to algorithms (http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844)\n\n* fundamental algorithms by knuth (abit harder to get ahold of)\n\n* algorithm design manual (http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/). :)", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction to algorithms (&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844\"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fundamental algorithms by knuth (abit harder to get ahold of)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;algorithm design manual (&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/\"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/&lt;/a&gt;). :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4a4k2w", "flair_text": null, "created": 1333971800.0, "created_utc": 1333968200.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_rrfws", "children": [], "author": "tetramarek", "id": "c48231j", "parent_id": "t3_rrfws", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 5, "body": "I watched the entire course of Data Structures and Algorithms by Richard Buckland (UNSW) and thought it was excellent.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE621E25B3BF8B9D1\n\nThere is also an online course by Tim Roughgarden (Stanford) currently going on.

Please note that RAM model is an abstract representation of CPU - it fails to model the caches of real CPU - why? because RAM model assumes each memory can be accessed in constant time which is impossible in current CPUs. So RAM model is also unsuitable for explaining performance of Cache oblivious algorithms.\n\nFor example, Consider the program below:\n   \n    for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){\n        t=*p;\n        *p=*q;\n        *q=t;\n        p=p+1;\n        q=q+1;\n    }\n\nThe time complexity of the above program in a RAM model is 7n+2 steps.\n     ie. T(n)=7n+2\n\nLet's say, you want to compare two algorithms - one with time complexity as n^2 +3 and other with 100n+10 steps.

To make our life easier, we borrow the notion of Big O notion from *mathematics*. See Big O notion for more info. Thus, while Big O notion fails to explain why insertion sort is faster than quick sort for smaller arrays, time complexity can still be used to explain it.\n\n**Time complexity of a parallel machine**\n\nIn parallel machine, Time complexity is usually defined as number of steps taken by a Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model - think of PRAM model as a collection of processors (0,1..P-1), each connected to a infinite shared memory, where every processor can simultanously access some memory cell in constant time(processors execute in locked step fashion, but lets ignore those for time being). \n\nA parallel binary search for an array of size N in PRAM model can be specified as:\n\n    //search for x in data[begin]..data[end-1] \n    parallel_binary_search(x,data,begin,end) \n\n        s_valid=false; s_found=false\n\n        each processor with id (processor id is from 0..P-1), parallely do:\n            //partition the input array into P parts, [b,e) is id^th partition  \n            int b=parallel_begin(begin,end,id,P), e=parallel_end(begin,end,id,P)\n            if(b&lt;e){\n                if(data[b]==x || data[e-1]==x){\n                   s_found=true;\n                }else if(data[b]&lt;x &amp;&amp; x&lt;data[e-1]){\n                   s_valid=true;\n                   s_beginnew=b+1;\n                   s_endnew=e-1;\n                }   \n            }\n\n        if(s_found) return true\n        if(!s_valid) return false\n        return parallel_binary_search(x,data,s_beginnew,s_endnew)\n\n\nNow, how do we abstract out \"the time complexity of above algorithm wrt to PRAM\" in Big O notion ?

The way you approach the problem will also be different.\n\nFor example: \nReducing(fold) N elements with any monoid(associative&amp;identity) operation can be done on a N-PRAM in O(log N) steps. Example: sum,product, min,max etc. of N integers is in O(log N). Evaluating a DFA(state machine) is in O(log N)..\nPrefix computation(scan) of N elements with any monoid operation can be done on a N-PRAM in O(log N) steps. Example: partition N elements into two. merge two sorted arrays. etc.\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n* Time complexity is defined wrt a model/machine - Sequential algo uses RAM model, and Parallel algo uses PRAM model. \n* Time complexity is defined as number of steps in that model, usually a function of input size, number of processors etc. Big O notion is used to group the functions into set of families.

In my experience, this notational abuse, an attempt to hide the higher-order nature of &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt;, is a source of great confusion for computer science students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are usually interested in a kind of &amp;quot;normal form&amp;quot; of &lt;em&gt;O(f)&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, if &lt;em&gt;f = 3n+4&lt;/em&gt; expresses the number of operations your algorithm performs for input of size &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, then it is more useful to know that &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;O(n)&lt;/em&gt; (meaning your algorithm is linear in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) than to know that &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;O(2n)&lt;/em&gt;. To reach a normal form, you can, at least for polynomials, define a rewrite system which simplifies your &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; using the following (provable) rules:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;O(c&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;f) = O(f)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;O(f + g) = O(g)&lt;/em&gt;, if &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;O(g)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;O(f&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;g) = O(f&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;g)&lt;/em&gt; , if &lt;em&gt;f&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;O(f)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might then define a &lt;em&gt;O&amp;#39; : F -&amp;gt; F&lt;/em&gt; which maps an &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;f&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; such that &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;O(f&amp;#39;)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;f&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; is a normal form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c45hoar", "flair_text": null, "created": 1332867095.0, "created_utc": 1332863495.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 6, "link_id": "t3_rffwk", "children": [], "author": "soundslikeneon", "id": "c45e19s", "parent_id": "t3_rffwk", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 6, "body": "&gt; Can I view Big O as function with an output?\n\nYes.
