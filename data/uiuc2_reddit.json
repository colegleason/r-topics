LEX on the other hand, is basically the opposite: all the bus drivers are very friendly, but they tend not to adhere to their schedule if someone happens to be late, and I&amp;#39;ve read about safety regulations that they&amp;#39;ve failed to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer LEX, because I&amp;#39;d rather the bus be late (the most I&amp;#39;ve experienced is up to 40min) than not being able to get on the bus at all. Personal experience, and you can probably find my post somewhere in &lt;a href=\"/r/UIUC\"&gt;/r/UIUC&lt;/a&gt;, but my girlfriend had a 11am international flight so she had to get on a 3:30 bus (i think?), but she couldn&amp;#39;t because she forgot to print out the ticket as instructed by Suburban Express (notified around 5 times throughout the ticketing process), while this is entirely her fault, I believe their rules are a little too overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I don&amp;#39;t think Suburban Express is TERRIBLE, they are just a little strict and mean. Some people prefer that because being on schedule is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for LEX, I think most people like them until they run into something serious, like major delays or maybe a bus breaking down (I heard about it but haven&amp;#39;t really read anything on this matter).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8etr3v", "flair_text": null, "created": 1360808116.0, "created_utc": 1360804516.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 4, "link_id": "t3_18h2jo", "children": [], "author": "hazypensieve", "id": "c8etswc", "parent_id": "t3_18h2jo", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 23, "body": "I was recently banned by Suburban Express.
