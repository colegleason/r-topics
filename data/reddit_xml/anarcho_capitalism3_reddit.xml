My question is this: in an ideal an-cap society, how would grievances between differing parties be settled? It seems to me that a judicial system flies in the face of this philosophy.  A justice system in an anarcho-capitalist system can't be justifiably enforced without contracts.

**First, I'll cover the moment of aggression:**

Let's say that Tom commits an act of aggression against Bob. Bob is very angry, surely, and wants to right this wrong. He has every right to stop the aggression as it occurs, but only with just enough force that is necessary. If Tom is violently attacking him, he can stop Tom. If Tom steals from Bob, the act of aggression is going on for the entire time that Tom has Bob's property; Bob can retrieve it, using necessary force (pushing Tom out of the way, trespassing, breaking a lock, etc.).

**Next, I'll cover the options Bob and Tom have after this:**

Unless Tom has contractually agreed that he will go to court, receive a punishment, or something else to "right his wrong" in the case of aggression, Bob has no right to force Tom to do any of these things. All that Bob can do to Tom is suggest that it is in both of their best interest if Tom goes to court with him, or even makes a settlement out of court. Tom can agree, and if so, the situation is over. Tom signs a contract agreeing to abide by the court's decision, and if he does not abide by the decision, he has broken the contract, and this will end worse for him.

If Tom does not agree to arbitration, or if Tom agrees but then breaks his contract, he is not in a good place. No one has a right to initiate force against Tom, but the mechanism known as social ostracism comes into play. If Tom's offense (or even just the accusation against him that he has refused to go to court for) is great (murder, major theft, rape, major assault), then it is likely that he will be placed on a blacklist. Anyone that does not like murderers will not allow him on their property, and if he enters their property, they may use necessary force to evict him. Tom now has a few options:

He can enter a prison, or he can become a hermit. If Tom becomes a hermit, he will either homestead land or use the land he already owns to support himself, with very little assistance from anyone else, aside from other criminals. Murdering him or robbing him would be unjustifiable, but with no insurance, judicial, or protection agencies backing him up, it would be much easier for a person to get away with it.

If Tom enters a prison, it would be vastly different than a modern prison. Firstly, he would have no obligation to remain in the prison. Unless he agrees to punishment, he cannot be punished, and in fact the prison does not serve that purpose; it is a rehabilitation center. Tom will likely (he may not need to if it is a charity) perform labor in exchange for rehabilitation, food, safety and all else that he receives from the prison, and once the prison determines that he is reformed, it will issue him a certificate and ask everyone remove him from their blacklists. Tom would have to enter a prison reputed for reform; if a prison is known for not being able to reform criminals, its certificates will not be accepted, and if the certificates are not accepted, no one will go to that prison, and it will go out of business.

If you need any clarification or more specificity, just ask; I hope that this helps you to understand how courts may work in a free society. &amp;gt;He has every right to stop the aggression as it occurs, but only with just enough force that is necessary.

How is this force determined ? in ethical terms, that part did seem rather subjective to me.

but in practical terms, I assume that would be determined the same way everything else in private law is determined; you put an opinion out on the market, and if people like it, they'll pay for it. this creates precedent etc If you accept in Anarcho-Capitalism violence be sorted out by the market, you end up with [Anarcho-Capitalism being a tautology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18thxb/ancaptopia_population_you/). except states and markets are diametrically opposed to one another. Did you understand OP's logic ? that you can't have courts on a market? sure. however this is pretty outdated thinking. you might as well make the same argument for cars, or food, or healthcare. My comment was about [this OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18thxb/ancaptopia_population_you/). &amp;gt;He has every right to stop the aggression as it occurs, but only with just enough force that is necessary.

How is this force determined ? &amp;gt;He has every right to stop the aggression as it occurs, but only with just enough force that is necessary.

How is this force determined ? Whatever force is necessary to stop aggression. If someone is attempting to kill you, and you have the means to knock them out, you ought to do it. (although in that circumstance, your killing of the aggressor would likely be understood) If someone punches you, you can't just blow their head off; if they punch you once and stop, you should do nothing to them. If they punch you repeatedly, you should first attempt to stop them without doing harm (this is unnecessarily precise, which makes you look good in court and as an upstanding citizen, also I would rather avoid hurting someone), and if you aren't able to do that, make them stop punching you by punching them back enough to dissuade them (doesn't look good in court), or better yet, by knocking them out (seems to be a universal force to stop violent aggression). If a person is trespassing, you have no right to use violence (assault or murder) against them at this point; you should first ask them to leave, then pick them up/push them/get someone to do this for you. If the resist with violence, stop them, since now they're committing two acts of aggression. Knock them out, lol. If it's theft, ask for your property back,  if they don't listen, take it back, if they oppose you with force, stop their force. Even rape: if you are being raped, the other is using violent force against you to claim ownership- it is akin to both trespassing and violence, with a very strong social connotation. You should not kill this person unless that is the only way to stop them.

Essentially, this:

You shouldn't kill anyone unless that's the only way to stop them.

You shouldn't assault anyone unless that's the only way to stop them.

You shouldn't trespass unless that's the only way to retrieve stolen goods.

You shouldn't damage property (could be argued that this is trespassing) unless that's the only way to retrieve stolen goods.

These are the three acts of force that I can think of that can be permissible. There are 5 primary acts of aggression: murder, assault, rape, theft, trespassing. Rape is never justified, the others are justifiable in different situations of a person committing an act of aggression against you. I am afraid that your view of violence is a bit naive.
&amp;gt; if they punch you once and stop, you should do nothing to them.

If the aggressor is a fit male in prime of life and the victim is elderly, a child, or a petite woman, one punch can easily kill.

&amp;gt; If a person is trespassing, you have no right to use violence (assault or murder) against them at this point; you should first ask them to leave, then pick them up/push them/get someone to do this for you.

If you and your family are awakened by a home invasion in progress, the only thing that will save you is to shoot immediately and without hesitation.

The rest of what you wrote assumes that you can kill someone at will. Not so. Violence is uncertain. You can empty a handgun into an attacker and he can still kill you before losing consciousness from bleeding (and then fully recover after medical treatment). You can fire one round into an attacker's shoulder and see him drop dead on the spot. If you are in imminent danger of being killed by an attacker, you must shoot until he stops the attack, and no more. If this causes his death, he is to blame, not you.

May I suggest that you enroll in the NRA 4-hour course, "Personal Protection in the Home"?

It should be pointed out that there are varying opinions on this. A justice system in an anarcho-capitalist system can't be justifiably enforced without contracts.

Can I copy pasta this into a FB group I'm in full of sheep/slaves/statists?  Full cred will be given, but zero fucks. I don't care if you give me credit lol, and you don't need to ask, anything I say is fair game if it's advancing freedom :) Ah so you are a true free marketer.  Well played sir.

If you need any clarification or more specificity, just ask; I hope that this helps you to understand how courts may work in a free society. Is it really that hard to cheat blacklists in a large complex society?  This is explained in most anarcho-capitalist writings. Chapter 29 of David D. Friedman's "The Machinery of Freedom" probably explains it best. The book is now free in PDF form from Freidman's website.

See:

http://daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html

Admittedly, there are some (myself included) who are not persuaded by the explanation because we have some experience in criminology. That's a pretty interesting read. I'm still admittedly ignorant about many an-cap ideals, but would love to learn more. Can you suggest any one work that is a must-read?  This is explained in most anarcho-capitalist writings. Chapter 29 of David D. Friedman's "The Machinery of Freedom" probably explains it best. The book is now free in PDF form from Freidman's website.

Admittedly, there are some (myself included) who are not persuaded by the explanation because we have some experience in criminology. Based on your experience, what exactly about his explanation fails to persuade you?        Courts are nothing more than the surroundings of mighty beings. In the middle ages, the court was literally the open space of a castle where the lord resided. The meaning evolved and became more sophisticated over time, but the underlying principle remained the same.

So, how would a grievance between differing parties be settled? A mighty being both parties trust would settle it for them. </snippet></document><document><title>George Selgin on Free Banking (Part 1)</title><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P7W1G1hbiQ</url><snippet>  Prof. Selgin starts speaking at 2:32. &amp;amp;t=XhYmZs

&amp;gt;This [ronpaul.com's claims] is quite inaccurate and misleading in my opinion. First of all it's not a lawsuit. It's a domain dispute under the UDRP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Domain-Name_Dispute-Resolution_Policy).

&amp;gt;ICANN, a non-profit and non-governmental organization has established the Top Level Domains. As part of this private organizations policies, .com and .org fall under the UDRP policies which forbids companies from using other companies trademarks and provides dispute resolution to be handled by WIPO. Granted WIPO is a branch of the UN, but being governed by it's rulings is part of a voluntary business contract between the registrant and the registrar which is bound by contractual conditions with ICANN. And if WIPO was not available or willing to do this service, you can bet ICANN would have some other non-governmental organization doing it.

&amp;gt;This isn't some appeal to state authority to deprive someone of their rights to private property in their domain. In fact nobody owns their domain in the .com TLD. They register it and when registered and following the rules, ICANN agrees to have the .com nameservers host that record. If you don't follow that organizations rules, then you don't get to keep that service.

&amp;gt;If you think this system doesn't work, then anyone is allowed to setup their own DNS servers and convince people to use them instead of ICANN's TLDs. But the market seems to prefer ICANN and their system for trademark dispute resolution.&#65279;

&amp;gt;Additionally, ICANN has a good reason to allow this dispute and to rule in Ron Paul's favor. DNS is more useful when domain names accurately indicate who they represent. This is a service which makes the internet more accessible to the less skeptical and tech savvy, and more internet users means more business for ICANN and their registrars. Domain Squatting is a practice that ICANN has tried to combat for years, and for good reason, and what RonPaul.com is doing is very close to squatting.

I think Stephan Kinsalla is wrong on this. Consider the opposite. It is to say that you have the right to have your entry on the .COM DNS servers. You don't have that right, you're paying for a service and that service comes with conditions.

And I think that a totally private company, absent any government influence would have good reason to not allow people to make websites that appear to represent someone that they don't. It is for the integrity of their network. &amp;gt; *"This [ronpaul.com's claims] is quite inaccurate and misleading in my opinion."*

Normally, for most persons, I'd chalk it up to a mistaken or incomplete understanding, but this excuse doesn't work for Kinsella.  As an IP lawyer, Kinsella really should know better than this.  Presuming Kinsella does know better than this... I'll quote from a comment I made elsewhere on this issue

It is for the integrity of their network. Is the "dispute" because rp.com will not negotiate, or because RP does not want to negotiate?  From what I have heard, RP does not want to negotiate. I can't imagine rp.com would turn down $125,000 They demanded much more than that and sadly the rules of the ICAAN system flat out tell you to not build something this way - because you'll likely get it taken from you.

&amp;gt;This isn't some appeal to state authority to deprive someone of their rights to private property in their domain. 

This is an appeal to a pseudo-private entity which acts with a state mandated monopoly and empowered by a state-mandated monopoly on .com and .org domains when it was created. Please, tell me the alternative to the DNS system we have so that I can implement your brilliant idea and make millions - minds greater than ours haven't had any luck in the 20+ years they've been trying. If the centralized DNS system was set up through voluntary interaction instead of forcible monopolization and continued state monopolization and subsidization, I wouldn't have much of a problem, but that isn't what happened and to characterize ICANN as a "private" or "non-governmental" organization seemingly implying their authority and existence were created through voluntary interaction is simply dishonest. Again, someone doesn't understand the tubes. Dodge. If rainbows farted more we'd have more rainbows.

The fact of the matter is you describe a system that simply cannot exist in reality. Yeah, it's a beautiful theory, but it isn't realistic. ICANN is about as non-governmental as the Federal Reserve.

&amp;gt;This isn't some appeal to state authority to deprive someone of their rights to private property in their domain. 

This is an appeal to a pseudo-private entity which acts with a state mandated monopoly and empowered by a state-mandated monopoly on .com and .org domains when it was created. &amp;gt;a state mandated monopoly

Nope. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_DNS_root

The only reason it holds such a vast marketshare is because it is government funded and doesn't have to get funding from voluntary customers. That funding should end, I agree. But that doesn't make the domain dispute procedure illegitimate. &amp;gt;doesn't make the domain dispute procedure illegitimate.

It makes it state mandated and not "non-governmental." This *is* an appeal to state authority. If you think that makes the mandatory dispute process illegitimate than it's illegitimate. This simply isn't a case of private groups making voluntary contracts. By this logic, registering a domain at all is an appeal to state authority. Government owns and controls the .COM domain servers. Registering a domain on those servers is an appeal to state authority to have them host it in the first place. What do you think my logic is? Because the only claim I actually made is that petitioning a pseudo-governmental organization who is subsidized by government, created through government force, and a maintained monpoly through government force to take the registered domain of another is an appeal to state authority. I actually didn't make the claim that dealing with the pseudo-governmental organization in any way is an appeal to state authority. If I did, please point out that language. How can this be reconsiled?

If "petitioning a pseudo-governmental organization who is subsidized by government, created through government force, and a maintained monpoly through government force to take the registered domain of another is an appeal to state authority"

Then how is it not an appeal to state authority to petition a pseudo-governmental organizations who is subsidized by government, created through government forced and a maintained dominant provider in the market (they are not a monopoly) through government force to host a domain record on these servers?

If you want to not deal with government force, you don't have to. You can deal with any of the competing alternative root dns providers and register your domain there. The fact that you don't only goes to further help the government maintain this position in the market.

Yet you don't, you use the government service.  Then you balk about being held to the contract of registration which includes the possibility of having your registration reallocated as a result of a domain dispute? &amp;gt;How can this be reconsiled?

Degree of force employed.

&amp;gt;Then you balk about being held to the contract of registration which includes the possibility of having your registration reallocated as a result of a domain dispute?

I balk at the claim it's a non-governmental organization or the dispute is a private contract matter. Please, carefully read my responses. ICANN is about as non-governmental as the Federal Reserve.

&amp;gt;This isn't some appeal to state authority to deprive someone of their rights to private property in their domain. 

This is an appeal to a pseudo-private entity which acts with a state mandated monopoly and empowered by a state-mandated monopoly on .com and .org domains when it was created.  I had to check which subreddit I was in after reading all the support for Ron Paul here. I don't know what's in the domain registration contract, I'm thinking strictly in terms of an ancap perspective to IP laws.

Ron Paul should register his own domain name if he wants a site, rather than potentially ruining all the hard work these people have put in to their site. RP is trying to use statist ideology to get what he wants and that is wrong.

 You might wish to read and examine the situation more closely before buying into superficial headlines about what's occurring. Yes, I was going to mention i had only this video and the comments here to go on. I thought perhaps people were getting caught up in the agreed contract while I am focusing on IP laws.

I recommend it highly.

Oh yeah, anything by Ghibli you can expect to be really good with a nice message behind it. Another one of their films, Howl's Moving Castle has a very strong anti-war message.

Edit: Just read the wiki page on it, apparently Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie was directly inspired by the Iraq war. I hope this part in Howl's Moving Castle resonated with the audience as much as it did with me:

- "A battleship?"
- "Still looking for more cities to burn..."

- "Is it the enemy's or one of ours?"
- "What difference does it make?"

I can't blame you and your twisted sense of morality. Just understand that you are my enemy and you are just as dangerous to the culture firearms freedom advocates are trying to defend - that is, the preservation of personal sovereignty - as any gun-control advocate in Washington.

And there you just told on yourself. Your goal isn't to actually convince anyone but to express solidarity with your tribe. As arguments for or against any proposition, idea, political philosophy, or ethical system pile up online and are a simple search away, I have to increasingly wonder whether anyone who participates in typing stuff on the Internet really is open to being convinced of anything.

The naked honesty of simply ranting for its own sake, or to let off steam, or what have you, is more refreshing than the bullshit "I'm open minded and looking for rational argument" pose that outright ideologues tend to strike.  You can spot them a mile away -- they're the ones who ask lead-in questions with big innocent puppy-dog eyes, hoping you'll respond in a certain way so they can unleash their pre-packaged argument against it. 

One point I make to gun owners is that this isn't about "having a conversation."  When the other side says we "have to have a conversation about guns," they don't actually mean they want a conversation -- they mean they want gun control and for people who don't want it to shut up and hand over their hardware.  That's what they mean by "conversation."  It's similar to the reddit classic, "[Subreddit], We have to talk" -- which is actually short form for, "I am going to insist that you do things my way in this subreddit from now on."

We live in a corrupt authoritarian kleptocracy run by old boys network technocrats.  The battle is won or lost on the basis of which faction can guarantee their existing privilege and power.  

Fighting fair in such an environment is a loser's strategy.  Which is why when people bitch about the NRA's influence, I just have to laugh -- because if the NRA was pushing gun control and had the same influence, they'd be hailed as a "grassroots organization of people concerned with gun violence" and as proof that the "system works."
  I don't post there anymore, they are mostly statists. I don't post there because I have no idea whatsoever what is supposed to be on topic/allowed on /r/guns.  I think /r/guns would be happiest if it was a subreddit dedicated to complaining about topic-worthiness of submissions and just forgo the whole gun thing altogether. 

Then there is the "I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT BUT PRO-GUN" contingent who wants to be congratulated on not being an asshat about guns while they're asshats about everything else.

I think I'm turning into a bitchy curmudgeon.  Seriously, IRL I could probably drink for hours with a commie and politics won't even come up but online I think everyone (probably myself included) has become insufferable.

Or maybe I'm just in a pissy mood on account of, you know, another year, bigger and more intrusive government.  When I was 21 I would have thought the bottom would have fallen out by this point, but I am gradually coming to understand that the tolerance for authoritarianism is nearly without limit, so long as the atrocities are happening to someone else.

With some irony, perhaps, it is socialist folkie Billy Bragg who put it best: "...but as long as you're comfortable, it feels like freedom."

The true horror is not really the state -- it never was.  The true horror are the vast numbers of citizens who applaud it, the more meddlesome or outright abusive it becomes.

So pretty much everything besides most shotguns and muzzle loaders? Good plan, Olympia, good plan. [The greatest battle implement ever devised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand) would still be allowed. The gun grabbers would be surprised by how much damage one can do with a gun that isn't scary and black. That's not a nugget. One of my fears for gun control in the short term is that Obama cracks down on imported guns and ammunition. As far as I'm aware that sort of thing falls almost entirely under the purview of the executive branch, one stroke of a pen and all the nice cheap eastern European surplus is gone. You are worried about prices? Really? Because if the price rises significantly on ammunition no one will be able to use their Mosin Nagants or their 5.45 chambered AKs. Why wouldn't I be worried about the state fucking with a hobby that I'm into? It's not my number one concern certainly but it is something that could very easily come to pass within the next year, I don't think anything involving mass confiscation will happen that soon.  Sounds like you rely on the state to some degree for this ammo. You should figure out how to procure it through other means or to create it yourself. 


Anarchism, bro.


How do you feel comfortable giving the state and global companies money for that shit anyway? It's like spending money on drugs if you are using the shells recreationaly, the product just disappears after you use it. 


edit: I'm really trying to understand this because from my angle this whole gun control debacle is just some fat cats cashing in on fake panic created by people who have to "Stock up" on ammo and guns. I just don't understand how this "Debate" is valuable to anyone except for those whom are profiting at the top. Here's the situation. A bunch of former soviet republics have a whole ton of surplus guns and ammunition lying around. It's been created already and they're not making more of it, it's a valuable resource that's just lying around. Yes it's a resource that's been created by the state but there's no way to retroactively change that. The state took capital out of the economy and transferred it to guns and ammunition. That capital can either stay out of the economy or it can re enter it via importation and private purchases. I rely on the state for ammo the same way you rely on the state for your computer, that is to say the state is heavily involved in the business of importing goods. 

How do I feel giving money to global corporations? Fucking great. Instead of capital being taken out of the market and completely going to waste I'm putting it to some use. This is /r/anarcho_capitalism not /r/anarchism, I don't expect to be shamed for participating in voluntary exchange here. 

The reality of gun control is useful information for people who are in any way interested in owning guns and ammunition. You think they're over priced now, just wait until they become illegal to import or manufacture. That very thing happened with automatic weapons in this country, in 1986 an automatic weapons ban was put in place that barred their sale to civilians if they were manufactured after 1986. The value of pre '86 automatics went way up after that, if you want one now you'll have to shell out upwards of 10 grand.

Very interesting, and i like where your head's at, Collin. (In regards to circumventing laws, not that you were advocating "damage" or anything.)    While looking for guns they may even find assault cars, assault knives, or dare i say it, assault pencils.  About a week ago they were trying "Assault Bullets" on for size. A week ago? They've been on about "cop killer bullets" since the mid-80s. I still don't know what the hell a "cop killer bullet" is. A week ago? They've been on about "cop killer bullets" since the mid-80s. I still don't know what the hell a "cop killer bullet" is. While looking for guns they may even find assault cars, assault knives, or dare i say it, assault pencils.  I've seen the Bourne series. They need to ban assault-newspapers.  Living in Olympia means putting up with stupid ass shit like this all the time.  The great thing though is that usually the dumbest shit, like having the city run power or this stupid flappin law, pretty much always ends up failing.        This has always been part of the process in the UK. You are obliged to keep firearms under lock and key at all times.   When you apply for or renew a license and - by appointment - at any time in between, the police may request you let them in and show them where you keep your guns.

Seems reasonable to me. This has always been part of the process in the UK. You are obliged to keep firearms under lock and key at all times.   When you apply for or renew a license and - by appointment - at any time in between, the police may request you let them in and show them where you keep your guns.

Seems reasonable to me. Guess that "unreasonable searches" are just fine for you. 

I like being secure in my property and effects against the state searching me for contraband like I'm in prison.  Not at all. I think that it's entirely reasonable that there are stated responsibilities to firearms ownership and that they are enforced.
That's how we have so few thefts of firearms and so few negligent and criminal firearms deaths.
And, like I said, they make an appointment, not just turn up unannounced. In the United States...

Oh nevermind, enjoy your surveillance state. Just trying to provide a bit of international context to your local problem.  The US obviously has a serious firearms violence problem that is directly related to it's firearms licencing policies. I struggle to believe that Americans are just more murderous than other nations...

Gun ownership in the UK has been rising for years, while gun crime has been falling away.  We must be doing something right that we don't even need to regularly arm our police. Your police have plenty of arms at their disposal and ready to be used at some point in the future, should it be determined that such firepower is necessary.  I know, because I've surveyed them.  Well, London Metro anyway.  On account of the TV show.  I was curious what firearms were issued when they were issued.  Glocks.  Like most other police departments the world over.

It was a hilarious exchange of information, actually.  Every PD in the world except for Hong Kong (coincidence?) just answered my questions in 48 hours or so by e-mail, generally in an informal manner, and generally they just forwarded my questions on to armorers who wrote back.

Britain, on the other hand, responds with this big Freedom of Information thing and how they'll have to think it over for a few months, whether or not I'm allowed to know what handguns British cops carry, when they carry.  Months later they decided, after much paperwork and hand-wringing no doubt, it was alright to tell me.  (Hong Kong PD basically told me to go fuck myself.  There's some honesty in that.  Australia, New Zealand each got back to me in two days and the Australians even put a smiley emoticon in the e-mail.)

That is emblematic of my impression of how things work in the UK.  On the other hand, it would doubtless be of great comfort to British citizens to know their government wasn't willingly giving out details of how they arm their cops to American gun nuts...at least not without a lot of paperwork, bureaucracy, and foot dragging.

I do not know if you don't understand, or are ignoring, the context of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution which to my knowledge has no specific analog in Britain, but in summation (giving you the benefit of the doubt, odd though it seems to have to explain this in an anarcho-capitalist subreddit):

Those of us who own firearms understand that one of the purposes of owning them is a defense against tyranny.  Tyranny can be a foreign invasion, or it can be a criminal invading your house, but it can also be the state -- your own government (increasingly in the hands of corporations).  This last part is important.  You will never actually understand American gun culture unless you focus on this last part: government.  The state.  We do not have the same relationship with our government as many other countries' citizens have with theirs.  Every country has critics of their respective government.  The way we look at our government here is a whole different thing.

See, people all over the world tend to have opinions on the US government.  I know this because they can't help but share it with me.  The opinion they have tends to be something I would not describe as admiration.  They would point out all of the terrible things it does, how it is out of control in terms of civil liberties, civil rights, and even war ethics (them 'drones!), and how it is basically an unchecked bully -- 

...and then insist that it's a good idea for us to submit to the same bully in terms of regulating our firearms.  Sure American people as individuals are alright if a bit loud and fat sometimes, but the US government...horrible.  Just terrible.  But we mostly alright, loud fat individuals should definitely allow the US government to monitor such things nonetheless even though that same government can hardly be described as being anything approaching responsible with its own guns.

We have violently taken up arms against the government (and yours!) in the past and we shall likely do so again, if not anytime soon.  This is a virtue.  Popular though it may be to demoni(s)e people with these views, I have to say, there's little more heroic in the human experience than taking up arms against the state -- especially one's own.  

This does not tend to occur, I would point out, when states are not meddlesome, oppressive enterprises.  They tend to occur when things have shit the bed.

Putting the tracking, monitoring, or regulation of firearms in the hands of the same state against which such weapons may be deployed one day is a contradiction in terms.  Do you not understand this, or do you understand this and want to debate this, and if so why on an anarcho-capitalist forum?

A fair amount of British people, by which I mean the ones who are apologists for their own government, take the state for granted.  They cannot imagine a Britain without the state (this has been explicitly explained to me by British people I've talked to who don't understand Americans and guns).  

For every television series (and the British are fantastic at making these -- far better than we in the US are) which paints a picture of a grossly wasteful, inefficient, undemocratic, and ultimately corrupt government (well, these shows are just fiction, right?  Well you might say that.  You might very well say that, but I could not possibly...oh nevermind), they will rush to justify any and all excesses of that same state nonetheless -- be it Britain's gun intrusive gun control laws, surveillance camera network, or what have you.  

In the end, the British people like their (unarmed, for now) cops, and they like their "system."  Those of us in the US who are, well, like me, don't like our cops, don't trust our government, and would sort of not shed a tear if the whole thing collapsed tomorrow.  My "American-ness," and for all of this anarchist stuff, I am inescapably American, is more tied to something bordering on hate for my government than it is love for it.  Nothing that strikes me as quintessentially American mixes well with it.  Government is a terrible cocktail mixer with bourbon, for example. 

I don't trust my government.  I don't like my government.  I am not not a fan, advocate, or booster of my government.  I would not piss on my government if it was on fire. 

And they are not welcome in my home or my gun cabinet.  And they are certainly not welcome to take stock of, and create a database of, who has firearms.

I would absolutely like less violence.  No question.  But not at the price of putting the regulation of firearms in the hands of the same government responsible for warrantless wiretaps, extraordinary rendition, endless war, shipping firearms to organized crime in Mexico, Japanese internment camps, the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, COINTELPRO, MK-ULTRA, endless war, empire, the drug war and all of its excesses, barbed wire and paramilitary-guarded borders, nuclear bomb dropping, TSA patdowns and body scanners, and so on.  

If Americans were exactly like the British in terms of their sensibilities, my opinion on allowing the fox to guard the henhouse would not be any different, even if it did reduce violence in the short term.

The most efficient "defense" firm has achieved a regional monopoly, just as market theory predicts.  This will soon be leveraged into a global monopoly via some planned mergers and acquisitions.  You all are just business failures complaining about losing out in the free market.

Prove me wrong.  What you're doing here is classifying everything that ever happens as part of the free market. It is not. Acts of aggression, criminal activity, are very distinct from markets. Mafia families are not set up by being the most efficient on the market, but by conquest. Governments set themselves up in the same way.

Furthermore, just because something *has* happened this way does not necessarily means it is the most efficient way possible. Believe it or not, society *can* be improved upon and is not already necessarily at the pinnacle of evolution.

So no, your just wrong, plain and simple. If the US and Canada can live next to each other in peace, then a regional monopoly clearly isn't necessary, and anarcho-capitalism is merely a matter of breaking down the state into smaller and smaller sections until you've reached the individual. And when every man is his own government, his own sovereign, you have anarchy.    Criminals aren't considered a component of the free market.  Then what are the defense firms for? What I'm saying is that criminals are not a market actor. The mafia, or any thief in general, is not comparable to a real business. The state is by definition a criminal entity, and as such is necessarily not a firm acting within the confines of the free market.  This is Ancaptopia.

Would you care to expound on this idea, good sir? Then what are the defense firms for? Then what are the defense firms for?   &amp;gt;We already live in an Anarcho-Capitalist society.

I think what you mean is we live in anarchic reality which is 100% true; the laws of Physics do not ordain any particular human order.  We are the reason why we are structured this way.

But, you should really say we live in panarchy, not anarcho-capitalism.

&amp;gt;The most efficient "defense" firm has achieved a regional monopoly, just as market theory predicts. This will soon be leveraged into a global monopoly via some planned mergers and acquisitions.

Well, this is where you're just flat out wrong.  The current statist systems emerged out of psychological delusion and self-denial, not from efficiency or economic dynamics; states, after all, collapse for economic reasons.

&amp;gt;You all are just business failures complaining about losing out in the free market.

At last, we see the end motive; what a miserable, negative existence.  But, we create the lives we deserve. &amp;gt;The current statist systems emerged out of psychological delusion and self-denial, not from efficiency or economic dynamics

Defense firms need advertising, too, yes? Nah, these systems were created from the bottom up by the species.  What's being said is that the conclusion to have a state does not follow as advisable given what its biggest proponents from the species wants to accomplish.  It's economically irrational and could only be conceived as a rational choice through psychological delusion, myopia, and self-denial.

Also, the fact that that was all you responded to I take to mean you've defaulted the larger philosophical issues at play here and ultimately the argument.     </snippet></document><document><title>Lew Rockwell Admires the Presidency.

Could someone please enlighten me on this? 

Usually, we can deal with the problems of regulation for things 'around the peripheries' of economics, like insider trading (spreads economic knowledge through prices, leading to efficiency), balance of payments (it's pretty self-righting) etc, but I don't know a way around this.

Say I get together with a bunch of my very rich buddies and we decide to perform a little scheme. First, we buy a bunch of shares of a relatively small company, so that we own 10% or more of its shares, perhaps up to 60% if we get bold and there's no regulation. The other shareholders are overjoyed at this new demand because it means that they can sell their shares at higher prices later. The price of the shares therefore rises. If we're discovered, then the other shareholders sell all their stock before the 'dump'. If not, then we dump the stock ourselves. Either way, this involves selling all your stock of that company at once at the new inflated price. So now, simply because we bought a bunch of stock, the price rose, so when we sell it again we'll make a bunch of money before anyone figures out what we did, and we'll make out like bandits. This messes with the ability of the firm to figure out how well it's doing (should they expand the operations? Clearly someone seems to believe there's a market for their goods since they're buying so many shares, so maybe they should invest more! Except while that's the signal the pumpers are sending, it's not what they actually believe), and the whole thing, when done on a large scale by very rich shareholders, can lead to the kind of market fluctuations Keynes talks about (a potential origin for the animal spirits), and, along with a bunch of herd mentality, could lead to financial ruin for many shareholders and, crucially, entrepreneurs not part of the ingroup for no real economic benefit. It makes business more unstable and harder to do. 

Could someone please provide me with an *economic* argument as to why this is not a problem, or is it just something we have to deal with and accept alongside all the benefits of the free market?  Caveat emptor. Folks who are buying should take a good look into the stocks they're buying. This is what fundamentalist analysis is for. If the fundamentals for the company don't justify the price, cautious people won't buy it on the way up, much less on the way down. And if there's an environment where buyers are generally cautious, the liquidity of the shares won't be great when the dumping begins, which might make the whole operation not so worth trying.         </snippet></document><document><title>One of the biggest fallacies IMO: Statists don't understand what the Free Market actually means</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18ram3/one_of_the_biggest_fallacies_imo_statists_dont/</url><snippet>I was watching the documentary about Enron the other week and I couldn't help but notice that when I heard the 'experts' talked about the dangers of "free market regulation", they completely ignored about the state subsidies that Enron had received in the first place. 

I mean this is so simple, but I see this very argument used all of the time. When people talk about what they think is free market, they don't even consider the corporate welfare, subsidies and lobbying which allows the problem to happen in the first place, which is NOT free market.

  Those are the statist memes.

 - Free market failure caused X! (great depression, dot com bubble, housing bubble, etc)
 - Free market needs to be regulated or it will collapse! When they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, banks went suicidal! We need to regulate the economy to ensure this doesn't happen.

There are many more variations on these memes. I think you're right -- they cannot imagine an economy without the state, so all of their proposed solutions are by the state, and all the problems they blame on the free market.

Statists gonna state.  They're stuck in thinking about society and economy always in terms of the state. So "free market" to them means some kind of fascist state control monstrosity run on behalf of some private elite, intended to enslave and subjugate the masses. Anything the state doesn't have a hand in literally "does not compute" and doesn't exist. lololol yeah idiot statists everyone who doesn't agree with me is such an idiot  For a minute I thought you meant fallacies we had about statists.

As much as this is a problem, we also have to step around the no true scotsman fallacy.  Rather than say that the existing situation isn't a free market, point out the actual reasons you think government had a role in the problem.  No, IMHO the statists understand the free market just fine.  The intentionally confuse the issue, because they want to be granted the pretext to attack and steal.  To "get theirs", fuck everybody else.   Hanlon's razor, man.

&amp;gt;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. Hanlon's razor, man.

I'll bet you're itching for a peeved follow up comment as well. No. I retract my comment. The worst are conservatives.    What subsidies and for what purpose did Enron receive and how did those subsidies had influence on the Enron behaviour? Honest quest. I can't see how subsidies did play any role in Enron behaviour and it sounds more like a no true scotsman on your part. But if you have information to the contrary, I'd love to hear them.  How would a truly free market had stopped Enron in behaving the way they did?  &amp;gt;What subsidies?

Massive loans.

&amp;gt;What purpose?

For Enron's success, because of their lobbying efforts.

&amp;gt;How did those subsidies influence Enron's behaviour?

It breeded more and expanded the forms of their shitty activity, since the U.S. government was always there to help! Imagine if the government started giving millions to thieves. What would happen?

I like this article by Ron Paul on this : http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/paul12.html What subsidies and for what purpose did Enron receive and how did those subsidies had influence on the Enron behaviour?

I object to the use of the phrase "assault weapons". It's a meaningless and ill-defined scareword thrown about by the media. The two relevant types of weapons are semi-automatic and assault rifles.

(Labels/Branding/Identity)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18s234/what_should_we_call_ourselves/</url><snippet>I recently attended the International Students for Liberty Conference, and this idea came to mind during a few discussions I had with people there. Do you think it detracts or adds to our arguments to identify ourselves publicly as libertarians/AnCaps? Would have that political label remain ambiguous be to our advantage in discussing our ideas with others?

I'm reminded of how much stigma our label carries with it right now, but it may be possible to reclaim it from the stigma. However, I also notice how "liberal" has become fairly derogatory in common usage. In essence, it's a question of becoming stereotyped and thus losing validity. Then again, a label can be useful in finding others with similar beliefs more easily. What do you all think about the use of a label for your beliefs?  I would say:
"I'm a Voluntaryist, I believe all human action should be voluntary."

Stateless societies along with capitalism are merely the products of taking this belief to it's logical conclusions.

 I would say:
"I'm a Voluntaryist, I believe all human action should be voluntary."

Stateless societies along with capitalism are merely the products of taking this belief to it's logical conclusions.

 &amp;gt;Stateless societies along with capitalism are merely the products of taking this belief to it's logical conclusions.

A person must already have built-in definitional agreement with you on property and aggression to follow to that conclusion. True, though I wouldn't need to say any further for the majority of people as most already agree with private property and capitalism.

Dealing with socialists would be an entirely different animal.  I don't need a label. I'm just a philosopher. &amp;gt;I'm just a philosopher.

That's still a label.   I go by voluntarist when looking to have an honest conversation, ancap among like-minded folks, and *anarchist* for shock value.    I don't think people who dismiss based on labels are really a fertile target market.  Even if a new name was found it would quickly be attacked and besmirched by opponent, media, and politicians.  

I try not to worry about labels and monikers.  They are a tool for facilitating communication and that's how I try to use them. I will change based on what best allows me to present a message to the person or people I am trying to communicate with.    Don't use a label. Come up with a paragraph or less that encompasses what you think, and if someone asks "what do you think about politics" or something along those lines, you can give them that short description, tailored a bit for the situation, instead of a label that they can distort or have a prior bias against.

I think that everyone should have their own explanation of their views, otherwise we will have one paragraph-long label attached to us, which isn't really the point. I'll give you an example of what I might say, though: 

*"I think that people who force others to do what they want should be stopped. People should be able to do anything that they want, so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. You might not think it, but I think that "governments" count in that group of "people who force others around"; I don't mind if you or anyone else wants a government, I just think that people who don't like it shouldn't have to be forced to follow it."* That paragraph's not a bad start.

Of course, the very next conversational piece will be the free rider problem, which should be respected and answered.    Here are some hard and fast rules for those curious how to maximize their conversational impact from my years of talking face to face with people about this (when it comes up; I don't go around shouting this stuff from the rooftops):

* 85 times out of a 100, DO NOT refer to yourself as anarchist.  You can do it if you're talking to someone who's *very* educated and probably also has radical politics.

* Instead, default to libertarian or ancap.  Libertarian if it's someone you suspect is very uneducated and socially conservative.  Ancap with any other (don't actually say, "anarcho-capitalist"; say literally, "ancap."  Ancap makes them go, "what?"  It's completely fresh ground with people and you don't have to overcome any preconceived obstacles.

* When you introduce the topic, DO NOT just say or say first, "I want to abolish the government."  Say, "I want to introduce more checks on government abuse; I want to give people more options."

If you can follow this progression, you are already 40% of the way with people, and, if they're on the upper end of the IQ spectrum (I'm in a lot of math and science classes with smart students and professors and have had a pretty successful track record because of that.), you stand a *very* good chance of eventually converting them *or at least* injecting an absurd amount of doubt in their confidence in government solutions.

As the person gets to know, befriend, and respect you, your influence will only increase from there.  Let them come to you and only talk about these issues as they come up; DO NOT be that annoying asshole everyone hates that never shuts tfu about politics or is so dogmatic that he can't listen to someone without berating them.

It may be true that we have more experience and a nuanced understanding of these issues relative to the public or even among the 'educated' demographic, but we should still be placating.  It wins friends, respect, and increases your influence.  It also makes for more enjoyable conversations, for both parties.

To more specifically answer your question, I've thought more and more about removing the anarcho prefix in ancap and replacing it with something else (my preference for the term political nihilism over anarchism being the inspiration), but haven't yet figured out what it should be or a completely separate term, but one that still doesn't use anarcho or anarchist in it.

I never really liked voluntarist/voluntaryist because of the built-in moral assumptions.  Maybe polycentrist?  I kind of like it.      libertarian, voluntar(y)ist are both better than anything containing any hint of anarchism or capitalism, each of which carry with them excessive baggage you'll have to have a tedious conversation about before you can get to the heart of the matter:

Except in very limited circumstances/audiences, "anarch*" is just a losing term unless you really want to have the conversation that a sports riot is not what anarchy looks like...again.  Or if you want to have a big discussion about how you're not a Red who pretends to be opposed to vanguards of various sorts.  It just closes minds.

Capitalism suggests, increasingly, anything other than the free market in the minds of people.  On a personal level, it also suggests an interest in business and money, which I just don't have or care about.  I will never be rich and I will never own my own business because that to me is a nightmare scenario.  Bad enough I have to work for someone else.  Bad enough I have to work, period.  

It's just that my personal tastes and lifestyle preferences have nothing to do with what other people choose to do with their lives.  Seriously, discussions on economics bore the everloving crap out of me beyond the moral mandate of do what thou wilt...just don't do it at or on me.  I never know what to do with myself when I'm around libertarians who want to talk about economics.  That's where I start looking for a cat to pet or something.

So, describing myself as an anarcho-capitalist is fraught with pitfalls, not the least of which is encountering an anarcho-capitalist who wants to talk about something Mises wrote.  (I have never read anything by Mises other than what is quoted in Internet discussions.  And I never will.  Have a huge booklist with like, Kafka and Shakespeare and shit on it.  Not enough years in a lifetime to get to economics texts.  Seriously, it's as exciting as folding socks is to me.)

This is why it's funny encountering someone who wants to hate me for my politics.  I mean, I'm a vegan.  I like music concerts and rural living and coffee places and folk music and shit.  Sure I am armed to the fucking teeth but we all have our quirks.  There is nothing like standing in line at the food co-op behind some guy in a Che t-shirt with a bunch of organic vegetables thinking, "If this guy only knew what was in my head...he'd want to...he'd want to...probably argue at me."  

No...actually, more likely sneer at me (on the inside, it's bad form to actually start class war in a food co-op) and say nothing until he was clear of me and then jump on facebook and type to all of his leftie friends how he ran into a capitalist pig at the co-op and disapproved of me like a boss.)

In point of fact, I don't actually like business.  I hate advertising.  Consumerism.  Cheap plastic shit.  I hate strip malls.  I hate all of this sort of, smelly liquid excrement, the fecal matter business leaves behind it.

But I hate the state and pushing people around and telling them how to live their lives more, and oh, hey Mr. WTO protestor, what corporation made that megaphone you're yelling through and the phone you're texting your "comrades" on?

So I believe in a free market - the "truly free market."  Sometimes people wear suits and ties in it and sometimes it's hippies selling weed brownies, but so long as no one is standing on my dick, it's fine by me.  I don't need charts and statistics to stand by the free market, or even property itself. 

(l)ibertarian of course carries with it various connotations, including snarky European leftists who get all mad when you "pirate" the word, as well as those who advocate statelessness who think it implies minarchism.  Still, I don't mind it as shorthand -- it covers the basic thrust of the principles even if the specifics are a bit muddy.

I have used the term "propertarian statelessness" before to describe what I advocate, awkward though the term is, because I find it washes away the line of inquiry which tends to proceed from other terms.

I advocate property ("Propertarian") so I'm not "that kind" of anarchist, but I'm also not a minarchist ("statelessness").  Largely I regard the state as a sort of an occultish/new age thought form which has manifested via mass, consensual hallucination.  To that extent, battling it is like battling an angry ghost.  Debating about its existence is interesting in a magazine, but not of much use when it's taking your shit or putting you in a cage.

It is, nonetheless, something that has manifested out of the darkest human impulses -- in particular, cowardice.  At the root of the state hallucination and those who will it into existence by treating it as real, is a fear of people -- a fear of what your next door neighbor might do.

As such you build an idol and worship it and its flags, and pray to it every 4 years to bonk all the things that go bump in the night on their heads - terr'rists and Mexicans and such.  

They open their wallets to buy it guns, complain about it endlessly, then open their wallet again.  Much like Catholics who keep complaining about, you know, the pedo fuckfest the church is but keep throwing money in the basket every weekend. Got-dang are you my favorite person on reddit.

Wouldn't this require a democratic process? 

How would laws over a certain region be enforced? What's to say that a law is enforceable? Im sure this has been asked before, but I can't really find a good answer to this. 
My dad posed the situation: I decide that I want to play music at my house as loudly as I want, all the time. This gets annoying to you, but it's my property and I'll do what ever I damn well please. This annoys all the neighbors around you, but I just refuse to turn down my music. Now, it's not infringing on your property because it's not being harmed in any way, so why should I stop playing music?
And hell, you're not allowed on my property either because it's my property and you, or anyone else can't trespass. 
How would something like this be handled in an Anarcho Capitalist/voluntary society? 


Basic property rights are probably going to be in the answers of a lot of you, but what exactly is a basic property right?   Your example is a good one and can be settled through a number of methods that don't necessarily require a government.  It could be a homeowners association, a community group chosen to represent the people of that community with issues of conflict, or it could be a gathering of citizens that regularly meet at townhalls to discuss issues and resolve them.  

Also, it should be pointed out that just because you have an AnCap society doesn't mean there aren't laws.  Its just less of them or the laws are natural common sense results of a more over arching governing law such as the Golden Rule of libertarians and / or the NAP.  You have the right to do what you want as long as what you are doing does not effect the property, life or well being of another individual.  Playing loud music all the time, preventing me from getting sleep and effecting my ability to work or have a mentally stable environment in which to live can be prosecuted if I can prove that the acts of the other person have caused me some "damages".  If, by whatever means the society choses to resolve the conflict, as described above, a settlement will be made.  

If that doesn't work out, I'm sure the residents effected by the noise will find another way to "resolve" the issue with the offending party.   I like this answer. But this entails into the law's question. How would that be enforced? And how would we get the defendant (music blaster) to appear in court? Lets just say he doesn't want to and he just stays in his property?
Could the community just shut down his power? That's one answer I can see. I'd like to point out that even in today's monopoly legal system, a SIGNIFICANT number of prosecutions do not have the accused present, and more so in minor, civil cases, such as, noise pollution. In this case, the court will normally proceed with the case against and simply no defense will be presented. I like this answer. But this entails into the law's question. How would that be enforced? And how would we get the defendant (music blaster) to appear in court? Lets just say he doesn't want to and he just stays in his property?
Could the community just shut down his power? That's one answer I can see. Quite possibly because he would be found guilty in abstention because he didnt show up.  Beyond that, it depends on the ruling.  More than likely the power being cut off would probably require a couple times not showing up.  But the better approach would be suing in civil court for damages and having his pay or bank accounts docked to pay for the damages.  That will more than likely get the change to occur.  And like I said, eventually, if this person just will not cooperate, the residents effected by the situation will more than likely take matters into their own hands.  

For me I would rent huge spot lights to flood his house with light as bright as the sun all night long or something that I know would greatly upset him.     There are NO laws in an anarchist society. By definition. 0 laws.

Since all exchange in free society is voluntary, if he is truly a constant and reprehensible nuisance then he will find it harder and harder to do trade with his neighbor or even outright shunned. With an open and free exchange of information others will know about the complaints against him. He may be offered a contract of some kind that prohibits him creating noise, in exchange for something else. His property rights could be denied by his neighbors (not saying this falls within what is moral or ethical, but if he has cut all ties from society this could be the final result and he would have no recourse.) 

Ask yourself this-- How would the Amish deal with this?

Property is what can reasonably be defended. That's a good working definition. &amp;gt; There are NO laws in an anarchist society. By definition. 0 laws.

Not necessarily. There are no *rulers* in an anarchy. There can be laws without rulers though. From Merriam-Webster.
Definition of ANARCHY
1
a : absence of government
b : a state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence of governmental authority
c : a utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government
2
a : absence or denial of any authority or established order
b : absence of order : disorder 

Notice that the subheadings are reliant on one another. Notice too that definition a) does not necessitate absence of law. As I said, there are no rulers in an anarchy. There can be laws without rulers though. 1a and 1b ARE reliant on one another. They are not separate definitions.

I think you are confusing "rules" with "laws". 

wikipedia

Law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior.[2] Laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures. 

"Enforcement" of a law necessitates government... Hence "govern" behavior. &amp;gt; They are not separate definitions.

They are. To persuade yourself that this is true look at the entry for farm. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/farm Look at item 5. 

&amp;gt;a : a plot of land devoted to the raising of animals and especially domestic livestock

&amp;gt;b : a tract of water reserved for the artificial cultivation of some aquatic life form &amp;lt;a fish farm&amp;gt;

Any instance of b is also an instance of a. But a does not equate to b. ie. a farm can be an a, without being a b. Just as anarchy can be 'absence of government' without being 'a state of lawlessness or political disorder'. Again, "Enforcement" of a law necessitates government... Hence "govern" behavior.
A and B are reliant on one another because B specifically states "due to absence of government authority." Not because they are subheadings, but I do see how that could be suggested by my wording.

Again, the concept of law depends on the concept of government.

 &amp;gt;Again, "Enforcement" of a law necessitates government.

False. See The Machinery of Freedom, or Chaos Theory for more detail.

&amp;gt;A and B are reliant on one another because B specifically states "due to absence of government authority."

Not so. As I already explained, B implies A. But A does not imply B. Just as with the farm example.

&amp;gt; Again, the concept of law depends on the concept of government.
Again, false. See the references. All definitions of law I can find refer to laws being obligatory and dependent on some authority. Excluding law as in the sense of the invariable relation of phenomena as in science. Perhaps you would care to share another source? Certainly in the popular conception when people speak of laws they assume authority of some kind.   Well, things like this could be contractual. For example, when you buy a house, the contract could stipulate that you couldn't blast loud music 24/7. Violating the contract would be fraud, as well as violation of your own "conditional ownership," and there could be appropriate punishment. This is true and a good case. But not all contracts would state that. So  imagine that wasn't the case. Let's just say that because this is my property, I can do this. What then?      The point is property (and law) can be logically derived from the basic premises that humans act, and equality under the law.  In your example, it doesn't take much thought to understand that blasting music in the neighborhood is intruding into peoples space.   But it goes the other way around too, if you had a place in the country, and you were blasting music daily for years, and then somebody comes along and builds a bunch of houses, then you wouldn't be intruding on their space.   It's a silly scenario I know, but its the one that my dad threw at me and I couldn't counteract it.  How often does your dad call the cops in a given year, just out of curiosity? I have never witnessed him call the police. I know he's done it once or twice about serious things, but thats it.   What is a basic property right?  Once conception is that it's a norm justifiable without contradiction:

Here's a forum I started to specifically discuss the philosophy behind property rights, and ethics in general:

http://intentionalworldview.com/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=11  The same people that make decisions about who we date/marry, what job we take and where we live will make the rules about what food we eat, what doctor we attend and whether it's necessary to come to a full stop at a stop sign.  This one is semi-related, it's a good one to watch, though. It essentially details security (military, police, etc.) Also, Bob Murphy is a good guy.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0_Jd_MzGCw   &amp;gt; Basic and elementary I know, but who would make the laws and how would they be enforced? Wouldn't this require a democratic process?

Common law never developed through a democratic process.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law

&amp;gt; Common law, also known as case law or precedent, is law developed by judges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals, as opposed to statutes adopted through the legislative process or regulations issued by the executive branch.[1]

Where do "similar tribunals" come from if they aren't appointed or elected by the sovereign?  Perhaps the same place medicine, food, shelter etc comes from?  Unless those are trivial matters that the market can be trusted with, and law is just too important, of course...

&amp;gt; This annoys all the neighbors around you, but I just refuse to turn down my music. Now, it's not infringing on your property because it's not being harmed in any way

Sound is the transmission of energy through sonic waves; I'm pretty sure if its loud enough it can damage all kinds of property.

But I get what you're saying, who will sort out petty arguments between neighbours, right?  Well, chances are very good that we've previously agreed to an arbitration platform for such matters if we are neighbours, but in terms of the order of claims, it's based on who got there first and what they homesteaded - if you were there first, jamming your music, you would have homesteaded the right to blast that many decibels around the place, otherwise not.     &amp;gt;Now, it's not infringing on your property because it's not being harmed in any way

He is denying the peaceful use of your property. He is effectively screaming in your ear, and pretending he isn't harming you because he isn't touching you. Failing to call this assault or violence is absurd.

The solution is to use as much force as necessary to get him to stop. Perhaps a group of homeowners continue to pester him about the noise. They stop by whenever he makes noise, perhaps they go so far as to cut power to his house to stop the noise, and it could theoretically lead to physical violence, but if done right this should ultimately be the noisemaker's choice. If the nearby homeowners belong to a DRO, the DRO may take similar step on their behalf.

I've had experience with people like this on more than one occasion, and even though they were completely unwilling to cooperate, it took little pressure to get them to comply, but consistency and level-headedness paid off. These people have acted similarly to bullies. They either want to upgrade to physical violence or they collapse when they meet resistance.</snippet></document><document><title>Krugman Logic</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/ODiZqqJ.jpg</url><snippet>  I do not believe the government has any right to ban people from working below a certain wage. However I think he is basically right. The vast majority of workers work well above minimum wage right now (partially as a result of inflation over the years). Raising the minimum wage will likely cause some unemployment and some prices to rise. But moving the minimum wage to 9 dollars seems unlikely to have a great effect. Of course if the minimum wage was raised to a high number (say 15 dollars or something) the affect would be very negative. This is exactly right. And before we circle jerk all over krugman's face let's not forget that he blamed high unemployment in Europe on wages being set higher than the market clearing price.

And before we circle jerk all over krugman's face let's not forget that he blamed high unemployment in Europe on wages being set higher than the market clearing price.

The problem won't be an immediate one, but rather something that will end up affecting us as younger generations who would normally be getting jobs at minimum wage are unable to get those jobs because the labor costs too much, and they will be unable to develop higher level employment skills. This will probably have the effect that leaves us with higher prices in the future since the supply of decent labor is smaller. The funny thing about this is also that when it comes time for us to collect from our government required ponzi scheme (you know, the one we are paying into now to pay out the people who were forced to pay into it their entire lives) the labor base will probably be producing significantly less than it could had minimum wage not gone up (or existed at all) which will leave a smaller tax base, which will require even more inflation for the gov't to wiggle out of that financial responsibility. Unintended consequences abound. It would be simpler just to let wages clear where they need to clear (ie no wage laws) and address the problems of getting rid of social security and just get rid of it.

Well, it's not contradictory if the prevailing wage of low-skill labor is higher than the minimum wage, I suppose... Well, it's not contradictory if the prevailing wage of low-skill labor is higher than the minimum wage, I suppose... What does "prevailing wage" mean? The average? In that case, people who are below average will be affected, and it will be contradictory. You can't lump everyone into one "prevailing wage" category.  Krugman is a cheerleader for the democratic party first and economist second. Turns out being a cheerleader wins out about 95% of the time when he is talking.   Right?! I feel like his Times column is just telling the liberal reader base what they want to hear. The frequent intellectual dishonesty and total, open, unashamed political bias in his column really disturbs me. If you would like to look at a sociologically oriented explanation of why the mainstream media, without any coercion by the state, repeatedly and consistently serves the interests of the state at every turn, I direct you and all other readers here to the writings of [Mencius Moldbug](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/), particularly [this piece about what he calls the Cathedral](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/06/ol8-reset-is-not-revolution.html). C.S. Lewis said some pretty interesting things about academia, too, in *The Abolition of Man*.

I'm not a Christian, but, man, is it worth reading Lewis. Right?! I feel like his Times column is just telling the liberal reader base what they want to hear. The frequent intellectual dishonesty and total, open, unashamed political bias in his column really disturbs me. Krugman is a cheerleader for the democratic party first and economist second. Turns out being a cheerleader wins out about 95% of the time when he is talking.   He's an economist?    Most of the literature on the minimum wage is muddled with the facts of labor demand and it's almost complete inelasticity and labor supply's very high elasticity. Businesses hire and fire largely based on how much service they need to provide or how much labor they need to run, and will always pass the costs on to consumers. The labor supply changes drastically for any given change in labor price, given everyone's want for higher income.

Set the minimum wage way too high, and sure, lots of people will enter the labor force and unemployment rates will skyrocket, but relatively few jobs will be lost. It's a problem of supply exceeding demand.

Set the minimum wage low and below the market rates and nothing is going to happen. Employers wouldn't dare lower pay for risk of losing labor, and nobody new is attracted to the labor force because labor price hasn't changed.

The result is that the literature concludes the minimum wage has almost no effect on employment because minimum wages have strategically been raised so as to not be too high.

Basically, I know we all love to joke about Krugman for calling for alien invasions, but he isn't being contradictory or stupid. What he is implying is that the minimum wage can be raised without distorting the market, which the literature on the minimum wage currently supports as a theory. "The result is that the literature concludes the minimum wage has almost no effect on employment because minimum wages have strategically been raised so as to not be too high."

"Strategically" I like that. Because we know politicians teamed with massive bureaucracies are known to... act "strategically," indeed.

Then a simple question. What is that level of minimum wage that has significant enough negative effects? At what labor price do you pick and how do you decide that? The answer to that question would expose the significant flaws of any given approach to answer that question. Inevitably and uncreatively the government could get on it's knee's and try to grope (just raise it until something goes wrong then stop there and maybe lower it a bit, but such a process involves continuous over and understeps by definition and is not particularly adaptive to future  large dynamic changes in the economic system.

 If you don't have a method to functionally answer that question, how can you meaningfully and purposefully act on the above mentioned theory and how exactly can you falsify any given minimum wage raise from beyond an economic point where it is trivial (arguable at what precise level this is globally, as we all know very small changes and differences can push the economy "over an unseen edge," the problem for them is its functionally impossible to actually "trace" an exact causal chain from small things like that. So we ignore it because we do not have the effective resolution to percieve it's significance.. thus it doesn't mean anything.

Ofcourse it is a big political football.    I'd like to upvote, but there is a theoretical basis for "market failure" in monopsony. That being said, governments can't actually fix it. &amp;gt;there is a theoretical basis for "market failure"

I disagree:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18l91h/calling_the_irs/c8g47lj?context=3 Have you read monopsony theory? I understand that under particular conditions of elasticity, the typical price/quantity relationship does not obtain, and that raising (for example) the minimum wage might not lead to a change in quantity of labor traded.

I'm just objecting to the description of this situation as "market failure".  The problem here, for me, is the conception that human labor is only a mere good, a commodity like any other, whose price and *percieved* value are determined by markets. Does Anarcho-Capitalism recognize any intrinsic value in human productive activities? Do individuals have the right to labor, not as an exchange in the market, but as a fundamental act of man to create meaning?   You have the right to do anything you wish as long as you do not violate the rights of anyone else. If you wish to labour, for whatever reason including no reason at all, I doubt any anarcho-capitalist would have any issues whatsoever.

Anarcho-capitalism doesn't recognises any intrinsic value of anything, as it recognises the subjective theory of value - things only have value inasmuch as individuals deem they do.

EDIT: Please don't downvote undergradgnome. It was a completely reasonable question. So individuals are the only thing with intrinsic value? I assume they would have to be seeing as their judgments create the values of other things. It seems impossible that an individual who can create the value (by his own estimation) of any other object, even the labor of another person, cannot or does not have intrinsic value. Sorry I am not familiar with Anarcho-Capitalism, and am just asking questions. Thanks! Value is only meaningful when talking about how much individuals value something. Something doesn't have value in and of itself - it might be valued *by* someone, though.

A loaf of bread is just a bunch of molecules. It has no "value" anywhere. An individual might see that loaf of bread and *perceive* that it is of value, but that is all in that person's head - the loaf of bread hasn't gained any "value" or anything. We might say that the loaf of bread has value, but that's just a shorthand meaning that "most people perceive loaves of bread as valuable".

To take a example where human labour is involved: say someone is a singer. In and of itself, it is just a person making noise. One person might perceive that noise as of value, and thus the labour necessary to produce that noise (ie. singing) as of value. In just the same way, someone else might *not* think that the singing is of value. In either case, it is not the singing itself that is valuable or not - value is entirely in how people perceive it.

Hope that makes sense. So individuals are the only thing with intrinsic value? I assume they would have to be seeing as their judgments create the values of other things. It seems impossible that an individual who can create the value (by his own estimation) of any other object, even the labor of another person, cannot or does not have intrinsic value.

Does Anarcho-Capitalism recognize any intrinsic value in human productive activities? Do individuals have the right to labor, not as an exchange in the market, but as a fundamental act of man to create meaning?   But when we're talking about wages, we're not talking about labor, but merely the value of that labor.  Any really only the value of the labor when it is transacted with a business owner who owns the work product of the laborer per their contract.  

I may create meaning by farming.  Wages would have no direct impact on my ability to farm my land and then trade those goods with neighbors.  No one has infringed upon a fundamental act of man to create meaning. Wages are the price of labor, not the value?
True the context of the conversation was wages, but my original comment refers to the way of thinking about human labor (which is what the wage buys) as a good, as a commodity. I find this problematic as I think it undercuts the autonomy and integrity of the individual; if a man is thought of as a machine, bred as a machine, lives the life of a machine, is he not a machine? I am sorry though I am not familiar with Anarcho-Capitalism, I have been exploring here and learning a lot!

Why don't we let him run the global economy by himself? I'm pretty sure he knows what I want better than I do and we could all be employed. Death to the robots! Hurray for states! Krugman is so smart. Why don't we let him run the global economy by himself? I'm pretty sure he knows what I want better than I do and we could all be employed. Death to the robots! Hurray for states!  There's no evidence that if A is true, and B is true, then (A and B) is true.  He did say "other things being equal."  A standard intellectual escape clause. Um... it's not an "*escape clause*." If you say that higher prices *always* lead to lower demand then you're just wrong. It is an escape clause.  Escape clauses can be correct. "*Escape clause*" sounds very negative. If you didn't mean it that way then I just misinterpreted your comment. Yep.  I'm just saying, he could be not contradicting himself.  But it makes you wonder what Krugman thinks the "other things" are that make this not apply to minimum wage. Yep.  I'm just saying, he could be not contradicting himself.  But it makes you wonder what Krugman thinks the "other things" are that make this not apply to minimum wage. Yep.  I'm just saying, he could be not contradicting himself.  But it makes you wonder what Krugman thinks the "other things" are that make this not apply to minimum wage. in the real world, *nothing* else is equal. That's why he goes by empirical evidence. If we throw out ceteris paribus logical comparisons, then empirical evidence must be relegated to purely historical analysis, not used as a tool to predict future outcomes. Why ? I don't see how it is possible to completely discard empirical evidence. Empirical evidence gives us an isolated snapshot of past reality. All data is in the past. We can certainly analyze that data without requiring ceteris paribus logical comparisons. However since conditions in the future will necessarily be somewhat different than conditions in the past, we can't accurately claim that because X happened in the past, X will happen in the future.

In order to make predictions about the future, based on past events, we have to make some concessions about our claims. Because X happened in the past, *if all other things remain equal* then X will happen in the future. We can make provisional statements like that, but without the ceteris paribus clause it doesn't logically follow from past empirical evidence.

To be clear, I don't think it *is* possible to disregard empirical evidence when predicting the future. It's inescapable. Of course when we do so we need to make those ceteris paribus assumptions. So if Poop_is_Food's claim "in the real world, nothing else is equal" were true, then we wouldn't be able to make any predictions about the future whatsoever. If we throw out ceteris paribus logical comparisons, then empirical evidence must be relegated to purely historical analysis, not used as a tool to predict future outcomes. I dont think he is throwing them completely away. He did say "other things being equal."  A standard intellectual escape clause. </snippet></document><document><title>The cyberspace is a dictator's worst nightmare</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18qppq/the_cyberspace_is_a_dictators_worst_nightmare/</url><snippet>*You go to Gmail.com to create an account.

The Internet is a wasteland of creativity and efficiency. Any action is fiercely regulated and anything you do is being recorded by the state.*

The above scenario is, as of February 18, 2013, pretty much false. But this is where we're headed, provided states across the world realize the power the cyberspace has. 

The cyberspace transgresses state borders; it fosters cooperation(e.g., telecommuting); it is fertile ground for creativity. And these are just a few of the reasons the cyberspace is the dictator's worst nightmare.

The only reason the cyberspace is still somewhat out of the reach of the state is because, bluntly put, regulators are idiots. Most regulators grew up in a world where the cyberspace didn't exist. How can you regulate something you don't even understand?

     For less than $20 per month, anybody and their mother can get a virtual machine on the internet (now using bitcoin), and run whatever services they want, wherever they want on the planet, without permission.   I think that even the scenario you describe will be difficult to impose.   Just look at how much luck the copyright cartels have had stopping pre-teen kids from listening to songs and seeing movies.  Even with the full force of the state, they have pretty much gotten nowhere.  

The real issue is control, and the age where government controls people by controlling the information is over, forever.   You can't shoot info with a tank.   While a state may have the power to control people, contorting information is extremely hard, especially in a hyper-networked world.  Countries that are a lot less free, and a lot more violent than the USA are having problems.    Can you help me understand the advantages of an online virtual machine as it relates to security? Or can you provide a link?  I would say it is almost the other way around. Crypto is hard. It used to be that the opposition meet in coffee houses and simular events. To control that the stat needs a huge apperatues of people that controll other people (like stasi).

At the moment we see tons of goverments investing (or forcing others to invest) in a huge network of deep package inspection. With this is is possible to even change every website somebody goes to. With control of the internet like this you do not have to be afraid of SSL anymore because its easy to put false certificates to people.

It is true that there are tools like Tor, TrueCrypt and RSA but using those is hard, and you using it is hard. If you use those are automaticlly in the list because normal people 'have nothing to hide'.

It is true that regulating the internet is hard, deepening on what you want to do but monitoring it is quite easy.

Disagree. It is because it is impossible to regulate.

We accept as a given that we don't kidnap, beat, steal from, threaten or coerce those within our social groups, knowing that we will be barred from the group, left without friends and face possible retaliation. These are basic social principles we are taught as children. Why is it hard to imagine applying these principles outside of your social life?

The point is, we see it as wrong to kidnap, beat, rob, defraud and control people through violence and fear. These are common views; the difference is we believe in applying these principles consistently and don't believe in suspending these principles for a coercive central authority who claims ownership over everyone within a geographical area. Everything else in relation to an ancap society are details that we can't predict. We can look at it from an abstract position and say there will be more competition in the market resulting in cheaper prices, more efficiency, higher employment, more choices etc, but there's no way to make any specific predictions about the finer details. So how is Anarcho-Capitalism different from Anarchism generally?

Isn't this just Anarchism?   You ever watch the Jetsons? Something like that.

In all seriousness though, I assume you're talking about legal system specifically, because that the defining feature of anarcho-capitalism. You could expect competing security service providers and a bunch of private arbitrators.

Oh, and you could also expect gold to be money. What is a private arbitrator? If I recall Locke it is crucial to have society as an arbitrator between two parties; elaborate on a private arbitrator if you would.  "Society" in not a person, and therefore can't act as an arbitrator.

A private arbitrator would be someone who just works as an arbitrator, like a judge on a case. If two people have a dispute in society and want to settle a matter, they can go to this arbitrator and agree to abide by his decision.

Here, watch this video as a great example of how that can all work.

[Law Without Government](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRkBEdSDDo) I have a few questions.

Let's say Person A has a problem with Person B so he brings him to an arbitrator to hear the case. The arbitrator hears the case and sides with Person A. Well Person B does not agree with the ruling and won't abide by it. B could find his own arbitrator and that person could rule in favor of B. Now there are two conflicting rulings. Even if they go to a third arbitrator randomly picked and the "loser" does not feel they have to accept the ruling, what happens?

Let's say Person A and B are before an arbitrator and rules in favor of A and in this system whoever loses has to pay the arbitrator so as not to bias the arbitrator toward the person who sought him out and paid him upfront. What if the person the arbitrator rules against refuses to pay the arbitrator's fee? How would the arbitrator go about collecting his fee? Not like the arbitrator can bring the person to another arbitrator, present his case and have that arbitrator rule in his favor and demand the person pay the arbitrator because that person just won't follow the ruling. What happens?

And a final question based off the video you provided. There are three people; A, B and C. A and B get into a dispute and C will be the arbitrator. C rules in favor of B and A goes along with it. Now there is a dispute between B and C and A is the arbitrator. To get back at C for ruling against him earlier, A finds in favor of B. How is that prevented? So for the first part, you're essentially asking what will keep someone from going to arbitrator after arbitrator.

Well, first off, the point of Person A and Person B agreeing to go to an arbitrator was because they wanted to solve this issue in a non-violent way. Rejecting the ruling of an arbitrator would essentially put them back to where they were in the first place.

Secondly, ignoring the ruling when you had agreed to abide by their decision will absolutely destroy any kind of reputation you had in this society. Not only will you be seen as someone who does not accept arbitration, but as untrustworthy in general (not to mention that everyone now suspects you're guilty of whatever the problem was). You'll suddenly find it a lot harder to contract with people.

Thirdly, let's say that each Person A and Person B had their own rights enforcement agencies to come to their defense. If their client is found guilty of whatever crime the dispute was over, they will step down and no longer defend them, maybe arresting the client themselves or letting the other organization handle it. Point is, they stop defending the guy. Now you might be wondering why these guys don't follow the same problem of going to arbitrator after arbitrator, and that's mainly thanks to two things. First off, the stakes are much higher for going to all out war with this other group and they wouldn't want to do that over some small dispute, war is *very* costly. And the other reason is thanks to the discipline of constant dealings. While Person A or B might only being going to court this once in their entire life, these agencies have an entire career made on bringing people to court. They know that they're going to have thousands of similar cases with this, maybe even with the same other agency, so keeping their reputation clean is absolutely *vital* to their existence.

As for your second question, many of the things above apply. Not paying would be detrimental to reputation, and rights enforcement agencies could enforce the payment if push comes to shove.

And for your final question, in a three person society this becomes pretty difficult. C might know that A is biased against him and reject working with him in the first place, so if A really seems like that biased of a person, he loses customers. Fortunately, this problem becomes a lot easier to handle in a modern society with many, many people who can compete for the position of arbitrator. Not only is your problem a lot less likely than it is to happen in a 3 person society, but we now have different options to go to, and these groups must compete with each other, with those with the best reputation getting the most customers.

The Law Without Government series has two more videos, in case you did not see them. I'll link them below as well as some other videos I think will help you.

I'm very much in favor of the arbitrator style conflict resolution, it's just that when pressed about my support for it, I don't have the best answers to back it up or at least answers that won't satisfy the person asking questions.

For example, I said if the arbitrator rules against B and B doesn't abide by it then other businesses can shut him out and not do business with him. The person asking me questions asked what if not all the businesses would stop doing business with him. I responded then other people will not do business with those businesses because they are catering to those who skirt around the rulings. He said other people who may want to avoid the rulings by the arbitrator will keep going to that business and keep it afloat because they know at least one business will still be there for them if they avoid the ruling. So I wasn't sure exactly how to respond. What is a private arbitrator? If I recall Locke it is crucial to have society as an arbitrator between two parties; elaborate on a private arbitrator if you would.  You ever watch the Jetsons? Something like that.

In all seriousness though, I assume you're talking about legal system specifically, because that the defining feature of anarcho-capitalism. You could expect competing security service providers and a bunch of private arbitrators.

Oh, and you could also expect gold to be money.   Well, for one thing, hookers and blow would be cheaper.           </snippet></document><document><title>Eric Holder: Banning Home-Schooling Does Not Violate Fundamental Rights (x-post from /r/homeschool and /r/conservative</title><url>http://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2013/02/eric-holder-banning-homeschooling-doesnt-violate-fundamental-rights/</url><snippet>  If there was an Olympic sport for mental gymnastics, the statists would win Gold.   Free thinking is dangerous.  Imagine what the world would look like if instead of rote memorization of state mandated facts, we guided kids to learn from the world around them by immersion.  Imagine if instead of being taught what the colonies war of secession was per a textbook, children actually were helped to find accounts of the war from multiple angles to understand most of the true issues at the time.  These exercises lead to understanding problems before jumping into them... thinking about the world in an analog and not binary fashion.  These are dangerous to the status quo. &amp;gt;These are dangerous to the status quo.

True, but it is the majority of the species' own lack of critical thinking that has *created* what we see, not necessarily that it was designed.

It's just a cycle of generational ignorance, the blind leading the blind. True... but that's where competition comes into play.  Homeschooling is starting to gain traction from what I've observed.  Private schools are slowly changing to adopt a more flexible model.  The world is slowly changing. &amp;gt;The world is slowly changing.

I'm not so sure, not in a fundamental sense.  I do see the internet as unlocking *those who do have a critical capacity*, but I don't think it necessarily follows those who do not have such a mind will become critical.

I think we're just undergoing a superficial change with minor liberation.  I think the organism will have to experience something radical biologically before we can talk about fundamental political change. I used to homeschool and now my daughter attends private school.  We've looked at the options over the years and they've changed significantly over the past 10 years.

Previously the private schools mirrored the structure of the public schools.  The curriculum looked the same, the kids had 6 classes a day, 50-60 minutes per class, homework, etc.  The real difference was that your kid was going to school with other kids who had parents who cared enough and had the means to send their kid to a private school.  The teachers tended to be better as it was easier to fire them.

While much of this is still true today, with the competition from home schoolers, private schools where I live have changed.  

There are two which offer radically different models where it's self paced and computer guided education with a teacher there to help.  Kids who are excellent at math and science can zip through 2 classes a year, and spend more time on languages if that's where they need more help.

There are also schools which cater to different learning styles, making big adaptations for ADHD kids.  They have smaller class sizes, use electronic whitenoise generators to help focus, rotate subjects more rapidly.  

Then you have a couple schools which work with homeschoolers where they do their core subjects at home, but sign up for classroom classes in more advanced subjects that their parents aren't able to teach.  Take math and history at home, but go to the academy for Chemistry and British Lit.  

Then there are a few homeschool coops which take that approach to a grassroots level.  I'm an engineer who is good with math and science... I can teach that to kids... but my grammar and writing skills aren't so great.  But there are parents who have a natural talent in those areas.  So you all pitch in and bring the kids together twice a week for classes which you don't feel comfortable teaching at home.  

And of course you have your typical college prep school which mirrors public school with a different set of kids and teachers.  

Personally I've seen this gain quite a bit of momentum over the past 5 years.  Of course I live in a part of the country where opening a new school is simple... government actually gets out of our way in this area. &amp;gt;Of course I live in a part of the country where opening a new school is simple... government actually gets out of our way in this area.

Where's that? Texas.  The requirements for what you must teach a homeschool student are that you must teach: Reading, Spelling, Grammar, Mathematics, A study of good citizenship.  They don't dictate what constitutes those subjects or how often they must be taught.  

Private schools are free from regulation and follow the same guidelines as a homeschool.  I could start a private school here tomorrow. Yeah, I'm considering coming down there after I finish my ChemE.  We'll see how it goes.  I'm no where near beginning the comparative state analysis (leave it to engineers to hyperanalyze every life decision into charts and variables) yet though, but TX is definitely one of the first to come to mind. I moved here 6 years ago and had spreadsheets for analyzing property appreciation rates, tax burden, overall cost of living... so I know what you mean!  

There are a lot of engineering jobs in Texas, on the high tech side as well as the petroleum side.  I'd guess that a ChemE would find a job easier in Houston than most other places.  One advantage of Houston as a libertarian is that there are no real zoning laws.

All in all I like it here in Texas, as much as an an-cap could like living in a state.  Property taxes are high (roughly 2.25% of home value), but real estate is significantly cheaper than most other major metro areas... you can get a newer 2000 sqft 3 bed/2 bath brick rancher for $140k which could go for $400k in CA or $300k in DC.  

There is no income tax, so if you are a minimum wage worker, it's not much of a savings for lower income folks.  However if you are an engineer or other high wage earner, dual wage earner family, it's a huge savings.  My wife and I both work in IT earning good salaries, so factoring in all taxes, we save about $12k a year in taxes versus living in Virginia.

The only downside to me is that the secession movement really is a bunch of theocrats.  Religion is a big deal in Texas and people really want to legislate with their religion in mind.  I personally don't care if people like to spend most of their week at church, however it can be a bit obnoxious when the public school has a Christmas chorus event at the local Baptist church and sings songs about Jesus being the Savior.  My daughter's Jewish friend was conflicted about being in the chorus (actually called choir here, appropriately enough) because he really didn't want to sing Jesus songs.... but wanted to sing.   True... but that's where competition comes into play.  Homeschooling is starting to gain traction from what I've observed.  Private schools are slowly changing to adopt a more flexible model.  The world is slowly changing. I'd like to be well off enough to homeschool my children if I have any.  I'd probably lose my mind after having to deal with the never ending bs I read about when it comes to children and education.   </snippet></document><document><title>Net neutrality: what&#8217;s a libertarian to do?</title><url>http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=617</url><snippet>  If the internet provider market was free, the net-nuetral ones would attract all the customers if that is what they cared about.

but the provider market is not free, so i think its best to support the stance of liberty, which is net neutrality. Absolutely not! The problem with every net neutrality bill to date is that it injects more government into the system. They put language into internet usage such as "legal", which implies that illegal traffic can be throttled or blocked. That means they will be snooping through our traffic to see what we're downloading. After all, the government wants to make sure we're not downloading illegal child porn or sharing illegal videos, thats the work of terrorists!

Your position was mentioned in the article. He said you're trying to re-slice the existing pie. You're exhausting yourself on fighting yesterdays battle. The solution to the problem is to leave government out of the new technologies. If the new ventures get regulated, then the big players just gobble everything up and we're back at the status quo.

It's important to remember that what the government terms Patriot Act or Net Neutrality, is the exact opposite of what they really mean. You're not getting liberty ever through regulation. you can support net neutrality, without supporting the current proposed bills. i think a bill that actually focused on personal liberty could overcome many of these issues.

it seems to me the government can already spy on us, without any new bills.

ultimately, my feelings is this would be a non-issue with a free market in internet providers. &amp;gt; i think a bill that actually focused on personal liberty could overcome many of these issues.

So what would be a bill like this look like? Government that gives people liberty is taking it from someone else first. 

&amp;gt; ultimately, my feelings is this would be a non-issue with a free market in internet providers.

I agree. Our goal as libertarians should be total de-regulation to a free market. Thats why he said in the article to watch for debates where the government is trying to add new regulations onto new technologies. Our energy is best spent in these areas, because arguing politics with NN supporters is hopeless.  thats a damn good question. probably why i am not employed in writing libertarian bills. i havnt seen any of the proposed bills, but i would imagine they are longer than they have to be, and contain mostly shit that does not have to do with individual liberty. If the internet provider market was free, the net-nuetral ones would attract all the customers if that is what they cared about.

but the provider market is not free, so i think its best to support the stance of liberty, which is net neutrality.   </snippet></document><document><title>Thin Twice Bits - Liberty Media Frenzy. </title><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY1f9ensS5s</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Why the free market fundamentalists think 2013 will be the best year ever</title><url>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/17/free-market-fundamentalists-think-2013-best</url><snippet>  Let's see who can spot the most logical fallacies in this article and the comments.

&amp;gt;The epistemolic issue with terminology or meaning does not invalidate or undermines all those decades of politcal and economic struggle the 20th century had: invalidating Post-capitalism of soviet type does not validate capitalism as a natural, absolute cosmic force that will exist for all eternity, discussions like these are not productive, they are absolute waste of time and self-illusion; it does not save capitalism morally - it does not undermine the necessity to transcend capitalism and stabilish a true socialist order, as Marx stablished in general lines: a society made of freely associated producers, and this we all can see was not the case of Soviet Union, is not the case of China, we don't need to change the terminology to see that empirically.

This is how today's apologists for the market, in an unheard-of ideological kidnapping, explain the crisis of 2008: it was not the failure of the free market that caused it, but the excessive state regulation; the fact that our market economy was not a true one, ...

Sigh.   There were a lot of very specific things that the federal government and the federal reserve did, that we explicitly told them not to do, and explicitly said would have the consequences that they did.    I guess now that they are printing up shitloads of money to uh "fix it" ... when that causes things to go to hell they will blame that on the market too.

I have learned that unless one explains their stance, opinion, and intent clearly others will make assumptions or misunderstandings and respond to my questions with undue hostility. The following disclaimers are to, hopefully, prevent that.

Firstly, I come in peace. Forgive me if I come off the wrong way, I do not wish to deface Anarcho-Capitalism and should I come into an argument it is not because I feel you are unintelligent, or that you have failed to present your opinion but rather that I need you to help my clarify my own thoughts and am challenging you to challenge me because I would prefer for you to convince me that Im wrong about something so that I may learn.

As of yet I have never been offered an argument in support of Anarchism. The Anarchists that I have met tend to be one of two people: 1. Violent conspiracy theorists who say "fuck the government I dont trust it," or 2. middle class rebellious children who seek to belong to a movement without understanding it fully.

I personally can not consider myself for or against something until I understand it fully and this is what I am doing here asking those who support Anarcho-Capitalism just as one can not be in support or against a religion without both understanding it as a theory, and it as a body of people. I will not be able to ask all of my questions immediately because there are too many but hopefully this will be a start.

What separates Anarcho-Cappitalism from Anarchism? Is a state of anarchy not the absence of a governing system? If this is the case then how can social order and safety be maintained? Individuals are incapable of their own protection as strength is certainly in numbers. Anarcho-Capitalism defines that a state would be protected by privately funded organizations but how is this any different from government in any way? If organizations are run by humans, and humans can have malicious intents how can all out war between these organizations be prevented? Isn't it natural for people to want to follow the private organization which functions the best, thus causing the failure of other private organizations and resulting in a singular social protector? Is this not how government is created? What is a realistic model for a lasting Anarcho-Capitalist state? As of yet anarchism seems to have less of a realistic goal and instead seems to be more of a "lets just get rid of the government that we have then we will figure it out from there." I can see anarchism only as a utopian ideology but not as an actual possible reality.

 My opinions are based on very loose understanding of the topic in an academic sense and instead on an understanding of how others represent Anarchism. I hope that you can present points that will at least help me understand the Anarcho-Capitalist philosophy.

  &amp;gt; What separates Anarcho-Cappitalism from Anarchism?

Anarchism (i.e. r/anarchism), is more of a socialist/communist movement. You could think of them as anarcho-communists to us being anarcho-capitalists. "Anarchy" is meant to be a non-economic term, but they have a hard time separating economics from politics.

&amp;gt; Is a state of anarchy not the absence of a governing system?

In a more general sense, you could call it any involuntary hierarchy. I say involuntary, because if you willingly accept a leader (i.e. government), thats OK by us. The key here is to not impose your beliefs onto others against their will.

&amp;gt; Individuals are incapable of their own protection as strength is certainly in numbers.

False premise. If you have a gun and "5 Guys" are attacking you with knives, "strength in numbers" isn't necessarily true. Self-defense is a whole topic onto itself here. Wait around long enough and you can join in the discussion. It comes up about once a week on average.

&amp;gt; Anarcho-Capitalism defines that a state would be protected by privately funded organizations but how is this any different from government in any way?

Voluntary association. You get to pick which restaurants you eat at as opposed to have this decision made for you by someone else. The end result is likely the same, but the process of reaching there is peaceful.

&amp;gt; Isn't it natural for people to want to follow the private organization which functions the best, thus causing the failure of other private organizations and resulting in a singular social protector?

If this was true, then why are there so many different hamburger restaurants? I kinda agree with you though, so hopefully we can agree that In&amp;amp;Out burgers are the best and close down everything else. I don't understand how anyone can't love In&amp;amp;Out.

&amp;gt; As of yet anarchism seems to have less of a realistic goal and instead seems to be more of a "lets just get rid of the government that we have then we will figure it out from there."

True. Again though, anyone not loving In&amp;amp;Out hamburgers is simply wrong. It's probably in everyones best interests if we just forcibly close down all the other restaraunts, but as anarcho-capitalists we allow them to find the truth out for themselves, without forcing them. Yes, eventually everything will be In&amp;amp;Out, but it's not hurting anyone to eat garbage from McDonalds or Burger King. They're just missing out and hurting themselves. 

Have you ever ordered your burger animal style?



  Lets put it this way:


What you know about statism is not because somebody convinced you of its efficiency, so there are no "right" arguments against the state, when there were no "right" arguments for the state.

You  and others were born in such a thing, you had 12 years of indoctrination in its institutions, you are their property, and the answer of the ignorant is that it is old and that is why it is good.

The same argument was made for imaginary things, slavery, wife and kid beating and others. 


My easy way to explain ancap is to live the life that you would not mind others living.  But isn't one just as ignorant in claiming that anarchism is good because its not old? because it is new? Was that not the argument of the naive for Communism (which also dosn't seem to work). I have not lived in a state long enough to be indoctrinated by it. If you must know about my past, I have never lived in any one country for more then 5 years and grew up in both Capitalist USA, London, New Zealand, as well as Communist China. I find it very difficult to consider myself belonging to any one state and as a result this is why I strive to hard to formulate my own viewpoints. I view all things critically especially myself and constantly examine my opinions for bias. I make every attempt to remove my emotional self from understanding things and prefer to rely solely on reason. This is why I can not claim that I am against or for or in understanding of Anarcho-Capitalism until I have educated myself on it immensely. Even then I've never held a concrete opinion. Everything I support is very open to change and I have been known to fluctuate in opinion towards matters as I am presented with evidence in ones support. This is why I wish to discuss Anarcho-Capitalism because I wish to open myself to other viewpoints and use the discussion as a medium for me to possible be made aware of points which previous I was not, points which may have the potential either to strengthen my current perspective, or alter my opinions. :) &amp;gt; But isn't one just as ignorant in claiming that anarchism is good because its not old?

Tip: Don't [strawman](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html) your interlocutors. Nobody has suggested that anarchism (or anarcho-capitalism) is a good idea because it's new. Thats not what I intended at all. You presented the point that it is naive for individuals to support the state because it is old and I agreed with you by stating it is equally naive for individuals to support an idea because it is new. That is all. I made no assumptions about your opinions. Im sure that you have reason behind your perspectives. &amp;gt; You presented the point that it is naive for individuals to support the state because it is old

No i didn't. You're confusing me with another user I think.

&amp;gt; I agreed with you by stating it is equally naive for individuals to support an idea because it is new

You posed it as a rhetorical question, which gave the impression of implying that your interlocutor held this position (otherwise why mention it?).

No anarchist will force your kids from very early on to brainwash "anarchy" as that would go against the very principal, so just from that you can predict which one is less aggressive. 


&amp;gt;  I have not lived in a state long enough to be indoctrinated by it. If you must know about my past, I have never lived in any one country for more then 5 years and grew up in both Capitalist USA, London, New Zealand, as well as Communist China.


So you never had to write "beeeeh" in order to pass any exams, even though it was ridiculous? 


&amp;gt;  I find it very difficult to consider myself belonging to any one state and as a result this is why I strive to hard to formulate my own viewpoints. 

I bet nobody ever explained why statism is needed, without using euphemisms.


&amp;gt; I view all things critically especially myself and constantly examine my opinions for bias. I make every attempt to remove my emotional self from understanding things and prefer to rely solely on reason.


Feelings are very reasonable, bad feeling especially. I do not think you are doing a healthy thing. 


&amp;gt; This is why I can not claim that I am against or for or in understanding of Anarcho-Capitalism until I have educated myself on it immensely. 


It is simple, do you consider everyone as equal, or do you think some people deserve to be a higher class based on past justifications?


&amp;gt; Even then I've never held a concrete opinion. Everything I support is very open to change and I have been known to fluctuate in opinion towards matters as I am presented with evidence in ones support.


You cant agree to disagree over broken bones, tax theft, regulation crimes, slavery called conscription and other stuff. 

That is not intellectually honest. 


&amp;gt; This is why I wish to discuss Anarcho-Capitalism because I wish to open myself to other viewpoints and use the discussion as a medium for me to possible be made aware of points which previous I was not, points which may have the potential either to strengthen my current perspective, or alter my opinions. :)


(If) your view starts with statism as normal, and nobody has ever convinced you why it is normal but you just go by reflexes of the past, you will never change your own opinion, because it is not your own opinion to begin with.

In order to learn about ancap, first try to see the contradictions that you already hold. "So you never had to write "beeeeh" in order to pass any exams, even though it was ridiculous?"

Nope never. I've always spoken my true opinion and have been lucky enough to attend institutions which encourage and reward individual thought. 

I most certainly feel that there is nothing perfect about existing government. It has many improvements to make, however, just as Anarchism is an ideology for a utopian world without government I see greater reason to focus on reaching a utopian world with government. Would you be alright with government if it allowed its citizens to choose to leave freely? &amp;gt; Nope never. I've always spoken my true opinion and have been lucky enough to attend institutions which encourage and reward individual thought.


How much choice did you have in choosing these institutions? Or were you forced to follow your parents of wherever they fitted you?


&amp;gt; It has many improvements to make, 


And, why do you think you are protecting the very same institution that never put a clear argument why it is needed?


&amp;gt;I see greater reason to focus on reaching a utopian world with government.


Could you achieve that without force? Without breaking the nap? Without indoctrinating kids for 12 year in a row?

Without force, your utopia is dead, and all you and other only tool is violence to change your view, and I am certain that it was violence when you formed your view. 


&amp;gt; Would you be alright with government if it allowed its citizens to choose to leave freely?


Leave from where? I am not waving any guns or aggression against anybody, so maybe the statist could get out.


If the statists want to fund their own government with their own money, put up their private property to be confiscated if they do not pay state taxes and fines, and sign up for following the state laws voluntarily, than I would be fine with it, but that would no longer be called a state, as the state is the monopoly of legal crime.  No, I have always been presented with a wide variety of options from which to chose. When I was 8 I attended a public school in the USA and I hated the indoctrination as did my parents so they took me on tours of other schools and asked me which ones I liked best. I like the education system of Montessori schools the most because I felt that It allowed for the most interaction. My fathers company would only pay for me to attend a private catholic based school in Shanghai for high school. I attended for one year but again my parents and I were appalled by the education system so they gave me the list of schools in Shanghai and told me to find one which I liked. I picked a smaller, secular, private, but highly liberal and free thought oriented international school. My fathers company would not cover the cost for this so my parents agreed with my decisions and paid for it out of pocket. Despite being one of the highest paid employees of his company my father lives an extremely humble life because he has never accepted company hand outs and has spent nearly 90% of his income on my education. 

I see no reason why my utopia would die without force. Thats a rather pessimistic way to look at it. Simply, I create a state. I am clear in what it means to be a member of that state. Those who wish to join do so, those who wish to leave do so. By being a favorable state I prevent its collapse as people will volunteer to support it. Children are not indoctrinated but rather given an education of free and open thought like I was, thus allowing them to formulate their own view points. Hopefully they will take that opportunity to make improvements to the state should there be any flaws. If they chose not to then so be it. If they fail to make such changes then they have full freedom to leave the state should they choose. 

"And, why do you think you are protecting the very same institution that never put a clear argument why it is needed?" I protect no institution. I do however realize the functionality of a utopian government over a utopian anarchy. 

You have quite a pessimistic view of "the state." Please be wary assigning a definition to the word and assuming that it is concrete for every usage of the word thereafter. I don't really understand "I am not waving any guns or aggression against anybody, so maybe the statist could get out." that comes across as selfishness. What I said reflects quite similarly upon the principles of Anarcho-Capitalism. There are different groups of people with different principles. Those who don't like belonging to a group can leave. OK. In my scenario said group is called the state. It exists an is defined by its members, location, and principles. Those who are members are voluntary members. Those who do not concur are not forced to stay members. You are associating government with inevitable force and what Im saying is that this is not always true and does not have to be true. &amp;gt; No, I have always been presented with a wide variety of options from which to chose. When I was 8 I attended a public school in the USA and I hated the indoctrination as did my parents so they took me on tours of other schools and asked me which ones I liked best.

I picked a smaller, secular, private, but highly liberal and free thought oriented international school. 


And let me guess, the education was statist worshipping because the curriculum must be state approved, and staying at home was not an option with the parents. 


&amp;gt; My fathers company would not cover the cost for this so my parents agreed with my decisions and paid for it out of pocket. Despite being one of the highest paid employees of his company my father lives an extremely humble life because he has never accepted company hand outs and has spent nearly 90% of his income on my education.


He sounds like he came from an ex totalitarian state. And very nice for him for doing his best. 


&amp;gt;  I am clear in what it means to be a member of that state. Those who wish to join do so, those who wish to leave do so.

Are you saying that if you are in an area that 51% want to practice the state, the 49% should leave, or that the 49% can opt out of the services you supply? 


&amp;gt; By being a favorable state I prevent its collapse as people will volunteer to support it.

51% will always vote to take the 49% of money any day. And that is where we are and where we will be eg Japan.


&amp;gt; Children are not indoctrinated


All the credentials are state monopoly, and you are forced to play by that monopoly, that is the technical forceful indoctrination. 


&amp;gt; but rather given an education of free and open thought like I was, thus allowing them to formulate their own view points.


You had a rather good life of being a tax cattle in others tax farm. For the majority of the world living like a tourist is rather hard and expansive. 

The cash is already extracted from all who do not have kids or do not use those services. And with out that coercion statism would die. 

&amp;gt; Hopefully they will take that opportunity to make improvements to the state should there be any flaws.


So in your view the government should be improving every day just as the private sector, and you refuse to see the evidence of what is going on in public sector and the private one. 

&amp;gt; If they fail to make such changes then they have full freedom to leave the state should they choose.


Leave as in you leave a phone contract, or leave as in physically under the barrel of the gun?


&amp;gt; I do however realize the functionality of a utopian government over a utopian anarchy.


As I said, you have not been reasoned into believing the state, so it is hard to reason you out of the state. 

And reasoning into anarchy is way out of your league for now. 


&amp;gt; I don't really understand "I am not waving any guns or aggression against anybody, so maybe the statist could get out." that comes across as selfishness. What I said reflects quite similarly upon the principles of Anarcho-Capitalism. 


Am I forcing you to give up 6 months of year as a slave labour/government employment with a 50% tax?

Do I charge you directly for promoting anarchy?


All you are doing is pissing on the pool and saying that there still is plenty of clean water. And calling me selfish for telling you stop pissing in the pool! Very disturbing. 


&amp;gt;  Those who are members are voluntary members. Those who do not concur are not forced to stay members.


That is not a government. And you full well know it. 


&amp;gt; You are associating government with inevitable force and what Im saying is that this is not always true and does not have to be true.


Can I start my own government competition? My own money, passport, laws, police, schools, army ect as a competitor?
Can I not participate at all, monetarily and physically?   &amp;gt;"And let me guess, the education was statist worshipping because the curriculum must be state approved, and staying at home was not an option with the parents."

Not at all actually. I was offered the option to be home schooled but turned out down I don't want to shut myself off from other viewpoints. My schools curriculum encouraged us to be critical of everything especially governments. As I was being educated at a private institution within China our government approved materials were limited as there was information that the existing government did not want us to learn (pages of books glued together etc) But teachers always took it upon themselves to give us open access to materials and would slip us information packets "under the table" on the things that the government had removed from our curriculum. 

&amp;gt;"He sounds like he came from an ex totalitarian state" 

Not at all, he grew up traveling the world as I did. He was born in New York, had a bit of his Childhood in London and Singapore, went to college in California, got his first Job in New Zealand then moved to China.


&amp;gt;"Are you saying that if you are in an area that 51% want to practice the state, the 49% should leave, or that the 49% can opt out of the services you supply?"

Im saying that 100% can opt out of the services that I wish to supply (well lets make that 99% because at least 1% of the people will actually be supplying the services). But why would they want to when I give them everything they could need or want and provide absolute freedom? 

&amp;gt;"So in your view the government should be improving every day just as the private sector, and you refuse to see the evidence of what is going on in public sector and the private one."

I dont quite understand what you are saying here but ill structure a response based off of my understanding. Im making the reasonable assumption that no body is perfect. Governments are run by people thus its difficult for a government to have zero flaws. Sometimes a government could realize its own flaws and solve them. If these flaws are major and not realized however, the citizens have the ability to make the government realize these flaws and the appropriate changes will be made openly as long as they are legitimized by the peoples significant majority support or through reason. 

&amp;gt;"You had a rather good life of being a tax cattle in others tax farm. For the majority of the world living like a tourist is rather hard and expansive." 

Well yes, your right, I had a fantastic life as a "tax cattle" and I'm not ashamed that I was given a better life than others. Is it wrong for me to want to give others the same opportunities? or to at least feel that others deserve them? FYI, as much as you may hate them, taxes are necessary. We operate on a system in which money represents resources. Doing anything requires resources, thus, doing anything requires money. Governments cant just create their own money because this is not legitimate. It would allow for too much corruption. People pay taxes as a way of legitimizing the governments initiatives. There does however exist a lack of free will towards paying taxes. This I feel is a difficult problem which needs to be solved because no one wants to have to pay for anything, but if they want services and help then they need too. There needs to be a system in which services are rewarded as the direct result of your paying taxes. You should have the right to not pay taxes but that also means that you have to deal with not receiving services. 

&amp;gt;"Leave as in you leave a phone contract, or leave as in physically under the barrel of the gun?"

Stop being so pessimistic and sarcastic. You know full well what I mean by leave. However, should you still not understand, Leave implies the individual ceasing their connection to the state on their own free will, an act in which the state has no part or role and must welcome them should then chose to return but can not threaten them with force to prevent them from leaving. Leaving can be geographically or just eco-political. The ceasing of paying taxes, legitimizing the states initiatives, participating in state activities. They could exist within the same geographical zone and conduct business but they would be excluded from the services which the state provides including protection.

&amp;gt;"And reasoning into anarchy is way out of your league for now."

How can you make such assumptions as if you have a modicum of knowledge towards my intelligence or what I am capable of. Your attitude is counter productive. I have reasoned myself into supporting the state. I am open to other views and have been which Is why I am having this conversation. The only person here who is being close minded is you. You refuse to recognize proposed logic out of your sheer mistrust of anything related to government where as I have acknowledged points in which you have proven yourself correct, have reached compromise, already altered my viewpoints, and given detailed explanations and reasonings behind my opinions.

&amp;gt;"All you are doing is pissing on the pool and saying that there still is plenty of clean water. And calling me selfish for telling you stop pissing in the pool! Very disturbing." 

That made very little sense. You should find a different analogy. 

&amp;gt;"Am I forcing you to give up 6 months of year as a slave labour/government employment with a 50% tax?
Do I charge you directly for promoting anarchy?"

Ok, where on planet earth besides your own head, except government regimes who obviously do not stand as models for the success of government, does this actually happen? I've never been forced to do anything by any government in a country in which I have lived besides follow the law and pay taxes. Being forced to pax taxes has issues and its a problem that governments need to fix. Obviously there are regimes where people are given zero freedom, where slavery exists, etc in other word how you seem to be envisioning all government but this is hardly what I'm talking about. 

&amp;gt;"That is not a government. And you full well know it." Besides you, who the hell has laid down the law that it cant be? There is virtually no reason why this cant exist and be called government, and there are examples to show that it does exist. One example is in many places people are allowed to quit their job. And there are governments which stand as models of what government should be which allow their people to emigrate freely and easily (New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland). 

&amp;gt;"Can I start my own government competition? My own money, passport, laws, police, schools, army ect as a competitor? Can I not participate at all, monetarily and physically?"

Absolutely you can! and good luck with that in finding the space, support, and monetary means to do so. The existing state may even help you try.


  &amp;gt;What separates Anarcho-Cappitalism from Anarchism? Is a state of anarchy not the absence of a governing system?

The belief in absolute private property is the usual difference.  This is kind of an oddly phrased question as AnCaps are Anarchists.

&amp;gt;If this is the case then how can social order and safety be maintained? Individuals are incapable of their own protection as strength is certainly in numbers.

I am not sure I agree that there is such a thing as social order, could you be more specific?  Safety is obtainable through private means and does not require a government even now.  Many people use some form of private security and almost everyone has some form of insurance against damage to their assets.  Some individuals can protect themselves as much as they feel they need to, and others can buy or rent protection.  The usual AnCap answer to this is to point out that this is well handled by an insurance like company (a Dispute Resolution Organization, DRO).

&amp;gt;Anarcho-Capitalism defines that a state would be protected by privately funded organizations but how is this any different from government in any way?

AnCapism does not necessarily have states.  In fact it necessarily does not have states as we currently think of them.  Groups can voluntarily form something like a state (if they do not infringe on non-group members) but it would be a totally voluntary association and might have no concept of territory.

&amp;gt;If organizations are run by humans, and humans can have malicious intents how can all out war between these organizations be prevented? 

War is expensive and in an AnCap society there is no limited liability pool to make war seem less expensive than it is.  Anyone whose rights are violated, property is damaged, etc. will take you into arbitration for restitution.  If you want to do business with anyone ever again you will settle the dispute peacefully.

&amp;gt;Isn't it natural for people to want to follow the private organization which functions the best, thus causing the failure of other private organizations and resulting in a singular social protector?

No single company can offer the product everyone wants, there will always be competition unless there are external forces (like states) which put up artificial barriers to enter the market and thus distort the market.  If a company could, in theory, offer everyone exactly what they wanted at the price they were willing to pay then there is no problem.

&amp;gt;Is this not how government is created?

No.  Governments are formed by fiat through force (or the threat of force).

&amp;gt;What is a realistic model for a lasting Anarcho-Capitalist state?

That sentence does not make sense, there is no State in an anarchist society.

&amp;gt;I hope that you can present points that will at least help me understand the Anarcho-Capitalist philosophy.

You should probably start with [r/AnCap101](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnCap101) or the other things in the side bar. Im not entirely sure I understand your reasoning for how war could be avoided. Of corse there are ways that war or violent could be resolved but how does one actually completely prevent it in the first place? Btw by "state" i don't mean as territory I mean as a state of being as in "to be in a state of enlightenment" opposed to "in the state of Virginia." So by Anarchist state I mean being in the state of anarchism not a territory. Man I hate multiple meanings we seriously need new speak. I leave my statement at this so that you have the opportunity to focus more on this point. If you want to know other instances in which I digress please ask. &amp;gt;Of corse there are ways that war or violent could be resolved but how does one actually completely prevent it in the first place?

Who would go to war, and against whom?  Have you ever seen McDonalds go to war against Taco Bell?  With totally voluntary association and no public property if you need to move a tank from A to B how would you do it without incurring the wrath of all of your neighbors and whoever owns the roads?  Will that be cheap to resolve?  No one is saying there will not be violence.  AnCapism is not utopian.  This idea of war as it has existed throughout all of history though is rooted in the idea of territory which does not make much sense in an AnCap society.

&amp;gt;Anarchist state:

There are a few schools of anarchist thought.  I am a voluntarist and a propertarian.  Essentially all that is required is that people adopt something like the NAP (non-aggression principle or a zero aggression principle) as a framework for individual rights or as a guiding meta-ethic.  How that comes about differs depending on who you ask.  I am a big fan of Agorism (see the sidebar).  Who would go to war, and against whom? 

The goal of cooperation's is not good will. Taco bell does not make tacos to please the world, they do so because it offers them material gain. When other cooperation's threaten that gain it can easily be seen as reason to go to war. People will always have viewpoints and opinions. Humans are emotional animals and thus not everyone is capable of keeping a level head during a conflict of opinions. Some absolutely adhere to the conception that "I am right and he is wrong." Force is always an option. It may not be an option that we would like individuals to take, but its always possible. Thus, I see every reason as to why war could erupt. How does one suppress a peoples will to do harm to each other without using force and without removing their freedom to commit harm? Im sorry, but we cant only resort to punishing people for their actions. There has to be some measure for prevention of ill action. War is actually an incredibly expensive thing- the only reason it's been so common is that taxation systems have removed all sense of fiscal prudence from states. Why not spend millions on armies and military tech when you've got a whole nation getting fleeced for billions every year? Not to mention the legal* and social fallout of violence...I don't think many people would enjoy Taco Bell if they had a habit of assassinating competing fast food execs.

&amp;gt;How does one suppress a peoples will to do harm to each other without using force and without removing their freedom to commit harm?

You cannot. Even under a statist system like ours, we can't forcibly prevent violence. We can ban guns, but you can still kill someone with a fist or a pen. The theoretical potential for violence is something that even the most totalitarian society can't truly control.

&amp;gt;Im sorry, but we cant only resort to punishing people for their actions. There has to be some measure for prevention of ill action.

How else would you do it? Our current legal system is based entirely on punishing people for their actions, and beyond having a just and non-deprived culture/society, I can't think of any other way to sensibly prevent crime.

*Yes, one can have "legal" systems in an Anarchistic society, based mostly on security and insurance firms. Look up "Polycentric Law" for more, because I suck at explaining this.   I don't recall who made the case for it, someone at Mises probably, but there was the concept of voluntary imprisonment as a means of protection and employment for "outlaws" I believe you're thinking of Robert Murphy on the [market for security](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYJYSm-MfI). Who would go to war, and against whom?

Is all depends on your definition of Anarchism and Anarcho-Capitalism. Since people tend to have a vast array of definition of those terms, I will refrain from guessing what yours are.

&amp;gt; Is a state of anarchy not the absence of a governing system?

Again, this would depend on your definition of anarchy. I tend to define anarchy as the absence of a ruler who would impose his will using force. If you agree with that definition, you can have a voluntary governing system and still have anarchy.

&amp;gt; If this is the case then how can social order and safety be maintained?

That's kind of a broad question. I would rephrase it as *how can people defend themselves against the initiation of force* if there is no central authority who has the monopoly on the initiation of force.

We really don't know how (the specific details) people would deal with the initiation once they are free to use the solutions they want (without the use of force from the government). It would free people's mind from the idea that they should rely on an external entity and people would most likely come up with creative ideas we cannot dream of. It would be a thinking outside the box thing which is hard to visualize when you are in the box or even when you know the box is not real.

Anyway, here is how I feel, the general and gradual response to the initiation of force would go.

* **People would directly defend against the initiation of force**. They could use self-defence. They could ask their family and friends to help them defend themselves. They could hire a defence agency to help them protect themselves. They could ask for charity to help them defend themselves. They could hide or run from any potential initiation of force. There are many ways they could directly defend against it.
* **People would seek a compensation for the initiation of force**. This would most likely happen if they were not able to directly defend themselves. They could ask and negotiate directly with the ones who initiated force for a compensation. They could use an arbitration company to negotiate a compensation. They could have taken an insurance policy prior to the initiation of force in case it would happen and ask the insurance company for a compensation. The initiation of force could have happened while the parties were involved in a contract which had a clause for a compensation in case one of the party used force. I'm sure there are other ways of being compensated that I forgot.
* **People would publicize the aggression**. This would most likely happen if they were not able to directly defend themselves and if they were not able to get compensated for the initiation of force. They would tell the media what happened, who did it and under which circumstances. They would include their cases in some kind of public database where other people would able to freely search from. They would create a facebook post about it. They would tweet about it. The people who initiated the force would have their reputation lowered. There would be some reputation databases were people would be able to search from similar to our current credit reputation databases. At some point, people with a low enough reputation would not be able to trade with others because they would be scared, because they wouldn't want to associate with them and get their reputation tarnished too or because they do not approve what they did. People with low reputation would have to live like outcasts. They would be ostracized. They would not be able to buy food at groceries or rent an apartment anywhere. The social rejection would be their prison.

&amp;gt; Individuals are incapable of their own protection as strength is certainly in numbers.

Do you have any fact or evidence that support this opinion?

&amp;gt; Anarcho-Capitalism defines that a state would be protected by privately funded organizations but how is this any different from government in any way?

I do not think that's how AnCaps defines what a state would be. The difference between privately funded organizations and what the government is doing is simple. The government is force. Doing business or not with a private company is voluntary.

&amp;gt; If organizations are run by humans, and humans can have malicious intents how can all out war between these organizations be prevented?

They cannot really be fully and 100% of the time prevented. It would be a lie to say otherwise. However, the big difference is that private companies have limited financing. War is a lost for everyone. It is not economically profitable to wage wars. Bankruptcies would be the reality for many of those engaging in those *wars*. Thank you. You have created a reasoned argument. I do not fully agree with it on all areas however in the majority it actually concurs with my current views. It would seem that your definition of Anarchy is the same as my Definition of Utopian Governance. 

To answer your question "Do you have any fact or evidence that support this opinion?" Yes there is fact or evidence which supports this. If its me in a fight against 20 other guys (despite how awesome I am lol) I will lose that fight. In order to protect oneself from those with malicious intent one almost always has to resort to seeking protection through a organization, collective body, or social group. Currently these are in the forms of the police, the justice system, the military, community groups and social groups (these include more radical ones like the taliban). When others join in order to commit harm comparatively as an individual I am insignificant. The power to prevent their will to do harm is found, as you described, through means such as telling the media. That is the strength through numbers which I had described. I am against things like brainwashing but heres a dilemma and question I face. The anarchist state allows for people to join together to do good and they have freedom of thought on that, but doesn't that also allow for people who share, well lets call it evil, views to also band together? Whose to say they will even care if they are ostracized by a community wont that cause them to further hate that community and do increase their will to do harm? whats to prevent them from brainwashing their own children into their cause. In a world of 7 billion people individuals are likely to share view points with some one else. Thats statistics. This means that "bad" viewpoints are likely to be shared and you get groups of barbarians, extremists, just over all bad people. When these groups form who's to say that they will care ate all about what the "free" men think about them? we can go to war with them either way. Sadly, it seems like there might be some importance to a degree of "this is right and this is wrong" in education.  When deciding who your friends are, would you say that you are under a system with the absence of a ruler who would impose his will using force? Are friendships an utopian governance?

Assuring one's defense is not only about numbers. Just like wars are not only about numbers. You've got mobility, visibility, strategy, technology, logistics and a few other aspects which have a huge influence on the outcome.

Joining together and trading peacefully is a mutually beneficial relationship. Both parties end up better by working together. On the end other, waging war and fighting each other is a lost for everyone. I think we place our bets on people willing to end up in a better situation than they were before and on being able to teach them that. Maybe some day man will finally realize the benefits of peace. But until then how do we deal with those who only realize war as the solution? Maybe some day man will finally realize the benefits of peace.

When these groups form who's to say that they will care ate all about what the "free" men think about them? we can go to war with them either way. Sadly, it seems like there might be some importance to a degree of "this is right and this is wrong" in education.   In anarcho-capitalism, capitalists and global corporations provide the centers of order and law, however they do so without territoriality, something that traditional anarchists are utterly opposed to. But as corporations provide the centers of order and law does that not make them government? If they have the ability to provide order then have they not already establish a territory of control? Cant one argue that corporations are just as corrupt if not as corrupt as government, or perhaps the actual corrupting agent of government itself? How does one manage the managers? Isn't a higher power always needed? It would require quite a great deal of moral character in every one involved in this state for one to not have to worry about needing a higher power to manage the cooperation's. I would call it a near unrealistic amount of moral character. Additionally how territoriality not exist? Ownership only exists as long as the item it is protected. When a body protects a people or land from those with malicious intent does that not make the people and land that protectors item and thus, is territoriality not created? I cant help but feel that when anarchists are opposed to territoriality it is futile. In a supposed anarchist state how can one both have freedom to do what he or she choses and yet, not have the freedom to claim ownership of something? How can territoriality ever be eliminated when people will always fight to protect what they feel belongs to them? * But as corporations provide the centers of order and law does that not make them government?

First of all, corporations in the sense of businesses with limited liability are arguably antithetical to libertarian notions of resposibility for ones own actions. Any individual or group of individuals who commit crimes will be held fully accountable for their own actions.

Second, it wouldnt necessarily be businesses that provided centers of order and law. It could just as well be atomic individuals fending for themselves, or non-profits, co-ops etc etc etc. It is likely however that a substantial amount of organizations that provide order and law will be profit-seeking businesses.

Third, it is not "government" in any meaningful sense of the word as long as no entity has a legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force and ultimate arbitratorship.

* If they have the ability to provide order then have they not already establish a territory of control? 

Order and law does not necessarily need exclusive "territory". Already in our society, different laws apply to people living in the same geographical jurisdiction.

* Cant one argue that corporations are just as corrupt if not as corrupt as government, or perhaps the actual corrupting agent of government itself?

Humans are corrupt. Government is a means for leveraged and legitimized corruption because it has a legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force and ultimate arbitratorship.

* How does one manage the managers?

There are none.

* Isn't a higher power always needed?

Why would it be? How would you manage the higher power?

* It would require quite a great deal of moral character in every one involved in this state for one to not have to worry about needing a higher power to manage the cooperation's

It is not a state. The government is the great enabler for corporatism, it exists to help banks and corporations, not to "manage" them.

* Additionally how territoriality not exist? Ownership only exists as long as the item it is protected. When a body protects a people or land from those with malicious intent does that not make the people and land that protectors item and thus, is territoriality not created?

Its not "territoriality", its "property". Property means "exclusive control of something". In the case of property in the form of land, it is to some degree similar to territoriality, but not completely.

* I cant help but feel that when anarchists are opposed to territoriality it is futile. In a supposed anarchist state how can one both have freedom to do what he or she choses and yet, not have the freedom to claim ownership of something?

I dont understand the question. Free societies do recognize property.

* How can territoriality ever be eliminated when people will always fight to protect what they feel belongs to them?

Again, there are differences between property and territoriality. You have an extremely hostile style of arguing.  But as corporations provide the centers of order and law does that not make them government? If they have the ability to provide order then have they not already establish a territory of control? Cant one argue that corporations are just as corrupt if not as corrupt as government, or perhaps the actual corrupting agent of government itself? How does one manage the managers?

How can territoriality ever be eliminated when people will always fight to protect what they feel belongs to them?  I quite disagree with the term "anarcho-capitalist". I prefer the term "non-aggressionist". The non-aggression principle is simply the notion that the initiation of force is inherently wrong. Taken to its logical conclusion, what this means is that there can be no state in any meaningful sense of the word (=anarchy). It does *not* necessarily mean that the world must or will be capitalist or run by businesses (though it is considered likely that this will be the case to a substantial degree).

* What separates Anarcho-Capitalism from Anarchism?

The non-aggression principle. Left-anarchists seem to generally think that the fact that they dont recognize or endorse property and hierarchies gives them the right to initiate force on peaceful people in order to eradicate property and hierachies. Anarcho-capitalists or non-aggressionists do not- we hold that property and hierarchies are OK as long as they dont owe their existence to the initiation of force.

* Is a state of anarchy not the absence of a governing system?

No, it is the absense of an entity with a legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force and ultimate arbitratorship.

* If this is the case then how can social order and safety be maintained?

Much the same way as it is now, but through voluntary means rather than legitimized monopoly on initiation of force and ultimate arbitratorship. There will still be police, courts etc etc just like now.

* Individuals are incapable of their own protection as strength is certainly in numbers

Correct. What makes you think all individuals will be left to protect themselves rather than organize means such as police, courts etc to protect themselves just like we do today?

* Anarcho-Capitalism defines that a state would be protected by privately funded organizations but how is this any different from government in any way?

None of the organizations would have a legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force or ultimate arbitratorship.

* If organizations are run by humans, and humans can have malicious intents how can all out war between these organizations be prevented?

Think about the premises, logistics and implications of war. Wars are inherently undesirable to most people, including the winners.

* Isn't it natural for people to want to follow the private organization which functions the best, thus causing the failure of other private organizations and resulting in a singular social protector?

Free markets rarely develop monopolies, and considering e.g. the seemingly infinite variations of laws people want to live under it is inconcievable (but not impossible) that such monopolies would develop and maintain themselves for significant periods of time. Even if there was a monopoly, it wouldnt be a real monopoly in any meaningful sense of the word as long as everyone is free to opt out and use alternative means of protection if they want to.

* Is this not how government is created?

Some governments may have formed like that, but generally it seems that societies that at some point were free were actually invaded and subjugated by external entities.

* What is a realistic model for a lasting Anarcho-Capitalist state?

One that looks quite a lot like the society we have today.

* As of yet anarchism seems to have less of a realistic goal and instead seems to be more of a "lets just get rid of the government that we have then we will figure it out from there." I can see anarchism only as a utopian ideology but not as an actual possible reality.

The same was said about the abolishment of slavery. "Who will pick the cotton? What will the blacks do if left to themselves? It is unnatural, cruel and immoral to set them free".

Fact is that there are historical examples of free societies with free markets that did very well. I just don't understand why there cant be a favorable compromise here where states still exist and as does government, but it is a fundamental principle of that government to allow its "citizens" freedom to chose to join, leave, support. There are people who voluntarily support government (even thought there are no existing ones which are perfect). But that doesn't mean that there cant be. I know many would disagree with this because of existing stigmas towards government, but there are governments which give their citizens such high levels of freedom that the definitions of those governments almost concur with everything the Anarcho-Capitalists thing should exist in a perfect world. Of corse none of them are perfect but they are getting there. Im sorry that I haven't been able to respond to all of your points. I will attempt to but its already quite late here hahaha.

(currently in China). Also could you define "legitimized?"

Am I wrong in deriving that what you want is simply more freedom and do not want to worry about the threat of force?

Lets create the example of a fantasy government. Lets jus call it New Zealand (one of the countries to which I have citizenship). Would you be ok with the existing government and being a citizen of it if you chose to be voluntarily and were not maintained a citizen through force? if you had absolute freedom of expression as long as it did not significantly harm others? If you were granted more freedoms and a more active role as a citizen in the decisions of that government? and if education was impartial and dedicated towards encouraging free thought rather than encouraging devotion? What is wrong with this state? As non-aggressionists, we hold that the initiation of force is inherently illegitimate. States, however, rely on arbitrarily de jure legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force. This may come into existence through democratic or other means, but can still never be *actually* legitimate.

* Am I wrong in deriving that what you want is simply more freedom and do not want to worry about the threat of force?

No, that is generally correct.

No.

* What is wrong with this state?

It still relies on the legitimized monopoly on initiation of force to maintain itself and its laws. It still relies on the legitimized monopoly on initiation of force to maintain itself and its laws.

How? The state I presented does not rely upon the initiation of force to maintain itself in any way. I stated that. "and were not maintained a citizen through force." Citizens willingly chose to stay because of the benefits the state offers. Also I still do not understand why everyone has a problem with a legitimized monopoly? Actual legitimacy can only be created through the people, and if it is the people legitimizing a state then whats the problem? they obviously want it. "monopoly" Its only a monopoly because no one proposed an alternative better state. When some one does then the state can shift to that. Why allow for flawed organizations to emerge? Dont say that the state is inherently flawed because im talking about Utopia here. Lets assume that for as much as we can understand, the state has found the best functioning system of governing its willful citizens without the use of force and only relies upon force when the citizens call upon the state for their own protection (say from a different state which wanted to go to war or something). And how in any way is an illegitimate monopoly better than a legitimized monopoly? If something is illegitimate that means that no one has approved of it. If people do not approve of something then how can it be ethical for it to exist? Even if its not a monopoly, how is an illegitimate anything preferable to something which has be legitimized? to something which the people approve of. Monopoly can be seen as bad, but sometimes monopoly happens through means of natural selection. The monopoly of a utopian society would not be created by the monopolies suppression of competition, but rather the peoples unwillingness to support anything inferior.  It still relies on the legitimized monopoly on initiation of force to maintain itself and its laws.

Fact is that there are historical examples of free societies with free markets that did very well. it would be a good idea to try to ask /r/anarchism as well, its not the fact that anarchists are okay with using violence as described here, its the fact that the philosophies stand on two different grounds completely. 

in brief, for anarchists, violence is a much broader concept, and encompasses a wide array of 'tools' some of which are 'systematic' like that of racism sexism homophobia etc.  We have yet to see a convincing, coherent and valid argument as to why racism, sexism and homophobia are inherently "violent" or "systematic". it would be a good idea to try to ask /r/anarchism as well, its not the fact that anarchists are okay with using violence as described here, its the fact that the philosophies stand on two different grounds completely.

Fact is that there are historical examples of free societies with free markets that did very well. Voluntarist already has the meaning of 'one who subscribes to the NAP.' Unfortunately the term "voluntarist" has been hijacked by the "you were abused as a child"-crowd. I have never paid them any attention, this is the first I am hearing of that. This is arguably OT so I feel disinclined to go into this in much detail here, but as for me (I can, of course, only speak for myself) I do not wish to be associated with that crowd in any way. If others can find it in themselves to simply ignore them, thats good I guess.

Also, I actually think that "non-aggressionist" does a much better job of actually describing what is meant. Not insignificant points. Thanks. FYI, I am not the one who downvoted your reply. I am at loss as to why anyone would.   To be fair not trusting the govenrment is pretty reasonable. Regardless of what it (Assuming USA) may or may not be doing in secret it is openly killing civilians in other countries. By any fair definition the US governemnt commits war crimes ever day.  The USA is by no means a model for an Ideal government. But there are others which represent the abilities of government far more successfully such as Norway, New Zealand, And Switzerland. These Governments are not perfect but are still improving. Perhaps one day they will reach a utopian state. I don't want to be an ass but I must point out that these are  the closest examples to utopia thus far in human history and I haven't seen any from anarchy. Every period of anarchy in history has followed the collapse of a government and the period is quickly destroyed by corrupting individuals who rise up, gather power, and set up their own "governments" (though I would hardly call these governments) like the period of warlordism in China following the collapse of the Qing dynasty.  &amp;gt; But there are others which represent the abilities of government far more successfully such as Norway, New Zealand, And Switzerland.

Maybe they will. Any state still inherently relies on a legitimized monopoly on the initiation of force and ultimate artbitratorship, which is why we would *still* not want to live in that perfect utopian statist society. What you dont seem to understand is that the main argument for us is a *moral* one. We dont care if a society is perfect and everyone in it is happy- if it is statist then *we still dont consent*.

&amp;gt; I don't want to be an ass but I must point out that these are the closest examples to utopia thus far in human history and I haven't seen any from anarchy.

I dont even know what to say to this.

Not even remotely true.

How is this in any way anarchic? You only seem to have a problem with force. Im saying that what if force wasn't ever used and wasn't even an option?  I must ask, because I had a debate with my dad and I couldn't answer this question. 

Who would make the rules and to what extent would the rules be reached too. For example, what's to stop me from having an entierly different set of rules for my property than all of my neighbors? 

If someone could address this please, I really need feedback with this.  You can have a different set of rules for your property than all of your neighbors, that's part of property rights. Maybe what you're talking about is what is or should be considered legal or lawful? I have a statist upbringing so this question might sound rather stupid, but what exactly are basic property rights? I still have yet to find a suitable answer to this question.

And yes, that sounds more like it. Who would make the laws? To me, that seems like it would involve a democratic process, right? Well a property right is basically the right to own some physical object, e.g. car, house land whatever. There are some differences and nuances in the specific rules as to how you come to acquire property but the basic principle I think is that you have an exclusive right to use or control this object.

You should start a thread on the law issue. Basically, the law has a different meaning in anarchy. It is not something anybody "makes" or "decides" in some capacity as a central authority. It's just of emergent from people's interactions. There's a lot of videos and stuff to introduce the concept so ask around. Maybe start [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/zbujt/anyone_got_the_full_set_of_intro_to_liberty/c63ad2x) I must ask, because I had a debate with my dad and I couldn't answer this question.

Well nothing, as long as you do not really have a major impact on them. Something that the can do is not talk to you anymore, you probebly will not want to live there anymore if you dont have anybody that wants to talk to you.

What do you mean? Radical life extension, consciousness uploading, quantum computing, and hundreds of other things. For example, it's possible that in about fifteen years, our ability as a species to control human aging will outpace the progression of aging itself.
I'm on my phone, but look up Ray Kurzweil, Aubrey de Grey (sp) and ALCOR. Well, I mean, I understood what you meant by "exponential growth of computing power".

The singularity is when technology exceeds the cognitive abilities of humanity. (After which it becomes futile to try to predict the course of existence.) Nobody is saying anything about infinite technological advancement. People have been talking about "The singularity" ever since computers became mainstream, but IMHO it's all wishful thinking because AI has made no truly major advances that I'm aware of since it became a topic of study 40 years ago.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)

AI has come a long way, actually.

I am also a monist and believe that consciousness is an emergent property of the neural interconnections in our brains and therefore should be able to be duplicated mechanically. Given the trajectory of increasing computational power and the interconnection of computer systems, I think it's at least possible that we could see an emergent computer consciousness in our lifetimes.  If you agree with Ray Kurzweil's trajectory, an emergent consciousness with human-like ability will be created around 2030. But information technology as a whole is growing exponentially, too, which includes genetics, nanotechnology and robotics.  Some could argue that Bitcoin is the economic singularity. I personally don't know, but singularity institute is accepting Bitcoins.
http://singularity.org/donate/  Yeah. Any argument with the statists and whatnot will be moot at a certain point. Once there is no scarcity of anything, none of this discussion matters.  The term "technological singularity" isn't well defined. There are at least two meanings to it, which are very different:

 1. As machine intelligence approaches human intelligence, the pace of technological progress increases faster and faster, with machines designing new, better and faster machines, until some kind of "technological singularity" is reached.
 2. What happens after the point when machines achieve human intelligence is difficult, or maybe even impossible to predict.

\#1 is a stronger statement and implies #2. I have a problem with both definitions. 

I believe #1 is cannot happen for various reasons. Hyper-intelligent computers will be merely a new set of tools which we use for research, just like computers improved on an abacus. Second, there are always real world resource constraints to what can be achieved. By the time we do get computers of super human intelligence all the "easy" discoveries will have been made. New discoveries will not be on fundamental principles but in applied sciences, such as inventing new types of materials or applications for those materials. There are subjective and economic factors to consider -- no matter how novel your product is, if people don't want it then there's no market for it. And new fundamental discoveries might require insane amount of resources -- like building a particle accelerator going all the way around the solar system. For those reasons and more, I don't think we'll have a runaway technological bubble.

\#2 is a statement of our ignorance and not a statement about the world. Just like when computer scientists were toying with chess AI in the 60s and 70s they could not imagine what computers will be capable of 40 or 50 years later, in the same way we cannot imagine what computers will be like in 2050. This "technological fog" will always be 30 or 40 or 50 years out. When we get computers with comparable computational power to that of the human brain, the same ignorance-based definition of technological singularity will persist as there will be yet other bottlenecks to overcome.   I was introduced to the idea by Dr. Michio Kaku's educational/entertainment videos. I'm actually surprised statism is even a very relevant topic to this. Kaku is an extreme statist, he advocates a one world government in order to focus on space exploration and colonisation. I know - but your comment alarms me a little. A lot of well known scientists are statists and a lot of them aren't. Doesn't mean I have to /hate/not bring them up/not refer to them/ unless you were just trying to add to the conversation.

Some of them are statists simply because it might endanger their career to be any different, also. I was just adding to the discussion, particularly because Kaku was mentioned and he's extreme by scientist standards.</snippet></document><document><title>Anarchism : Atheism :: Minarchism : Agnosticism</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18r96s/anarchism_atheism_minarchism_agnosticism/</url><snippet>I just needed to get this off my chest. Debating a friend who is an Atheist but a statist makes me so frustrated. He clings to the need for a state so badly, and I just keep thinking how much it's like a person clinging onto religion because they have not experienced anything else. The need to have a source of morality in God or the state is so similar it's mind boggling.   Yeah, the similarities are quite spectacular. The childhood indoctrination, the creation of (or illusion of) dependence on the hierarchy, the fear, ostracizing, and sometimes even violence against people who want to voluntarily leave the system. The closer the person converting comes to the truth, the more internal revulsion happens, think the exorcist. The cognitive dissonance is so hard to resolve, some people just refuse to do it.  Church, symbols, priests, services.

Parliament, symbols, public officials, fiat currency and regulations.   Lew Rockwell is a Catholic.  

I'm a Catholic Ancap.

I don't see what the issue is. The way you look at statists and pity their indoctrination is the same way atheists see a member of organised religion.   I wouldn't say that minarchists "don't know" whether government is a good idea.

Using humans as a commodity? I think I have heard of that concept before...   Or... what if we just had a market for currency? Here, give this a read: [What Has Government Done To Our Money](http://mises.org/books/whathasgovernmentdone.pdf) by Murray Rothbard There really should just be a novelty account that posts relevant Rothbard texts. You rang? There really should just be a novelty account that posts relevant Rothbard texts.  What would this be trying to accomplish? I could tell you all the economic ramifications of it if you like, but I don't feel like writing a Master's Thesis, so maybe I can talk about what you in particular you're interested in? Not writing a master's thesis, though that'd be pretty cool if I were that far along, just playing with the idea. I've been thinking about bitcoin vs a gold-backed currency. I like the idea of bitcoin or gold but think bitcoin will fall apart over time because the lack of backing and gold will not be practical as it is not transferable in a meaningful way. That has left me searching for a good currency that will hold its value over time, and I have yet to discover a currency that makes sense. I've played with the idea of creating a karma based currency but when I got to thinking about it, it just seemed like the number of people in the world would create the most stable economic system because it applies directly to what the global GDP can be.   To be honest, it sounds like it'd be the most unstable society imaginable. Now, rather than having to beg the state for cash for putting out babies, they get it inherently. And since the money isn't tied to the person, their parents will be inclined to use it with no regard to their potentially many children.

A baby boom would happen within a few years, and with it a surge of currency, causing mass inflation because demand doesn't change but the supply does. The low value of the currency would boost the need of parents to have children and a second boom would happen right after the first, causing further inflation. At least with The Fed the money supply is managed (and rather well considering we've not had terrible depressions and recessions), and with precious metal the supply is largely fixed. People-currency would slide out of control.

No thanks. I'll stick with silver. Yeah that makes sense, but doesn't silver modulate around silver production in the same way? It seems there's something interesting with bit-coin that the currency is locked in, but there's not any backing wich seems very fiat. I wonder if we could tie currency to the total number of atoms in the world? &amp;gt; doesn't silver modulate around silver production in the same way?

Yes, but the total amount of silver in the world (or if we get there, the universe) is constant. We could mine all of it out and we'd be trading a fixed amount of silver. I make sure to say the supply of silver is "relatively fixed" because silver production does happen because it is deemed profitable to spend money to bring it up out of the earth. At some point it would be unprofitable to do, and so we will never drill all the silver out of the earth because there'd be so much of it in circulation and use anyway.

&amp;gt; It seems there's something interesting with bit-coin that the currency is locked in, but there's not any backing wich seems very fiat. 

Fiat means *by law* or *by mandate*. Nobody is mandating we use bitcoin, but we are mandated to use USD in debt repayment (as legal tender), and so most people carry around USD because everyone is going to have to use it anyway. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem, so to call it a fiat currency isn't accurate.

What you might be getting at is how it's a *credit money*, which it is, much as the bitcoin lovers here hate to think about it. You can't use a bitcoin, you can only pass it along and hope that the value doesn't run out while it's in your hands, much like USD is currently.

Now, credit money is fine by me. I have personal lines of credit with my friends and family and because of reputations it works out great. I imagine on a large enough or anonymous enough scale it wouldn't be wise for people to just use credit cards to pay each other. The only real problem with credit money is that you don't want to be holding it when the supply of credit exceeds the demand for the credit and causes deflation of the credit, which I presume is the reason politicians and The Fed don't want deflation to happen. Credit money doesn't make for great investments, so you holding it may not actually be a problem depending on what you invest in, but it's up to everyone to decide what money they use and for what and why. &amp;gt; you can only pass it along and hope that the value doesn't run out while it's in your hands, much like USD is currently.

Happily though, unlike US notes, bitcoin has several qualities which make it very attractive to use as a medium of exchange (including: anonymity if you want it, no/low transaction fees, no possibility of your account being frozen, predictable low rate of inflation etc).

&amp;gt;What you might be getting at is how it's a credit money, which it is, much as the bitcoin lovers here hate to think about it.

Not according to Mises:

&amp;gt; A third category may be called credit money, this being that sort of money which constitutes a claim against any physical or legal person.

Bitcoin funds are not a claim against any person. [Credit money is created when financial instruments are used in indirect exchange. It is only a derived kind of money: **it receives its value from an expected future redemption.** For example, an IOU can be accepted by others, if they trust the reputation of the issuer of debt. This risk of default also limits its application.](http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Money#Credit_money)

-Mises Wiki &amp;gt; it receives its value from an expected future redemption. For example, an IOU can be accepted by others,

Bitcoins are not redeemed, they are only spent. Additionally they do not constitute a claim against a person. So according to Mises they are clearly not credit money. Spend and redeem are the same thing in an economic context, unless we're trying to get at bitcoin being a trading card game.

Fiat means by decree. Bitcoin is not fiat since its users are not compelled to hold it by threats maintained by the state.

what do yall think about [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1KsFDLZ3B4) in particular?   How are bitcoins protected from inflation? How are bitcoins protected from inflation? bitcoin block rewards halve every 4 years such that mathematically there can not be more than 21M bitcoins ever issued unless 51%+ of the network agrees to protocol rule changes that would alter that rule. On the surface it seems like the future. Tax/ inflation protected. I wonder how long before it's illegal.  How are bitcoins protected from inflation? How are bitcoins protected from inflation? It has built in inflation. Supposedly it's somehow better to have predictable inflation rather than none at all. Albeit, there is supposed to be an eventual cap and nobody will ever (wink, wink) circumvent this ceiling. Kinda sorta but not really. There is an initial distribution period whereby all ~21 million bitcoins will be distributed to the network. Essentially, every 10 minutes someone in the world gets an amount of bitcoins, and every 4 years, that reward halves - it is currently at 25 bitcoins. If you do the maths, I think it will be something like 200 years before all the bitcoins that will ever exist have been created.

The only way to circumvent this would be to get everyone to agree to change the rules at the same time. Bitcoin essentially just enforces the rules that the majority of people agree to - that's all. Whether or not that will happen is anyone's guess, but it doesn't seem particularly likely. It has built in inflation. Supposedly it's somehow better to have predictable inflation rather than none at all. Albeit, there is supposed to be an eventual cap and nobody will ever (wink, wink) circumvent this ceiling. The code is open source. If you've found a security breach which would allow more coins to be mined, there are many computer scientists who would be interested in that information. Otherwise, it sort of sounds like you don't know what you're talking about.  So the code could never be modified or patched to allow more bitcoins? The code has been modified twice to address demonstrable security threats by unanimous consent (the only way). While it is conceivably possible to issue more, it is functionally impossible because people will have competing interests. Some would benefit and others would lose. Thus any change in the code would be rejected. As the community grows, forking the chain becomes exponentially less likely.  kinda like when they reject raising the debt ceiling limit every year in the US? Nothing at all. Almost nobody who uses dollars had any input. I recommend reading some of the sidebar materials to understand these issues. These potential concerns have been discussed and resolved.  &amp;gt; These potential concerns have been discussed and resolved. 

Yet you admitted that it's possible to patch the existing code to allow for more. Your defense of this is that the opposing sides (e.g. democrats and republicans) will oppose any changes to these limits (e.g. debt ceiling). If I'm not understanding something that prevents any future code patching, then please explain. I thought that you clearly said it was possible though. *Sigh*.  I can't tell if you're trolling me or not.  Governments are "*representative*", meaning a few people make decisions for many.  Bitcoin is not.  I'm done here because obviously you have detailed questions and it's not my job to write you a dissertation on bitcoin.  If you're genuinely interested then - as I said - go read up on it.   </snippet></document><document><title>Fantastic Excerpt From Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18q7zy/fantastic_excerpt_from_harry_potter_and_the/</url><snippet>Chapter 60: The Stanford Prison Experiment Part 10

"Wake."

Harry's eyes flew open as he came awake with a choking gasp, a jerking start of his prone body. He couldn't remember any dreams, maybe his brain had been too exhausted to dream, it seemed like he'd only closed his eyes and then heard that word spoken a moment after.

"You must awaken," said the voice of Quirinus Quirrell. "I gave you as much time as I could, but it would be wise to reserve at least one use of your Time-Turner. Soon we must go backward four hours to Mary's Place, appearing in every way as though we have done nothing interesting this day. I wished to speak to you before then."

Harry slowly sat up in the midst of darkness. His body ached, and not only in the places where it had laid on the hard concrete. Images tumbled over each other in his memory, everything his unconscious brain had been too tired to discharge into a proper nightmare.

Twelve terrible voids floating down a metal corridor, tarnishing the metal around them, light dimmed and temperature falling as the emptiness tried to suck all life out of the world -

Chalk-white skin, stretched just above the bone that had remained after fat and muscle faded -

A metal door -

A woman's voice -

No, I didn't mean it, please don't die -

I can't remember my children's names any more -

Don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -

"What was that place?" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice had been. "What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was HELL!"

"Hell?" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. "You mean the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a similarity."

"How -" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge lodged in his throat. "How - how could they -" People had built that place, someone had made Azkaban, they'd made it on purpose, they'd done it deliberately, that woman, she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some judge had decided for that to happen to her, someone had needed to drag her into that cell and lock its door while she screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away without letting her out -

"HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?"

"Why shouldn't they?" said the Defense Professor. A pale blue light lit the warehouse, then, showing a high, cavernous concrete ceiling, and a dusty concrete floor; and Professor Quirrell sitting some distance away from Harry, leaning his back against a painted wall; the pale blue light turned the walls to glacier surfaces, the dust on the floor to speckled snow, and the man himself had become an ice sculpture, shrouded in darkness where his black robes lay over him. "What use are the prisoners of Azkaban to them?"

Harry's mouth opened in a croak. No words exited.

A faint smile twitched on the Defense Professor's lips. "You know, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have built it because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if instead he began to find their suffering distasteful, why, he would order Azkaban torn down the next day. As for those who did make Azkaban, and those who do not tear it down, while preaching lofty sermons and imagining themselves not to be villains... well, Mr. Potter, I think if I had my choice of taking tea with them, or taking tea with You-Know-Who, I should find my sensibilities less offended by the Dark Lord."

"I don't understand," Harry said, his voice was shaking, he'd read about the classic experiment on the psychology of prisons, the ordinary college students who had turned sadistic as soon as they were assigned the role of prison guards; only now he realized that the experiment hadn't examined the right question, the one most important question, they hadn't looked at the key people, not the prison guards but everyone else, "I really don't understand, Professor Quirrell, how can people just stand by and let this happen, why is the country of magical Britain doing this -" Harry's voice stopped.

The Defense Professor's eyes appeared to be the same color as always, in the pale blue light, for that light was the same color as Quirinus Quirrell's irises, those never-thawing chips of ice. "Welcome, Mr. Potter, to your first encounter with the realities of politics. What do the wretched creatures in Azkaban have to offer any faction? Who would benefit from aiding them? A politician who openly sided with them would associate themselves with criminals, with weakness, with distasteful things that people would rather not think about. Alternatively, the politician could demonstrate their might and cruelty by calling for longer sentences; to make a display of strength requires a victim to crush beneath you, after all. And the populace applauds, for it is their instinct to back the winner." A coldly amused laugh. "You see, Mr. Potter, no one ever quite believes that they will go to Azkaban, so they see no harm in it for themselves. As for what they inflict on others... I suppose you were once told that people care about that sort of thing? It is a lie, Mr. Potter, people don't care in the slightest, and if you had not led a vastly sheltered childhood you would have noticed that long ago. Console yourself with this: those now prisoner in Azkaban voted for the same Ministers of Magic who pledged to move their cells closer to the Dementors. I admit, Mr. Potter, that I see little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction."

Harry's recently cohered self was threatening to shatter into fragments again, the words falling like hammerstrikes on his consciousness, driving him back, step by step, over the precipice where lurked some vast abyss; and he was trying to find something to save himself, some clever retort that would refute the words, but it did not come.

The Defense Professor watched Harry, the gaze reflecting more curiosity than command. "It is very simple, Mr. Potter, to understand how Azkaban was built, and how it continues to be. Men care for what they, themselves, expect to suffer or gain; and so long as they do not expect it to redound upon themselves, their cruelty and carelessness is without limit. All the other wizards of this country are no different within than he who sought to rule over them, You-Know-Who; they only lack his power and his... frankness."

Hello fellow, Terp-AnCap!  I really shouldn't have missed it this year, but alas the pressures to go when you're not a student get outweighed by other things so easily. I got to ask a question on John Stossel. The guest was arguing that internships nowadays are unpaid and that this is exploitative. I said "we know from economics that markets tend to equilibrium - that is, they find the 'correct' price of a good for a given time and place. If an employee is paid below his 'true value', other businesses will come in and bid up his wage to capture the profits. If market works so well in the general markets for labor, why does it fail in the internship market? Could it be that there is non-monetary compensation such as being able to write on your resume you've worked for a prestigious organization?" Nice. Last year they had the warmongering criminal John Bolton. Did they have someone equally as reprehensible this year?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta7q1amDAN4  The Fed lends fake money to select banks so they either don't go bankrupt or make huge unearned profits. It's hardly fake money. It's real money, all right. They are scarce, they are fungible, they are divisible, they are identifiable. All credit is fake money. We only believe it's real because the treasury says it will make it real. But they can unsay it. I don't know what you're defining "real" and "fake" as. Every year, the government issues a blanket threat that you must give the government a certain amount of tokens or else be locked in a cage. The government accepts two forms of tokens: physical tokens (notes and coins), and electronic records at the Fed. If you try to create new tokens, the government will send armed men to kill you.

That's it. All credit is fake money. We only believe it's real because the treasury says it will make it real. But they can unsay it.

What I'd like to know is this:  When the velocity of money does start to increase, by what mechanism will the Fed get all the excess money out of the economy before massive inflation, and does that mechanism seem like it could be effective? The only "mechanism" I know of that the Fed could use is increasing interest rates.  But they really don't have much wiggle-room with that, because the Federal Government would have to make some major cuts before it could dedicate more capital to interest payments.

As such, I'd like to share this section of "Man, Economy, and State"</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18p9ne/i_think_its_good_to_have_a_clear_understanding_of/</url><snippet>"Before we examine the exchange process further, it must be
considered that, in order for a person to exchange anything, he
must first possess it, or own it. He gives up the ownership of good
X in order to obtain the ownership of good Y. Ownership by one
or more owners implies exclusive control and use of the goods
Direct Exchange owned, and the goods owned are known as  property. Freedom
from violence implies that no one may seize the property of another by means of violence or the threat of violence and that
each person&#8217;s property is safe, or &#8220;secure,&#8221; from such aggression.

What goods become property? Obviously, only scarce means
are property. General conditions of welfare, since they are
abundant to all, are not the objects of any action, and therefore
cannot be owned or become property. On the free market, it is
nonsense to say that someone &#8220;owns&#8221; the air. Only if a good is
scarce is it necessary for anyone to obtain it, or ownership of it,
for his use. The only way that a man could assume ownership of
the air is to use violence to enforce this claim. Such action could
not occur on the unhampered market.

On the free, unhampered market, a man can acquire property in scarce goods as follows: (1) In the first place, each man has
ownership over his own self, over his will and actions, and the manner in which he will exert his own labor. (2) He acquires scarce
nature-given factors either by appropriating hitherto unused
factors for his own use or by receiving them as a gift from someone else, who in the last analysis must have appropriated them
as hitherto unused factors.10
(3) He acquires capital goods or
consumers&#8217; goods either by mixing his own labor with naturegiven factors to produce them or by receiving them as a gift
from someone else. As in the previous case, gifts must eventually resolve themselves into some actor&#8217;s production of the
goods by the use of his own labor. Clearly, it will be naturegiven factors, capital goods, and durable consumers&#8217; goods that
are likely to be handed down through gifts, since nondurable
consumers&#8217; goods will probably be quickly consumed. (4) He
may exchange any type of factor (labor service, nature-given factor, capital good, consumers&#8217; good) for any type of factor. It is clear that gifts and exchanges as a source of property must eventually be resolved into:  self-ownership, appropriation of unused
nature-given factors, and production of capital and consumers&#8217; goods,
as the ultimate sources of acquiring property in a free economic
system. In order for the giving or exchanging of goods to take
place, they must first be obtained by individual actors in one of
these ways. The logical sequence of events is therefore: A man
owns himself; he appropriates unused nature-given factors for
his ownership; he uses these factors to produce capital goods
and consumers&#8217; goods which become his own; he uses up the
consumers&#8217; goods and/or gives them and the capital goods away
to others; he exchanges some of these goods for other goods
that had come to be owned in the same way by others.
These are the methods of acquiring goods that obtain on the
free market, and they include all but the method of violent or
other invasive expropriation of the property of others

In contrast to general conditions of welfare, which on the
free market cannot be subject to appropriation as property,
scarce goods in use in production must always be under someone&#8217;s control, and therefore must always be property. On the free
market, the goods will be owned by those who either produced
them, first put them to use, or received them in gifts. Similarly,
under a system of violence and hegemonic bonds, someone or
some people must superintend and direct the operations of
these goods. Whoever performs these functions in effect owns
these goods as property, regardless of the legal definition of
ownership. This applies to persons and their services as well as
to material goods. On the free market, each person is a complete owner of himself, whereas under a system of full hegemonic bonds, he is subject to the ownership of others, with the
exception of the one decision not to revolt against the authority
of the owner. Thus, violent or hegemonic regimes do not and
cannot abolish property, which derives from the fundamentals of
human action, but can only transfer it from one person or set of
people (the producers or natural self-owners) to another set" (Rothbard, 91-94).    &amp;gt;He acquires scarce nature-given factors either by appropriating hitherto unused factors for his own use ...

Yeah, duh. I think you guys all agree on that. The difficult question is what counts as use and what counts as disuse. Let say you live in a jungle village and your people subsist off fruit that grows from the trees. One day your neighbor gets up really early and goes around to all the trees and picks all the fruit, more than he can ever hope to eat himself before it spoils. You are now forced to buy fruit from him or starve. And he makes ridiculous demands for the fruit such as requiring women to have sex with him and requiring men to build him new houses. Is this a fair situation? He put in minimal effort to "use" the fruit, and now everyone is his slave. &amp;gt;He acquires scarce nature-given factors either by appropriating hitherto unused factors for his own use ...

Is this a fair situation? He put in minimal effort to "use" the fruit, and now everyone is his slave. Since the people "subsist" off the fruit from the trees, i.e., they have been picking fruit from the trees; they "acquire scarce nature-given factors ... by appropriating hitherto unused factors for [their] own use" (the fruit itself) and "acquire capital goods or consumers&#8217; goods ... by mixing [their] own labor with naturegiven factors to produce them" (the trees)m they are all owners.

That is, by their past appropriation the villagers are part-owners of the trees - an owner need not be a single individual - so taking all the fruit could be seen as an aggressive act against the rest of the owners. (There could also be hell to pay the next day when the rest of the villagers, who, presumably will not die from a loss of the fruit from one morning's labor, assert their rights. As basically an abuse of the "commons", such an act would likely predicate more specific ownership or an explicit agreement among the villagers as to future use of the trees.)

You are, of course, right in that this is a difficult question and I'm not claiming an easy answer to it, just some answers that seem reasonable, particularly in light of the OP. &amp;gt;He acquires scarce nature-given factors either by appropriating hitherto unused factors for his own use ...

Would you accept the neighbor's appropriation of the fruit if this wasn't the case? I'm not assuming anything. It's my hypothetical, so whatever I say is true. Yes, the whole village already "uses" these trees.

Obviously not. Fronting money is the worse action anybody can do. It does not innovate them to do the job. 
 Well, no. Suppose a job requires investment money to get off the ground. Various startup companies are one example. The company *needs* the money to do its job. Thus, this can sometimes be necessary. Of course, anyone could just take that money and run. That's where you hopefully hold prospects of future jobs, for one, as a motivator to for them to keep to the agreement. Not to mention, you would probably have a contract as well.

As a side point, this issue could also happen in an AnCap society. Perhaps stronger respect and enforcement of contracts would lead to less results like this. If you get paid in the first place before doing it, would you still do the work?

Can someone explain the current situation regarding PLC, Inc, Ltd etc

Also what the situation would be in a free market; how it would work and how it would differ from the current situation.

Thanks  Limited liability protects shareholders from liability for the company's contractual debts. In other words, a shareholder does not have joint and several liability with the company that he has shares in. Since limited liability protects shareholders from general liability, which arises from contract and is based in contract law (all parties involved have voluntarily agreed) as opposed to arising from tort (where one party has committed wrongdoing against another), limited liability can be created by contract and is hence completely compatible with libertarianism. I don't know who could say exactly what it would look like in a free market, but it would might look similar to the way it does now. 

It is important to remember that limited liability has nothing to do with torts (shareholding tortfeasors are still liable under limited liability), like many libertarians get in the mistake of assuming.  &amp;gt; It is important to remember that limited liability has nothing to do with torts (shareholding tortfeasors are still liable under limited liability), like many libertarians get in the mistake of assuming.

Shareholders are limited to paying only up to their stake in the company if the company (and only the company) is sued. However, if the individual shareholder is also sued, and is found to be personally responsible for wrongful actions made by the company, he is liable for any fines and jail time the courts decide. The reason this happens so rarely is, afaik, because proving personal responsibility of individual actors of a company in court is far more difficult and less rewarding than suing the whole company. 
[Here is a quote](http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/97-4/Kahan.PDF)

&amp;gt; Limited liability is the doctrine that, in general, &#8220;shareholders are immune
from personal liability for corporate debts and torts beyond the amount of their
agreed investments in the corporation&#8217;s stock.&#8221;

This indicates that it's never been clearly defined and I believe this is why you can't really give a practical example. I don't quite understand your statement. What has not been clearly defined? The basis of limited liability is pretty clear.

I can't give a practical example because there are no cases (afaik) where an innocent shareholder was held liable for a tort against a corporation beyond his initial holdings in that corporation. Once again, if someone is personally responsible for wrongdoing, then that person can be personally sued. Otherwise, there is very little basis, either legally or logically, for holding an otherwise innocent shareholder personally liable for actions he did not have a part of. &amp;gt; The basis of limited liability is pretty clear.

If thats the case, then it's clearly defined to give immunity to torts. Your initial claim was that shareholders were subject to tort damages.

I think the part that you're conflating is whether there is a tort against the company or an individual (that just happens to be a shareholder).  If your point was that being a shareholder in a random company doesn't give immunity to individuals I agree, but you made it sound like if a company was sued, that tort damages could flow to the shareholders (they can't). 

For example. If a company is sued for $800k for polluting the environment, yet the company goes bankrupt after $500k, what do you think happens to shareholders? Limited liability means that shareholders are shielded from paying those reaminging tort damages of $300k. &amp;gt; If thats the case, then it's clearly defined to give immunity to torts. Your initial claim was that shareholders were subject to tort damages.

Actually, the initial claim was not made by me, and stated: 

&amp;gt; It is important to remember that limited liability has nothing to do with torts (shareholding tortfeasors are still liable under limited liability), like many libertarians get in the mistake of assuming.

And, just in case you missed it, tortfeasor is a person who commits a tort.

As such, the original statement was that shareholders who commit a tort are personally liable, and not protected by limited liability, which I agree with. Shareholders who did not commit any tort at all are protected by limited liability.

&amp;gt; I think the part that you're conflating is whether there is a tort against the company or an individual (that just happens to be a shareholder). If your point was that being a shareholder in a random company doesn't give immunity to individuals I agree, but you made it sound like if a company was sued, that tort damages could flow to the shareholders (they can't).

Nope. I never stated that they can, nor do I think they should. I do not think that tort damages, in excess of investment, should flow to any party not guilty of any wrongdoing. Having innocent parties pay for wrongdoing they did not commit strikes me as logically wrong.

&amp;gt; For example. If a company is sued for $800k for polluting the environment, yet the company goes bankrupt after $500k, what do you think happens to shareholders? Limited liability means that shareholders are shielded from paying those remaining tort damages of $300k.

Yup. However, if any of those shareholders were responsible for the pollution, then they can (and should) have personal lawsuits brought against them. you're missing one case:

1. shareholders who commit a tort are personally liable, and not protected by limited liability
2. shareholders who did not commit any tort at all are protected by limited liability.
3. shareholders are liable for corporations that commit a tort.

You (and herbert_spencer) are obfuscating the whether damages that a corporation commit are the responsibility of the shareholder. I don't think anyone cares about discussing whether a person that commits a tort is immune simply because they are a stockholder in some company. Thats nonsense.

the entire problem we're discussing is how "privatized profits, socialized losses" stems from limited liability laws. Shareholders can instruct a corporation to pollute or damage anyone at extreme risk, yet be shielded from having to pay for that damage, because it was done through a corporation.

&amp;gt;  I do not think that tort damages, in excess of investment, should flow to any party not guilty of any wrongdoing. Having innocent parties pay for wrongdoing they did not commit strikes me as logically wrong.

If someone is an investor in a project, I don't see how you believe they shouldn't be responsible. If you stand to profit from a venture, then you should also be subject to it's losses.

For example, lets say that you and I decide to make a business together. You state you just want to be an investment partner, not involved in the daily operations, but you still maintain a guiding hand in the objectives of the business. I explain to you that our business is kidnapping rich people and holding them for ransom. Our business goes well for a number of years and you become rich off of all the profits. Ultimately though I get caught and I turn you over as my partner, sharing in all the profits and making strategic decisions in aspects of our business. So you think you're immune from any culpability, despite the fact that you have profited from the business?

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For example. If a company is sued for $800k for polluting the environment, yet the company goes bankrupt after $500k, what do you think happens to shareholders? Limited liability means that shareholders are shielded from paying those remaining tort damages of $300k.

&amp;gt; Yup. However, if any of those shareholders were responsible for the pollution, then they can (and should) have personal lawsuits brought against them.

This is a perfect example of "privatizing profits, socializing losses". You're expecting that society pays the remaining $300k in damages. Those damages don't go away magically, they are there still and society suffers.

 I'll chime in. Note, I am not the other people involved in the conversation. I will discuss these issues from a consequentialist perspective, not a natural rights perspective.

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I do not think that tort damages, in excess of investment, should flow to any party not guilty of any wrongdoing. Having innocent parties pay for wrongdoing they did not commit strikes me as logically wrong.

&amp;gt; If someone is an investor in a project, I don't see how you believe they shouldn't be responsible. If you stand to profit from a venture, then you should also be subject to it's losses.

**Analysis of today's legal system in America.** Let's say a middle class, home-owning couple has a neighbor who wants to start a software company. The software company is incorporated and the middle class couple takes a 10% stake for $10,000.

While a client visits the software company, the client slips and falls on the company's wet floor, giving the client brain damage, and putting the client in the hospital for a year. Under the current legal system, the company could be sued for all of its assets; and, any actor who acted negligently to cause harm  to the victim could be held personally liable.

Therefore, the couple would lose their $10,000 investment, and whoever negligently left the floor wet would be personally liable.

If we do not limit liability, investments will come to a halt because no one would want to risk their entire fortune because some idiot leaves the floor wet. If the couple knew they could be sued for their entire worth, they would have not invested.

**Analysis under anarcho-capitalism.** Under David Friedman's version of anarcho-capitalism, there will be a free market for laws. Certain areas will limit the liability of corporations; others will not. People who do not want to risk personal liability will only invest and do business in areas that have limited liability. On the other hand, people who have a taste for such a risk will conduct business in areas that do not limit liability; these businesses will likely take out insurance and pass the cost onto their customers. &amp;gt; It is important to remember that limited liability has nothing to do with torts (shareholding tortfeasors are still liable under limited liability), like many libertarians get in the mistake of assuming.

 &amp;gt;I disagree that shareholders are subject to tort laws

Well, [they are](http://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/sbg/run-a-business/assets/beware-of-tort-exceptions-to-limited-liability.aspx).

&amp;gt;My understanding is that shareholders are not liable for any type of claim beyond what their initial investment was.

This is true for contractually created debts; this excludes torts. Usually, it is not directly the actions of the shareholders that cause external damages but when it is however (usually the shareholder has a corporate title), the shareholder must pay.

&amp;gt;Can you give an example where a stockholder was forced to pay damages for something that a corporation did?

Sure, in the case of *Omaha Indem. Co. v. Royal Am. Managers, Inc.*, the president and CEO of a company was held personally liable for over $132 million for mismanagement. The case *Lobato v. Pay Less Drug Stores, Inc.* established rules for when a director or officer of a corporation may be held liable. &amp;gt; Well, they are.

thats again the "personal action", not just remain a general stockholder/investor. Please don't be disingenuous, we are discussing two facets to this. 1) where a shareholder takes direct personal action and 2) where a shareholder is merely an investor.

&amp;gt; in the case of Omaha Indem. Co. v. Royal Am. Managers, Inc., the president and CEO of a company was held personally liable for over $132 million for mismanagement.

he's an officer of the corporation that was held personally liable. I'd like to hear a case where someone bought $100 worth of common stock and then lost $1,000s of dollars when the corporation was sued.
