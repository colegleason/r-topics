I thought that was the strangest solicitation and never even considered buying meat from the back of a white van -- but others there said they buy all of their meat from another vendor named "Jesse".  They raved about restaurant quality, delicious marinades and the convenience of delivery.  Have I been missing something?  Do you buy meat from the back of a van?   Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality. Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality.  I've had a meat van guy come to my front door. He got pissy with me when I told him no. "Wat'sa matter, buddy, don't you eat meat?! I could see the van parked down the street. It had the name of the company and a picture of various meat products so I felt he was legit. OTH, we occasionally get guys cruising the alley in unmarked cars selling it out of their trunks. As much as I love a good cut of meat, I'm not about to stand over some strange guy's car trunk parked in the alley. But yet you trust some bigass store's styrofoam platter and Saran wrap presentation. At least from the trunk you can put the meat up to your nose and also smell the cooler they are using to carry it around in.  Got word that the meat van is rolling thru today -- I'm lined up to buy a box of steaks.  Woo hooo!! Let us know what cuts you buy and your critique of their product. Exactly - want to hear about it!  I want a meat van to come by my place...   Very common in the city. Usually they say its extra boxes leftover etc. I figure they just buy it cheap and hustle. I've seen small sedans packed with white boxes driving around.
    
 Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Yup, Ive never bought from them, especially since they do this in the summer heat... However I hear the meats good, prices are decent too. Ill probably roll the dice one of these days.   After reading this thread...I'm almost embarrassed to say that every once in awhile we buy meat from some traveling salesman.  They generally show up on Friday afternoon.  Knock on the door - tell us about all our neighbors buying this way.  Seem to have an official looking van.  Fail. If the van is refrigerated and the meat was good quality, I don't think it's a fail at all!  Aside from someone trying to sell me shrimp out of the trunk of a Buick on 95th and Ashland, I'm embarrassed to say I've just never been exposed to the traveling meat purveyor.  I gotta get out more! :) - it seems like good stuff - no complaints!  That and Costco...my meat buying experiences.  I'm going to send them your way next time....:) I'm going to hunt down this Jesse guy who works Milwaukee Avenue over here.  The ladies at the salon highly recommend him.  I probably wouldn't even open the door if one of these guys showed up unexpectedly at my door.  I'm a Costco freakoid.  The traveling meat van is a bit pricey (despite all the claims of restaurant quality).  I do better @ Costco - but laziness kick in at times and the convenience factor, Friday afternoon, tired and hungry, etc - cave.   I would like to meet Jessie - he might be better!

Interesting comment by Brendan Diamond about DNA too. Besides this subject, I'm also not impressed with DNAInfo's "surprisingly gullible and shortsighted reporting" on other matters either, such as when they gloss over the criminal ties of some when they become "victims" of their own gang activity. I'll take the various neighborhood coverage though. No one else is covering local news like they are. Use the pull down for the various neighborhood areas and you get timely news no place else is covering. I navigate that website just fine, thanks. And they don't cover anything of consequence in Albany/Old Irving/Portage/Jefferson/Norwood Parks any better than Nadig does.

It also appears that Carranza's attempt (with the help of Pa Ricketts' toy, DNAInfo) to get in front of the NEWS posted at the top with a what was essentially a press release has failed. dna and nadig are two different beasts. you only get nadig material once a week on your porch and very little of it has a URL. dna is updated daily and obviously covers the whole city. Living here in Portage it's easy to keep up with Albany, Irving, Belmont Cragin and Hermosa, places that ring us here. Obviously you're a booster of DNA and what passes for "reporting" there. That's your perogative. I consider them sub-par at what they do. Carry on....... Obviously you're a booster of DNA and what passes for "reporting" there. That's your perogative. I consider them sub-par at what they do. Carry on....... I dunno about booster, but I see it as a resource. Here's the AM routine:

heat skillet
open http://dnainfo.com, read front page
place egg in skillet, cook usually sunnyside up
drop bread in toaster
peel a banana slice onto plate
plate egg and toast
pour a little OJ or pmoegranate juice
peruse both nytimes and dna whilst masticating
get more coffee

then the day starts "all or parts of the venue have recently been closed by inspectors" LOL.

Interesting comment by Brendan Diamond about DNA too. Have a look see at the most recent comments on the blog page. A familar name is of the opinion that there should be no oversight of public safety at a privately owned business.

Anybody have any recommendations? Repair or replace?   Tough to say without pics but not often reparable.   Do you know of an honest wheel guy?  I've never had occasion to require the services of one, but I've found this.

http://www.chicagowheelrepair.com/

 That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E. That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E.  i assume the rim job included remounting and rebalance of the wheel and it was done in less then a couple hours, seems like a good deal, if you got a rim from the junkyard and had to remount the tire and rebalance it, it would probably be close to the same price and more time spent going the junkyard route. Rim job?  Is the wheel steel or aluminum? Steel is fixable most of the time. Aluminum Is very risky to fix, so much that not a lot of shops will fix them.  go here in the neighborhood:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago While they do not repair wheels or straighten bent rims, it is a worthwhile place for used OEM replacement wheels at a decent price or to have a flat fixed. I go elsewhere for everything else. once a rim is bent you'd really want to just replace it, not knock it back into shape then mount a tire on it. Depending on the extent of the damage, they are quite repairable in the hands of a skilled tech with the right equipment. and where would we find one of these guys around here to work on a stock steel rim or an alloy one?

Also how do you "bend a rim" and not do other suspension or steering damage? go here in the neighborhood:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago I always go to Majestic.  Be prepared that it doesn't have the spit shine of Firestone or Sears, but the prices and service are great. I always go to Majestic.

Here's the first peep we're hearing from Eddie Carranza in the local news. They've been laying low until now:

http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130221/logan-square/congress-theater-owner-wants-restore-it-its-1920s-glory  Wow Jazmine has a fancy new title -- projects manager.  Fitting because the Congress reminds one of the projects.  I like how Eddie compares his security team selling confiscated drugs to a speeding ticket. There was some interesting stuff in the /r/Chicago post about the drug selling at the Congress when it all blew up last month. There was someone in the post mentioning how security gave him and/or a friend a "pass" to sell drugs in the theater.

Eddie's got a serious uphill battle with the City at this point. This would be one of them.

http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/16orza/congress_theater_eddie_carranza_one_big_load_of/

Pay special attention to the hidden comments that "score below the threshold". Wow Jazmine has a fancy new title -- projects manager.  Fitting because the Congress reminds one of the projects.  I like how Eddie compares his security team selling confiscated drugs to a speeding ticket. Wow the article was altered to remove the speeding ticket comment and make it seem like he takes the violations more seriously. Since the author (as opposed to "reporter") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously. Don't make judgement yet. Victoria the writer said to me she didn't alter the original article. she's asking her editors. Doesn't matter whether it was the author OR the editors. It was altered. I've asked who and why and will post what I find out.  It was kind of a puff piece anyway. Boy was it ever. There was opportunity for a good follow up when the pr person said that at least the bathroom ceilings weren't caving in:  "what kind of structural work have you done on the theater?" Because that kind of news would be useful. Painting a few places or swapping out some drywall isn't what I would consider major work - it's cosmetic. But if the cosmetics were delayed all this time because they needed to go in and fix structural things, that would be something I could respect. But that's not what we got in this piece, and it's the second puff piece out of DNAinfo on this subject. I wonder if they require their writers to have journalism degrees. Since the author (as opposed to "reporter") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously.

I'm familiar with, and lived in, Irving Park before but further west on the other side of the expressway and my only ventures over this way are to restaurants and the park.

The WBEZ gang map says this is prime "Simon City Royals" territory and while I take that with a grain of salt (apparently I have spent the last 10 years living in various gang territories without issue) I have a friend who used to live on Kimball there and said it was bad: lots of crime, gunshots, and gang activity.  Walking around at night was a no-no.

The street the house is on seems nice: well taken care of homes and lawns, no trash, and quiet.  I get the impression that a lot of the people who live there are older with kids or seniors.

Anyone know what it's really like? The plan is to live in the house for a long time and I walk a lot.  Disclaimer: I don't live *exactly* there. I'm north of Montrose, but only one block and I walk down Hamlin to Elston fairly often. The crime really isn't that bad in this area in general. Before I moved to Albany Park, everyone was warning me about gangs. I have never once had to worry about anything here and I have (stupidly) stumbled home drunk at 3 a.m. a few times (which I don't recommend).

Almost all gang violence is gang-on-gang in this area. Very rarely do non-gang-members get shot. It is kind of quiet in the area, but I love it here. I am planning on moving to the other side of Kimball soon just to be closer to the 'L' but other than that, I have zero issues here.

EDIT: Also, you'd get to live in a place that's in the Albany Park neighborhood and the Irving Park community area. My first time in the area, I got kind of confused about which was which. Awesome, thank you.  I figured it's like most places: there's crime because it's a city and that's just how things are.  My friend's first hand account had me worried on top of the huge orange box of HEY THERE'S A GANG THERE from WBEZ.  Not so much concerned about a random drive by as feeling like I'm trapped in my home from living in a shitty environment, which is how I feel now over in Albany Park. No problem. Hope that helps.

So you currently live in AP and don't like the environment? Can I ask which side you live on? I'm between Lawrence and Foster, off Kedzie.  My main beef is that it's ridiculously trashy, as in, garbage everywhere on the streets.  My ten minute walk to the brown line is like walking through a landfill and I've watched people leave bottles or trash on the sidewalks.  People don't care about their homes, lawns, cars, businesses, nothing.  It just feels run down and like everyone gave up.  I moved over here thinking I could go for walks like I did in Irving, go to the park by the river, but I just feel depressed looking outside.  The area west to Kimball looks much nicer but between Fransisco and Kedzie it's kind of a shithole. Good to know. My block is hit and miss. I'm off of Central Park near Sunnyside and it's block by block here. I generally don't go north of Lawrence. I'm mostly on Kedzie or Lawrence, or walking to the Brown Line from here. But yeah, the trash can suck sometimes.  I think EB Chris lives over by dere, maybe he will weigh in. I meant Chris from EB.  He says it's much better than it was two years ago.

 I'm travelling this week, will write more when I return. Yes, I live in the heart of that area, and have as a single family home owner for 5 years now. Prior I lived as a renter in Logan for 13 years.

I like it for the most part. 2 years ago though, we had some bad problems, mainly confined to 4000 block of Bernard, and 4100 block of Monticello, all gang related.

SCR's are so weak now its a joke. Most active gang is SGD, and they are active, though have now taken more root north of Montrose.

Our area has been very quiet now for a year, honest.

We have a VERY strong neighborhood group in these boundaries that is purely anti crime, IPCNA, meets monthly.

Being able to walk to tony's for grcoceries, by gadren supplies at garden center, walk to blue line, home depot and target nearby are god sends.

The biggest ongoing trouble area is north side of Montrose ans Kimball and cullom corner.

That help. Please don't hesitate asking anything you can think of, just be patient on my response as I'm travelling. But I am very active in community and caps and can give you the low down.

This thread is an attempt to reconstitute that resource, for my benefit and hopefully others who find their way here. This is a big-time home improvement job that many are no doubt considering.

I'll go first.

I had Xpert Flood Control come out and scope out my sewer. It was mercifully clear of roots and remarkably intact all the way to the street, no cracks or shifts or anything. Hurray! I asked for a quote on a flood control system and they presented me with The Cadillac as I refer to it, a $7600 package with more valves and electric pumps than I could shake a stick at.

I'm looking for a cheaper, simpler option. Just a valve on my sewer line, with an access point in my yard so I can pop it open if it gets stuck. Called REI Plumbing (the only one I could remember from the old EB thread) twice and haven't yet received a return call.

Any suggestions for who to call? </snippet></document><document><title>Chicago Fringe Festival coming to Jeff Park</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18wzex/chicago_fringe_festival_coming_to_jeff_park/</url><snippet>Just in from TimeOut Chicago, Chicago Fringe Festival is moving from Pilsen to....Jefferson Park.

Buchannan = let the nation collapse into violent civil war without more than a momentary and softly protesting murmur much less any visible effort. one "n" and he was a lifelong bachelor one "n" and he was a lifelong bachelor was describing him as a "bachelor" another way of saying he kept a very tastefully decorated White House?

Least: 42-way tie.

BYOB at the internets cafe. giddy up.  we'll do it again. soon. It's fun to go somewhere, compute and talk with others, drink some beers, and hang out. Impromptu. I just ran down to the Savoy and brought a six pack back to the PC Here. We're here. I'm here now. Typing on a PC, which is kinda weird. I don't have a laptop.  It's pc or smartphone.  Smartphone is why there are typos. dork. Lucky for you unneighborly comments are permitted here. Let's call Becca at home after we email her our reddit comments and get her personal opinion. She's using those donated Nokia cellphones now. I'll bet she's sitting pretty for a little while. It was NBC she worked for. whatta ya think? 50K severance?</snippet></document><document><title>anyone know where pattymelt is?  </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18mbg5/anyone_know_where_pattymelt_is/</url><snippet>anyone know where pattymelt is?

Wingspan had to be a few feet.  Brown with white chest.   Flew up and was perched on top of a pine tree sunning himself.  Looked to be about twice the size of a crow.  Sorry no pics.   Watch your small doggies! Coyotes will watch them Two-for-one on my block. One yappy little guy across the alley and one a couple doors down. I can only hope...   We have quite a few large hawks in our area.  [Red Tails](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/id), [Cooper's Hawks](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Coopers_Hawk/id) being the most common for me.   Think this is my third sighting.  First time a few days after I moved in saw one chasing a pigeon over my backyard, second a couple blackbirds/crows chasing one way up and then today.  

Grendel you seem to know a thing or two about wildlife around these parts.  Years ago I read about the renovation of the old Dunning/Read conservation area. Anything progressing there?

Maybe he'll catch said bunny one of these days.

We moved here in 85. The graffiti here was Gaylords and Simon City Royals. Like the gangs here now I don't think the Gaylords had a sophisticated top down corporate style business model for making oodles cash here. It seemed to be more about territory and chest thumping. It appears that the main bunch was at Fullerton and Lawndale at that time.  They had little satellite sets in other parts of the North Side like Belden and Knox.

The Simon City Royals were the other white gang and were based at Paulina and Cornelia. Off topic, but I am reading a book on the Gaylords and apparently in 1984 they had a set at Montrose and Narragansett.   There were some wannabe Gaylords around that area back then but we never took them seriously. They would mostly hang out and try to cause trouble over at the Axle Roller Rink in Norridge. I was in HS then and we all thought they were a big joke. One guy pulled a little toothpick-like knife out on a friend of mine. The friend was a black belt and didn't take kindly to being threatened. Until then I honestly thought people getting disarmed by a guy in three seconds only happened in kung-fu movies.

You heard and saw bullets flying here on Cuyler and Milwaukee and didn't call 911 while it was happening?

You made this same post/info on EB, right? I did call 911, I was told by a police officer the next day however that no one had. 

I didn't post this on EveryBlock, signed up for an account there the day before they shut down. How would the cop know every call that comes in to 911?  Just because he wasn't told about it doesn't mean it didn't occur and that other cops in 16 weren't told about it. I did call 911, I was told by a police officer the next day however that no one had.

Which EB troll were you?  

@ harrylee773  - Details make a world of difference.  " *Almost* walked into crossfire" is lacking details.  Throw us a bone.  Did you hear shots, look out your window, see nothing and call it in as shots fired?  Were you walking down the street as it happened?  What exactly did you see?

As for the cop saying no one called it in - I doubt it.  Did you happen to notice the district and beat number on top of the cops car that was taking the hole in the windshield report?  If the number on top  of the car didn't start with 16 (1620, 23, 33 ect) it wasn't a beat cop and likely an evidence tech or ex desk jockey from area 3 north who has no clue as to whats going on in our district.   I don't know... there were three or four shots fired near Lavergne and Roscoe around 6:30 tonight. I heard them but wasn't quite sure if they were shots or fireworks so I didn't call. I went out a little later and the alley was full of cops. Turned the scanner on and all I heard is they are looking for two shooters wearing red caps. If you find any details post up. What ward is that over by there?</snippet></document><document><title>r/greatNWside internet traffic statistics - Feb 14 2013</title><url>https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16556159/traffic_feb142013.jpg</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Ready Access to How Our Tax Money is Spent - Track Campaign Contributions Too</title><url>http://www.ilreference.com/about_us</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Hunter Spotted on LeClaire at 7:23am Today</title><url>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16556159/hunter-leclaire.jpg</url><snippet>  send em towards Irving and have him ticket the taxis that constantly park on my block.  Can't a commercial vehicle park on Irving at night and during the day? I've heard a few different explanations of the law.   Arena's office said taxis are allowed on my block because it's considered commercial, CPD says it's considered residential due to the 2 flats and have ticketed in the past.  Normally I deal with it because it's one or two just overnight off and on.  

6 months ago I took issue with a suburban cab company was using my block to park 3 taxi's for weeks at a time.  I called the cab co, tried to reason with him and he blew me off - "go ahead, call the cops".  So I did.  Everyday. For a week.   They were ticketed a few days in a row, one got a tow notice for parking 7 days without moving.  About 6 tickets later the cab co got the picture and I haven't seen one of their cabs parked on our block for 6 months.  

 Nice that your street is always plowed and salted too. I hate cabs, glad they don't park over by me!

http://www.handstohelpministries.org/


We have the following volunteer opportunities available:

OFFICE HELP
Volunteers are needed to help in the office on Wednesdays from 10:45 a.m. to
1 p.m. The job consists of general receptionist work: Greeting clients,
serving coffee, filling out paperwork, occasionally lending an ear. HTH is
ideally looking for 4 people: One volunteer to be scheduled for 1 week per
month. 

ERRAND RUNNER
If you have a car, and bits of free time each week, this might be perfect
for you. Occasionally our Outreach Worker requests items for our clients
(CTA card, toiletries, etc.), so the runner's job would be to go out and get
these when needed. Runners will be reimbursed by HTH. You may need to
coordinate pickup of donated items as well. A valid drivers' license is
needed.

For those interested in Office Help or Errand Runner job, please contact Lee
Stein at 312-608-1465 or leesstein@gmail.com

TUESDAY NIGHT OUTREACH
Volunteers are needed to provide lunches in lunch bags and take them to one
of two designated areas. Groups of 4 Volunteers will pass out lunches to
those who are in need, and offer information about HTH. We are looking for a
core of 4 to 12 people for this program. Tuesday Night volunteers will
attend a short 1.5-hour training for this exciting job!

LUNCHES for TUES. NIGHT OUTREACH
Volunteer groups are needed to make about 10 to 20 simple lunches for our
outreach volunteers to pass along to clients on Tuesday nights.
This is a wonderful opportunity for churches, scouting troops, high school
students, or any other group of people who want to do something to directly
help their community!

For those interested in Lunch-making or Tuesday Night Outreach, please
contact Rev. Kara at 773-960-1889 or rector@stjohnschicago.com

Central Kitchen &amp;amp; Tap
4800 North Central Avenue

http://www.centralkitchenandtap.com/  Be there or be square. Be there or be square.   Central Kitchen pissed me off beyond belief today. Don't know if I'll be back for a while. Enjoy, folks. Hmm. Details please. Nothing dramatic. I was just hungry, and when I'm hungry, I'm easily annoyed.

I called ahead as I always do. When I showed up, my food was already waiting for me on the counter. There was a line of about four groups of people ahead of me so I got in it.

All the people were taking an eternity to order. They were deciding what they wanted to eat at the register, asking for recommendations, that sort of thing.

I went up to the gray-haired guy at the counter and asked if there's a separate line for carry-out. "You Chris?" he asked. "Yeah," I said. Then he responds, "No."

So I had to wait in line for over 10 minutes watching my food sit on the counter and get cold while people in front of me wondered if they should try the mac and cheese.

What's the point of calling ahead if you don't get priority when it comes to checking out? It's silly. How did you know your bag(s) were ready after he said "no", or did you figure that out after he handed it to you 10 minutes after you walked in the door?  didn't know this subreddit existed.. I live next to the place :P Welcome. If you had to take a stab of a guess how many pounds of Brown's fried chicken have you ingested since you've lived there?</snippet></document><document><title>Reddit v. WikiBlock v. NextDoor v. CircleSavvy</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18gldw/reddit_v_wikiblock_v_nextdoor_v_circlesavvy/</url><snippet>Would like to read your comments about the pros/cons of these forums.   CIRCLESAVVY post here: CIRCLESAVVY post here: seems posts are deleted after a certain amount of time seems posts are deleted after a certain amount of time They clarified that posts do not in fact delete. They're still there under your "my circle," even after they become inactive (ie, no posts for more than 30 days). Even so, if you respond to it, it'll bump back new. Chris, which one are you going with for now?  NEXTDOOR post here: After looking at NextDoor, I'm not going to be able to post there.  Can't give a private entity my name &amp;amp; address, then create content for them.  I would do it if I paid a subscription, so I would have a leg to stand on, but not for now.  This is why I don't use Facebook.  exactly for that reason I don't think ND will have many people joining from a large swath of city neighborhoods. I mean I can see a whole block in the city or over the alley fence neighbors joining to keep in touch wih each other.  WIKIBLOCK post here: Waiting to see WikiBlocks terms of use &amp;amp; privacy policy.  Looks very promising though. From what I know about WikiBlock (which is little) is the following:
1) it's based on very very old code base of EB.  Like over 3 years old.  Most of the basic features we'd come to expect in EB won't be present in WB.
2) the open source version is not wrapped up in a bow for an install.  It's patchy and kinda shoe stringed
3) it appears to be written against AWS for an infrastructure, and appears to be kinda tethered to it.  AWS is the most robust and stable, but the most expensive.
4) it appears to be only one person working on this at the moment, and the individual appears to be more of a business person than a hard core software engineer (from his linked in profile, if the whois that was registered is actually the person setting this up).  I would expect new features to be introduced at a snails pace.  I would expect terms of use and privacy policy to be far from this individual's mind.  I think just getting something up is his focus.  He's requested help from other devs, but as far as I know he hasn't gotten back to any (disclosure, I threw my hat in the ring to help as I have much experience with AWS infrastructure, and haven't heard anything back).

Just what I know to keep expectations realistic.  Don't read this as criticizing this individual.  I thoroughly respect what this person is trying to do, and I am thoroughly impressed with what this individual has accomplished so far.
 Is AWS the Amazon thingy?  Not a geek.  I hope they contact you.  If you're the Chris with the DeNiro avatar, I've enjoyed your valuable content/contributions on EB. I'm sorry, I forget acronyms mean nothing to most people out of context.  Yes, AWS is Amazon Web Services.  It's a competitor on the cloud based computing front.  It's by far the best, and richest offering, but the most expensive service.  I have not delved deep into the WB code base, but the way they appeared to be storing avatars and images in the EB version used a AWS only feature, that says to me there are probably several constraints to AWS in the code base.  Personally, I favor AWS, but it puts a potential financial burden on an individual doing this if that is the case.  If set up right (redundancy, backups, load balancing, dev/stage/prod environments for rolling out new features, code repository, etc), with moderate traffic, I estimate anywhere from $500 to 2k a month for AWS charges once it's in full swing.

I'm a Java/Spring guy, WB is a python/Django app.  I know very little about python, but do have interest.  Where I thought I might be able to help them is on the AWS side as I have experience with that while I come up to speed on Python.  Been looking for a community proj to be on, and this one just looks fun.

Yep, I was the Chris with the DeNiro avatar (and last two weeks of EB with D. Boon avatar).  I liked your posts too Glad, even though your nick was Glad2B, I always read it mentally as Gladys for some reason, which gave me the mental connection to someone I knew and like when I lived in Austin.  That was prob TMI.  Thanks for the comp. though! Wow, that's a lot of money for AWS.  I would pay $10/month for a good place.  Thanks for the explanation and deets.  If you end up going anywhere else, can you let me know?  Signed, Gladys Kravitz. Waiting to see WikiBlocks terms of use &amp;amp; privacy policy.  Looks very promising though. Looks like Wikiblock is addressing some of those concerns.

http://chicago.wikiblock.com/neighbor-messages/?by-categories=wikiblock WIKIBLOCK post here: WIKIBLOCK post here:  REDDIT post here: likely stay here.  multitudes of other stuff to pass the time.  Me too...don't see an alternative yet.  I like the news summary blog that Tim Broderick is putting together.   Missy, have you looked at the others?  If so, care to share why Reddit is your choice for now? I have...I am mostly in agreement with your assessment of sites.  I started the OIP NextDoor community but it hasn't gotten any traction.  Even so...it is a smaller community (and not NW side) and the OIP community already has two strong emailing groups and a two FB pages that are used a lot...so seems redundant.  Wikiblocks - not ready for prime time - like you said I admire the effort - but I'm not going to give them my email (I don't have patience to maintain multiple email addresses).  CircleSavvy didn't look that interesting to me last week, but just went there and looks like it is getting traction....maybe :).  I swear like a sailor in real life...so don't a problem with anything I have seen on Kenji's site or NWSide site.  That said, I have no tolerance for racist, sexist or anything else that demeans people of any shapes, sizes or color.  Back in EB days, I turned away from some of the homeless threads because I couldn't stand some of the comments and what seemed to be a complete disregard for humanity... likely stay here.  multitudes of other stuff to pass the time.  Multitudes.

ETA:  I'm just emphasizing the word multitudes, That Guy.  I won't post one word replies anymore to avoid clogging the thread.  That's prolly bad Reddiquette. Estimated time of arrival? likely stay here.  multitudes of other stuff to pass the time.  I will likely stay here as well.  I was at an open gov hack night last night and asked one of the original EB guys why there was not an outrage in the open community.  He seems to think there is and was kind enough to give me an addy for the eb guy that wrote the UIs for EB that we have grown to love. REDDIT post here: One good thing for me.....Taking advantage of another subreddit to bring news from the racing webzine. REDDIT post here: Reddit is hard to pick up, but still trying.  Not a fan of the crass, lewd and vulgar.  It's not that I can't take it (or dish it), just don't want to have to deal with peeps who want to interact this way on a reg basis.  Just stating my opinion.  There's Monty Python, then there's Workaholics.  I'm more Python.  every subreddit within reddit has it's own rules and reddiquette/netiquette. You are doing a disservice if you paint all of reddit as crass/lewd/vulgar, because it isn't. That is true.  To be honest, I will prolly most likely stay in Reddit.  I could do without the cussing (masking is fine), for example.  I don't want to tell people how to post, however, I think if you want a wider audience for GNWS, maybe something this fundamental could be implemented.  Or not.  at what age did you read A Catcher in the Rye? I read it every year and I started at 9.  My parents didn't know what I was reading.  Speaking of parents.  If I took them out to dinner and the next table over by us was having a convo complete with expletives, I would ask for another table.  My Dad could get salty, but the point is for me is that others behave with more consideration in public.  I would like GNWS to be a place I could ask my rents to go to follow up on stuff in the hood.  That's all. so if we wanted to make gnws g-rated how does it keep sanitized? eb had employees 365/24/7, people who got paid. there's no employees here. OK so you direct your parents to come to GNWS on reddit. what keeps them from finding the porn and other adult groups on reddit? two accidental clicks and they could have penis on the screen in front of them, easily. I'm up for talking about your idea though. Maybe you can start a new thread like, "How would you make GNWS better?"  I would post the cussing thing, or mask it (WTF or F*ck).  My rents may be able to handle that.  I would just tell them to go to GNWS and tell them not to stray too far from the cruise ship/resort and avoid venturing into town on a moped with half a tank of gas, they'll KWIM. You can bookmark just this subreddit for them.  That's what I do for convenience as I check it throughout the day. I read it every year and I started at 9.  My parents didn't know what I was reading.  Speaking of parents.

You know about Reddit karma, right? at what age did you read A Catcher in the Rye?  Maybe I've missed it but I haven't seen much swearing in this subreddit yet.

Better? I've never really understood why motherfucker was one of the 7.  It's still based on fuck, which is already in that list. I think the incest angle freaks people out.  It used to be that MF was the most offensive term of the bunch, but I think the c word has replaced it.  You can expect to be slapped if you use it.

Better?   It would be nice if the Aldermen would join in as they participated in EB and it was great to have that ready connection.  However, I don't think they would join or stay if they joined with profanity or other such talk to be read...I'm just sayin' Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? Hard to say. I'm sure Tim's heard his share of salty language considering he used to be an electrician. Probably unlikely he'd be phased by it. Don't know about Arena.

Reddit in general is an oddball place for politicians. On the one hand, you've got polies, even Obama and Biden, posting AMA (ask me anythings) and answering questions. It's seen as a great place to connect with the unwashed masses. On the other hand, I don't know of many polies participating on a local level because it's a bit too personal. For instance, I've never seen an alderman post on r/Chicago.

Knowing Kenji, he's probably extended the welcome mat to both of them already, but they may not feel comfortable with Reddit. May be best to have a happy medium in posting communications from them until the day they decide to join.
 Ha! "phased".....electrician pun! Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? Mods, I agree with this.  What do you think? To recap, posters on this subReddit will be allowed to use any of the swear words found in the inaugural post of Mr. Carlin for reasons beyond illustrative purposes which may include said words to be used against another poster.   There is now a Southeast Portage Park NextDoor.com section if you are between Addison-Belmont, Cicero-Laramie.
https://southeastportagepark.nextdoor.com
You do not need to use a credit card to verify your address. There is an option to have the site call your home phone to verify the address, or you can have verification mailed to you.
You can also just show your street name in your profile and you can fudge your name if you feel the need. How many Portage Park enclaves are there?  Do you still get updates for just plain Portage Park, what about surrounding like Jeff Park, etc.? You enter your address to see if you are in an established area, if not you can create one and be the King (you set the borders)  ;-)
There are still a few open sections within the actual portage park neighborhood.

Here is some info from nextdoor...

Thanks for your feedback on Nextdoor 2.0! We realize there is some confusion on the new Nearby Neighborhoods feature and thought it might be helpful to quickly answer the most frequently asked questions: 

Do I have to post my message to nearby neighborhoods? 
No. You always have the option to post just to your neighborhood or to include nearby neighborhoods. 

Can neighbors from nearby neighborhoods see messages I have posted only to my neighborhood? 
No. Posts just to your neighborhood are never displayed outside your neighborhood. 

Can neighbors from nearby neighborhoods see my profile? 
No. Information about you is never shared outside your neighborhood unless you explicitly choose to post/reply/thank a message shared with nearby neighborhoods. 

If you choose to post/reply/thank a message shared with nearby neighborhoods, then those neighbors will see a limited profile containing only your name, neighborhood, photo and activity stats. They will not see your street name, street address, or any of the other profile details you have shared with your neighborhood. 

Can I see posts ONLY from my neighborhood? 
Yes. Click your neighborhood name in the left column of the Home Page to only view posts from your neighborhood. We will be releasing an update to the website at the end of next week to make this selection persistent. 

Since posting to nearby neighborhoods reaches many more neighbors, it is important to be respectful and stay on-topic. Please avoid commercial or self-promotional messages. Here are some of the best examples of when to post to nearby neighborhoods: 

- Sharing information about suspicious activity occurring in several neighborhoods. 
- Finding a lost pet that may have wandered into an adjoining neighborhood. 
- Rallying neighbors from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues.

Cullerton, on Everyblock, was that Christopher Belsan 's Skokie court date for his next trial is Feb 14th.   I reached out to Alderman Tim and asked him about the trial. I think he and the rest of the Alderman, this week, are busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking contest, so I'm posting this reply I got:

Belsan is due in court on Thursday at 10 am in the same courtroom in Skokie (107 I think...Judge Haberkorn).

I spoke with the ASA about a week or so ago and as far as I know, he will be offered a three year sentence on a felony gun charge with the possibility of parole is he successfully completes a 120 IDOC Boot Camp ( not the Cook County Boot Camp). I also requested that the Court order him to stay away 100 yards from Portage Park while on parole. If he fails to successfully complete the boot camp or otherwise violates his parole in any way, he will be incarcerated for the full 3 year sentence. The felony charge will be with him forever.

None of this is Gospel until the Judge formally sentences him if accepts the deal (which I strongly believe he will...... if he has any sense at all).

This is a far better deal than the usual offer to plead to a lesser, non- felony charge with probation, and I know for a fact that the community's presence at each of the hearings was a major factor in arriving at this offer.  Alderman Cullerton devoted a portion of his opening statement to this issue last Wednesday at the Community meeting and shared this information at that time as well. Well, you could have posted it here! The professionals at DNAinfo failed to report it as well. I did post a lot of other information from it though. Before they did...   I think Heather is staying away from it until she can get facts. Lawyers aren't going to talk until after the kid works his dealio out. You two are on a first-name basis, huh? I think Heather is staying away from it until she can get facts. Lawyers aren't going to talk until after the kid works his dealio out. Well, you could have posted it here! Incidently, the Alderman also detailed possible sentencing soon after the last court date on Everyblock in the big "Court Date for Portage Park Shooter" thread......  OK, link to that for us.  Better late than never. I have noticed that a lot of neighborhood meetings are at 6 or 6:30 on weeknights, which is challenging for those who work later than 5 and/or commute downtown.

Nope,  and it's Thursday.</snippet></document><document><title>4:4 ish today- apt building at the corner of Dakin and Lamon - half a dozen+ cop cars.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18enea/44_ish_today_apt_building_at_the_corner_of_dakin/</url><snippet>Edit - that should be 4:40...

Got home and turned on the citywide RR scanner feed but it's impossible to catch everything going on on zone 1.  I really wish someone would step up and host zone 1 again...   Had the scanner on.

I'm guessing the individual is in their's early to mid 30's from career.

Didn't look to have any obvious relations to Adrian.

I forgot the name, I was able to retrieve the address from my search history, but won't post it to respect privacy.  Let's try to get the PP section going again on Wiki, folks.

I feel like we owe them at least a few beers, or (in Kenji's case, at least) a keg.   I can't say I found them to be very professional.  They would often ignore e-mails (from others as well as me) and refused to provide any name or contact information when I wanted to talk to whomever supervised them (first at MSNBC and then later at NBC).

They would often ignore e-mails (from others as well as me) and refused to provide any name or contact information when I wanted to talk to whomever supervised them (first at MSNBC and then later at NBC).  When you don't treat your customers with respect, you deserve what you get.   To be fair, there was a staff of 9 monitoring every post that went up across every EB site in the country. Of those 9, only a few of them were actually doing the community management thing. If things fell through the cracks, it was a by-product of the sheer volume of messages flying around EveryBlock at any given time. 

Secondly - if you never paid for Everyblock, you aren't their customer.  I can't say I found them to be very professional.  They would often ignore e-mails (from others as well as me) and refused to provide any name or contact information when I wanted to talk to whomever supervised them (first at MSNBC and then later at NBC).

You know perfectly well they have been community builders and gave creative thought and time well in excess of the paid time.  They have earned the thanks of every single person who has even just scanned the EB salad bar.  Those who have posted and/or commented owe more.  Will watch here for trending rate.  Also my understanding is that there was no monitoring unless someone flagged it. Not true.

A 24-year-old woman was attacked at about 11:35 a.m. Thursday while walking down the 5100 block of West Grace. An unidentified man approached the woman, removed her clothing and attempted to sexually assault her.

The attacker is described as a Hispanic man with brown hair and brown eyes, about 40 years old, roughly 5-foot-6 and 130 pounds. Police believe he was driving a black Chevrolet Tahoe or Trailblazer with white &#8220;sport&#8221; lights.

CAPS Community Meeting Recap
I want to thank the 200 residents who attended the CAPS Community Meeting Wednesday to discuss the shootings last week around Portage Park. Although these shootings were outside the ward, I know criminals do not honor ward boundaries, and these incidents were a concern to all of us.&#160;

I also want to thank 16th District Cmd. James O'Donnell and 38th Ward Ald. Tim Cullerton for putting this meeting together so quickly. You can find a recap of the meeting here.

According to police statistics, crime is down nine percent in the heart of Portage Park this year, compared to last year. Arrests are up 130 percent, and police contacts with people are up 49 percent.&#160;

In response to the shootings, four or five more squad cars have been&#160;assigned&#160;to the 16th District, according to police. But police can't do it alone. Most of all, police need us to remain vigilant. If you see something suspicious, call 911.

We live in the 4300 block of N. Kildare. She (Token, a black Blue Heeler, Australian) did not bark.  I drove around the neighborhood looking for her, but to no avail. We hope she was not stolen.
 
She is all black with white around her nose and down her chest with dappling. She is a good runner and a sweet dog. We miss her terribly. She has tags and a microchip in her shoulder. She is 3 years old, with a crooked little mouth (we think she was abused when she was younger). Was adopted from a shelter two years ago at a Wolves Game by our son and grandson. Thank you!

Without EB, their paper is the most "hyperlocal" news source once again in Jefferson and Portage Parks.

Everyone should duke the local kids who deliver it an extra ten spot next time they come to collect.  There are really only two pages of news in it -- the front page and then continued on the page where the police blotter is.  The rest is press releases for bingo and fundraiser spaghetti dinners.   We have to pick it too...no delivery in my hood. What intersections are you two near? South side of Irving - behind YMCA.  When we lived @ Lowell &amp;amp; Montrose we got it delivered...but when we moved south of Irving - I called - no delivery.  We looked forward to it every week. Do you grab it from Java Thai? nope - the little corner store next to subway in the strip mall.  java thai - oddly enough never been...want to. Do they still have a jaz brunch at Java Thai on Sundays? What intersections are you two near? Austin/Berteau  It's hasn't showed up at my house in some time. Haven't seen a kid to collect in ages.

WTF?  Nadig is responsible hyper local.  And fact based.  Mostly.

Everyone surviving the post-EB hangover?  :) Everyone surviving the post-EB hangover?  :) Hey, what other interests do you have? I'll point you to other subreddits so you get a feel for Reddit. Hey, what other interests do you have? I'll point you to other subreddits so you get a feel for Reddit. Everyone surviving the post-EB hangover?  :) Hey there TLO,
As you can see, with all my posting here it appears as if I have a case of the delerium tremens.  It has helped, since I actually do feel like I'm decompressing.   Hi Glad.  I was weaning myself off of EB for the past month, so my withdrawl symptoms are relatively mild.    Like most, I used EB to keep in touch with events in the neighborhood.  I enjoyed helping restore the parklet, assisting the wheelchair man with supplies, and having a few meals with Patty's Diner's Club.  Had a few spirited debates with users but generally backed away from the keyboard when things got too heated.  We'll see if we can replace the EB community on reddit or another blog.  Yes --- I said it -- a blog.  Because I chuckled when the final EB post used that term to describe EB.  Take that, Kenji :) Hey there TLO,
As you can see, with all my posting here it appears as if I have a case of the delerium tremens.  It has helped, since I actually do feel like I'm decompressing.   I sent a response to this earlier - did it just get sent to Glad's in-box? Or are comments reviewed by a moderator before being posted?  I'm clueless about reddit.
  I had a love/hate relationship with EB. On one hand, I thought it was a great one-stop resource for keeping up-to-date with happenings in the neighborhood. OTH, I would tire of the endless stream Gladys Kravitz types and sky is falling old cranks talking in code about all the "changes" coming to the neighborhood. I always appreciated how Kenji (and others) would sort of needle those folks to keep them honest. Then, there was the "New" Democrats and all their trolls that would pop up like that Whack-A-Mole game any time there was an election in the 45th. The "What Used to be Here" thread was one of my all time favorites. I loved reading the stories by long time Jeff Parkers. It saddens me that that thread is gone for good. That thread, along with the Save The Portage efforts were perfect examples of how EB could bring folks together in good ways.  The great thing about EB was their ability to aggregate relevant area news stories, and especially city data such as area building permits, inspections and reported crimes. A "one stop shop" in other words where I could dig deeper or gloss over depending it's importance to me. The Community Calendar was also very useful.  Agree on those features.  I liked those as well.  Would you mind sharing who you were on EB?  If not that's okay.   Bill the Engineer. I agreed with virtually everything you posted.   Anyone else want to talk?  I'm being told what and how to post. Don't get all bent outta shape. You want us to get a feel for your moderation, yes?  None of us should hold back, no? Not sure what you mean? Most likely the only things that will need to be moderated are racist comments as we go along. You've read the sidebar, right? Yes, the sidebar is almost straight out of the /r/Chicago sidebar.  You mod this subReddit, so we're, me at least, getting a feel for you.  So when a mod tells me to stop b*tching and it has nothing to do with race, then we're getting an opportunity to see how your mind works.  Lay of your land, so to speak.  (I'm a product of primary, secondary and beyond Catholic Ed.) I think you are confusing moderator xrawv, and just plain xrawv. If you posted a racist comment, being there's zero tolerance, your post would just disappear and there might not be a comment made by moderator xrawv about it. If plain old xrawv is telling you to stop whining or bitching he's teling you what he thinks or feels, that's not moderation.

I'm the product of a public school education, but I have two Shamrock sons. Mod-Xrawv sounds like Mothra &amp;amp; Gamera's frat bro.  
Plain-Xrawv sounds like something I could order at Jamba Juice.

 So anyone can start a subreddit and delete/not approve messages from posters they don't like? So anyone can start a subreddit and delete/not approve messages from posters they don't like? MOD-xrawv, care to answer MrMckracken's question?

MrMckrack, who were you on EB?  If you don't want to say, that's fine. Not sure what you mean? Most likely the only things that will need to be moderated are racist comments as we go along. You've read the sidebar, right? Thing is, I don't recall any of those types of examples listed at the right being used on EB. It was pretty civil there.

And does that apply to bigotry, intolerance, discrimination, prejudice, xenophobia or bias of any sort against ANY heritage? Thats because the mods on EB deleted the posts really quick. They didn't come close to those examples. I beg to differ. I personally called in dozens of racist remarks that were deleted or the users themselves were deleted. Yup, there were a few that bagged on folks of European heritage, and they were sacked. Anyone else want to talk?  I'm being told what and how to post. Whatchoo wanna talk about? Hey there.  Mind saying who you were on EB, or do you want a fresh start?  Also, would your Dad ever say that his daughters had great legs?   I hear Kenji's sons have nice pecs. That's something Ruthie would say. Hey there.  Mind saying who you were on EB, or do you want a fresh start?  Also, would your Dad ever say that his daughters had great legs?   Whatchoo wanna talk about? Fresh start's good.  EB cracked me up.  We all hoped our posts were more cupcake than rum fruitcake. 

Edit:  See, I didn't do that "child" thing.  I'm calling it chile (posting as a reply) from now on.  Prolly bad reddiquette.  Cupcakes are those who weren't native to the City, went to a Big 10 school and migrated here for work, not knowing what urban living is all about. They all move to Lake View and North Center because they can't afford Lincoln Park and think that they're living "da life". There's a few of them in r/Chicago, but it's easy to ignore them there by not reading the posts.

I didn't do the chitlin thing either, but word morph all you like. 

As far as Reddiquette goes, meh. This is a small subReddit. Just about anything goes until Kenjoe yanks a chain. I just learned about cupcakes.

After the corporate firewall blocked access to EB for a time, I'd keep up with the hot topics through thread subscriptions. Miss that..... 

And during the City Council's Infrastructure Trust vote, Chris from Albany Park and I ran the live feed of the meeting from the Clerk's website with running commentary on EB. Kind of a play by play. Frustrating and fun at the same time......

Ah well. It was great while it lasted. I'll check into it's successor and this place from time to time. For the moment, neither is as useful as EB.

On to other things....projects at work, &amp;amp; race season will be WFO shortly. Missed that live feed w/commentary--didn't know about it.

I know WikiBlock is up, but I don't get why they won't say who's behind it.

Check in with a new thread once in a while.  If you find a better replacement, let me know.  The Big K has done a lot to get us to Reddit.  Some of us are here now, and to be frank, I've posted some comments and none have turned into conversations.

On EB I could post a 5-letter sentence and start a convo.

I'll keep giving it a try, but if it stays like this, what's the use?  K, think about posting under the main thread.  Would like to see what a long thread looks like ala EB.

We were more than one person early on in EB.  Then 2.  Then 1.

There are ways to change it but for right now don't bitch. If I gave you the info on how to change it it could add more probs than blasted retinas. Get some Reddit experience then we'll talk. &amp;lt;sits on hands&amp;gt; "Get some Reddit experience then we'll talk."

Very Dennis Farinaesque.   Somehow I missed the Breakfast thread and was just starting to read it when EB went kerplunk.  Missed most of those recs too. Yellow Rose was the last spot discussed.  Rave reviews and there was a meetup a brewing.  I'll get links or quotes later, but I was reading the EB farewell blog and somewhere in the middle of the comments, some knowledgeable person posted that EB was originally funded by a grant by a NFProfit foundation, Knight Publishing and that selling the project only to have it shut down by a commercial entity may have been against the rules/stipulations of the original grant.  Thought that was interesting.  That's an expensive project (over $1 million) to just be shelved.  Later I'll try to find exact quotes, links, etc.   I'll get links or quotes later, but I was reading the EB farewell blog and somewhere in the middle of the comments, some knowledgeable person posted that EB was originally funded by a grant by a NFProfit foundation, Knight Publishing and that selling the project only to have it shut down by a commercial entity may have been against the rules/stipulations of the original grant.

Also, I keep reading that there were no ads on EB, but everyday there to the end, I was staring at a little monkey's face from the Phillippines.  What was that?  They had ads. Did anyone think EB was ever going to make money for MSNBC or NBC? If NBC bought EB to get a leg up on other news orgs because EB was being heralded as the cutting edge techy (read cheap:  less journalists because users like us were creating content) direction for them, then I'm sure they didn't like for profit orgs like DNAinfo posting their headlines leading EB people away to their own monetized site.  DNAinfo creates their own content, I thought? Yes they do, but if you were NBC and you paid $1+ million dollars for it (I don't know the real sum), how would you feel about a newcomer like DNAinfo stealing peeps out of your own 10-staffed hyper-local investment? how did DNAinfo "steal" anything? You posted DNAinfo headlines with links taking EB users to DNA's site.  DNAinfo also posted their headlines on EB providing links.  DNA used a competitior's (MSNBC) site to draw their users to their own site.  If they "stole" anything it was "site visits" by EB peeps.  From my very limited knowledge of website analytics, website visits are what are used to determine web ad revenue on a site.  Analogy would be hard copy magazines and the stated circulation on front cover.  The mag's circulation determines the cost of an ad. EB's "revenue" was NBC money deposited into EB accounts to pay their salaries and pay their EB bills to stay up and running, there in Ravenswood.  

Add advertising dollars EB generated themselves on their website, as revenue too.

The advertising dollars weren't enough revenue to cover the 10 employees, plus the Ravenswood building's expenses.  I'm really missing the random posts by neighborhood folks.  I know I can get news from news outlets, but I'm missing the "blotter" type news like, "Someone Rifled through my Garage," or other stuff like, "What's up with that cranky bike shop?"  I guess this is the "hyper-local" content for which EB was designed. Anyone else miss Chicago Girl's scanner reports? she's a good person I'll miss her. Agree.  Typical, warm-hearted, funny NWSider. </snippet></document><document><title>Northwest Chicago Historical Society &#8226; Hosting a Meetup on February 24 2013</title><url>http://nwchicagohistory.org/events.html</url><snippet /></document><document><title>PPHH Pub Quiz</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/186xy3/pphh_pub_quiz/</url><snippet>Pub Quiz Benefit

My suggestion is to create a "dummy subreddit" using a different name than what you really want. Set it up, use it as a practice place, a sandbox. Invite a bunch of people to play/test in that group for a little while so you can get the hang of moderating it. Once you are comfortable go and create your PPHH subreddit.

There's all kinds of interesting features. You can even make your subreddit only be seen by "members" so it's not a public subreddit.

There's apps for mobile devices too, just for Reddit. I've been playing around with Alien Blue for iOS. Strange, I do not have a link to "create a community"?

Perhaps most attending were "alright" with that, but many would like to see more being done. A particular concern of several questioners was response times to reported crime &amp;amp; what they thought was inept handling of calls by the 911 center. I called 911 last week for an incident on my block.  Response time was less than 4 minutes, four cars responding.  Not only appropriate response time for the call but even better than I expected.    so does that mean we are alright with that?  </snippet></document><document><title>Live concert at The Portage Theater Tonight:  ANTISERUM AND ELFKOWITZ</title><url>http://www.portagetheater.com/Events/200/live-concert-antiserum-and-elfkowitz/</url><snippet>   Great, this concert looks like a result of the new ownership? Hard to say.  There are a lot of restrictions on the liquor license, and IIRC, there is no "sharing" of the profits from alcohol sold for an event.

IE Carranza can book the event, but the money from liquor sales goes to the holder of the license, which is Dennis in this case.

Considering the fact that Carranza's most likely in deep shit with the City over the goings on at the Congress? I doubt he'd try to get stupid now.  But, then again, who knows. It's Mr. BiPolarity we're talking about here. Great, this concert looks like a result of the new ownership? There's been electronic dance music concerts at Portage for a long while now. I'm pretty sure Eddie Carranza had nothing to do with promotion or running the event last night. I had no idea what this music was and so I clicked on Facebook page last night to check it out....it looked like a bunch of teen-boppers from the suburbs attending the concert.  Lots of posts about - I need a ride from Glyn Ellen, etc.  Pretty funny. That's what we want here. Suburban folks spending their cash here, having a fine time, then quietly and safely leaving our neighborhood to get home.

Fair enough, in all honesty, I likely wouldn't have even realized there was something going on there if not for having seen this earlier that day. I heard a few louder than usual small groups walking to the theater that night, but nothing out of the ordinary, and there didn't seem to be any trouble as a result of it either. Nope no issues whatsoever. I saw Mark on Milwaukee Ave., the morning after, and he said all went well. Peacefest is next at the Portage. </snippet></document><document><title>Welcome to r/greatNWside!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/184vbr/welcome_to_rgreatnwside/</url><snippet>Now that [Everyblock](http://blog.everyblock.com/2013/feb/07/goodbye/) is gone we've created this subreddit to bring all Northwest Side neighborhoods under one roof here on Reddit.

 Red chair was out earlier. Wasn't tonight though. its still sitting in the parkway I think when the vehicle pulls up he/she whips it up on the parkway. It was on dry asphalt yesterday but I couldn't stop and pull over to grab it. I wasn't home all day so I didn't see it.  She didn't put it out last night which I was kind of shocked that she didn't.  if you ever want to see some action, park there and see what happens  lol   So I guess this starts at State and Madison and runs to Lake Geneva?

Missy, I'd go an get a small order, like 1/4 lb, of fish chips to see if you like the flavors before trying to serve a ton of people. Make sure you like it first.  I've only gotten the Gulf shrimp Chicago style. Ok - you are all right...I should try it first :).  Altho trying to feed my two younger bro's who love fried anything.  I will run over tonight and pick it up.  Shrimp were good.  Their scallops are not a finger food.  Ocean perch is a bit too fishy.  Red sauce is nice but why do they even bother with the packets of tarter sauce.  I need to get some horseradish. I never order "ocean perch" anywhere. Try the cocktail sauce or did you have the mild or hot sauce? I got the mild and the hot sauce.  My taste buds are a bit different when it comes to hot.  I just had two left over cold scallops for breakfast.  Yummy, but I would not call either sauce hot.  One just seems to have more horseradish. Shrimp were good.

My office will be closed Monday, Feb. 18, in honor of Washington's Birthday.&#160;We will reopen at 8 am Tuesday, Feb. 19.&#160;
City Council Update
I want to give you a quick update on a couple of items from this week's city council meeting.&#160;

First, the city council&#160;unanimously&#160;passed additional ethics reforms. The reforms further define and&#160;strengthen&#160;the roles of the Inspector General, Legislative Inspector General, and Board of Ethics. The ordinance also&#160;prohibits lobbying by former aldermen for a year after they leave office.&#160;

I voted for the ordinance, but I believe it should have gone further. The ordinance originally proposed by the administration included provisions to allow&#160;anonymous ethics complaints against aldermen. Such complaints are already allowed against city employees.&#160;

Despite the fact that the anonymous provisions were stricken from the ordinance, it is an improvement. I will continue to support any changes that help&#160;strengthen ethics and restore trust in city government.&#160;

At the same city council meeting, I introduced a resolution calling for hearings into the site selection process for red light cameras. 23 other aldermen signed onto the resolution.&#160;

The original intent of the cameras was to improve traffic safety, and I support that goal. However, recent allegations of unethical behavior by the program vendor make me concerned that camera sites were selected based on how much revenue they would generate, not how much safer that would make our roads.&#160;

The resolution asks that Chicago Department of Transportation officials be prepared to discuss how sites are selected,&#160;who takes part in making those decisions, and&#160;what data is examined. 

Hopefully, we'll get some answer so that we can ensure that this tool makes our roads safer and isn't used simply to generate revenue.&#160;

Thanks
I want to thank&#160;the students from Schurz High School who took time out of their day off school Tuesday to show almost 200 seniors a good time during my Senior Valentine's Dance. It was great to see so many young people mixing and mingling with our seniors.&#160;

I also want to thank Heck's Catering on Milwaukee Avenue for donating their fantastic food. A great time was had by all. We've already started planning for next year.&#8232;&#8232;&#160;The City is Hiring

Free FAFSA Help
Applying for federal financial aid for college can be a complicated process. But City Clerk Susanna Mendoza and the Ladder Up Financial Liberation program are working to make it easier.

Mendoza and Ladder Up are offering free help for families&#160;navigating&#160;the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Help is&#160;available&#160;every Tuesday from Feb. 5 to April 9, from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm at City Hall, 121 N. LaSalle, Room 107.

To complete the application, the student and his or her parents or spouse must provide the following: Social Security numbers; birthdates; alien&#160;registration/permanent resident cards, if the student is not a citizen; completed 2012 tax returns and any earning statements for the student, parents, and spouse, if applicable; information on untaxed income; checking and savings&#160;balances; other asset information; and a list of colleges to which the student is applying.&#160;
