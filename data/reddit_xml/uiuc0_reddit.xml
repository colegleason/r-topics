This time though, instead of a match with only 1-2 people, perhaps a speed-dating type event would be a cool twist.

Everything is still in the planning phases right now though. To get a sense of what the turnout would be, if you're reading this and think you would be interested in taking part, would you fill out this quick survey?

Ideally, it would happen in about a month from now (March 30th?), which should be enough time to book a room and get all of the materials made.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment.
  We could just hold a raffle for who gets to date me for 20 minutes. Why do you hate Moruitelda?

All I know is that he hates smokers. We could just hold a raffle for who gets to date me for 20 minutes. In that case I suspect /u/Moruitelda will buy all the raffle tickets.  "So, do you reddit?"

"Yup."

"Well, uh, would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?"

"*Cough*"  Probably really need to work on the gender disparity.  I'm guessing the last one's girl:guy ratio was a little low? From what I read in the other thread it was 5:2.  From what I read in the other thread it was 5:2.  I like those odds From what I read in the other thread it was 5:2.  5 girls for every 2 guys? Or was it the other way? take a wild guess  This sounds fun, but I have a few questions about how the last dating match-up worked. Were there many LBGT persons involved? I am a bisexual female, and I would love it if there were other lesbian and bisexual women participating. I've been finding it incredibly difficult to find women to date.</snippet></document><document><title>Old video of Green St./Campus</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/197utg/old_video_of_green_stcampus/</url><snippet>I remember seeing an old video (probably shot in like the 70's) of Green St and campus.

 That's awesome! Only ten years and it's changed so much. &amp;gt;Only ten years and it's changed so much.

That feel when you realize 1994 was nearly twenty years ago. For me, it's all about movies. I was born 8 years after Star Wars came out, and it was my favorite movie for a long, long time. I watched it hundreds of times. 

That feel when I realize that The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be to my child what the Star Wars trilogy was to me. Except older. And that, to my child, Star Wars will be as old as It's A Wonderful Life is to me. 

That Jurassic Park and Independence Day will be the equivalents of Hondo or the Great Escape. 

The Lion King will be 19 years old when my child is born. That's older than The Jungle Book was when I was born. 

Life just slips away, and there's nothing you can do about it. fuck, that's heavy stuff man. as if I weren't feeling enough feelings already. &amp;gt;Only ten years and it's changed so much.

EMERGENCY DEAN?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/198e5l/help_emergency_dean/</url><snippet>hey so i need to contact the emergency dean about missing classes due to my grandfather passing away. what do i do? what happens? what sort of documentation do i give them if i need to give them anything?   I was in the hospital a few years ago and the emergency dean came and visited me.  She took down my professors' and my boss' email addresses and took it from there.  I guess just told them that I would be absent for a while, but I didn't have to do anything.  Once I got out, it was my responsibility to talk to my teachers and figure out any missed work.   okay that does help a little but does anyone have any experience with a family death? i'm not sure what i need to give her or if i just email her? They really just want proof that you were actually missing classes due to a family death and not just ditching. An obituary from the paper (if you share a last name or if it mentioned you by name), a memorial/prayer booklet, something from the hospital/cemetery, or any other document that shows you were dealing with the death of your grandfather should be sufficient. The Emergency Dean will work with you to get that all sorted out.  When my buddy passed away a few years ago I just brought them the prayer card and they took that as proof. They were always super understanding with me. thanks. think the obituary would work? the prayer card i left at home and getting a death certificate might take weeks :\ </snippet></document><document><title>University of Illinois alumnus Ang Lee wins Academy Award for Best Director for "Life of Pi"!</title><url>http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-oscars-2013-ang-lee-wins-best-director-prize-20130220,0,6165513.story</url><snippet>  he is definitely an Illini.

This happened to me last year because I had "loud" music. I had nobody over so I opened the door. All he did was tell me to put it down while looking over my shoulder to see what was going on behind me. It was not overly loud but you could probably hear it from the hallway. Is that valid reason for a police office to have probable cause or even enough for him to request a warrant? Do I open for him or wait for him to leave?

Thoughts?   Keep all booze away from the door. Keep the door locked and move all of the beer / liquor out of plain sight. Walk outside and shut the door behind you. Comply with all requests  ( turn the music down, keep you hands out of your pockets etc) but do not consent to a search unless everyone is 21 and it is all legit.  If you open the door and a girl is passed out on the floor they will have probable cause to enter. &amp;gt; do not consent to a search unless everyone is 21 and it is all legit.

Just don't consent to a search in any case. It's a better idea.  With Unofficial once again upon us, it's time for EVERYONE to rewatch [this gem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc) about your rights when interacting with the cops.

How hard will it be to switch into Mechanical when I arrive next fall?   It won't be a problem as long as you have a good gpa.  I have a friend who did this too, but he struggled with a couple classes freshman year and his gpa wasn't high enough for him to transfer into the major.  He really likes Engineering Mechanics now though, and the majors aren't too different.  Engineering Mechanics takes a lot more of the theory behind all the processes though, so be prepared for a lot of math (which is really the best part of engineering).  Also, you aren't allowed to switch until the end of freshman year.  I switched from General Engineering to Civil Engineering with no problem at all, the process isn't hard, it's just the GPA requirement for mechanical engineering that makes it difficult.

I was recently admitted to a graduate program at UIUC. I will be getting married before the program begins. 

I am wondering if you all had any suggestions for places to live that are a bit nicer than some of the cheap/efficiency type housing that I saw a lot of while visiting. Looking for a 2 bed and 1.5-2 bath house, apartment, or townhome rental. 

Any suggestions?

Thank you!      I lived in Orchard Downs for a bit and I have to say it is an extremely safe starting point. I lived there for about a year with my wife when we got here, casually looking for better places. It's ridiculously cheap for its quality (you can get 2bedroom places which are fine as long as you put something up to cover the cinder block walls), and they are very nice about letting you get out of your lease early (in the summer anyway) if you find someplace you would rather be. 

Think about it this way: if you are in a new city and you need a hamburger, you are probably going to go to Burger King to keep your risk down until you know more about the local burger place. Orchard Downs is the same idea -- standardized, low-variance, 40th percentile housing that is a safe starting place. &amp;gt; if you are in a new city and you need a hamburger, you are probably going to go to Burger King to keep your risk down until you know more about the local burger place.

Nah. I&#8217;d visit Yelp, type in &#8220;hamburger&#8221;, and immediately get a crowdsourced opinion of the best hamburger in town (Farren&#8217;s, by the way). No need to fall back on the safe choice. Likewise, OP is crowdsourcing a housing decision so he or she doesn&#8217;t have to move again soon after getting into town.       </snippet></document><document><title>Surviving Police Encounters on Unofficial</title><url>https://www.facebook.com/events/308954109227643/</url><snippet>  TL;DR Cause this is really important.

The actual writing part tends to be more coding based but has some conceptual stuff like figuring out the order in which a process would execute. It also changes a bit from semester to semester.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any documents/interviews/photographs or any primary sources like that which would show the history of Murphy's (it was established here in 1969 so I know there has to be something). Or if you know someone who know's the history of it that I could interview. Thanks reddit!  I would suggest just asking a bartender there if any management might be willing to spend 10 minutes of their time answering a few questions. Worst that can happen is they say no.

Back during my time at UIUC (1996-2000 and lived in the area a few years after), Murphy's was still smaller - basically just one long room. It expanded into whatever was next door (memory escapes me now) sometime while I was down there.

In the early days, they were most known for their awesome burgers and fresh cut fries -- the entire wall near the entrance was lined with boxes of fresh potatoes stacked several feet high, etc.  It was a divey / dumpy place with awesome bars and a laid back atmosphere.

After it expanded, it changed a bit, but although it sort of "yuppified" a little bit, it was still more a chill out and have conversation w/friends over beers kind of place, not a get smashed and dance kind of place.  I hope/suppose that's still the case today.

Not sure if it's still the case, but they used to give away souvenir glasses of whatever beer(s) was/were on special on Wednesday nights, which was pretty cool.

Man, I miss their burgers and fries...

Edit: I'm not kidding, CS kids love Murphy's, and one of the older grad students is bound to be perfect for you to interview 7.5 / 10 3/10 3/10 3/10   I worked there for a few years (2009 to 2011) and was an assistant manager, if you have any specific question you can PM me. I do know that about ~2 years ago, me and some other guys I worked with cleaned out the old office in the alley that they had used for the previous 15 years. They didn't keep a lot of the documents or other things hanging around but some of us that helped got a few posters, neons, old tshirts, and such. You could try to talk to management but they aren't always the nicest people when it comes to certain things so I'm not sure if they would be willing to help with this or not.

I do know among the old photographs I have seen were some ones of the Budweiser clydesdales drinking beer out of a bucket back in the 70s, so there is a lot of history there. do you know where these photographs are at? are they hanging in Murphy's or are they in storage?    </snippet></document><document><title>Champaign IL State Rep.

Representative Brown-
I'm not going to try to change your mind on gay marriage; rather, I have several issues with how you recently defended your position in the press and how you perceive the issue in general. You are quoted as saying: "&#8220;I would say 99 percent of my constituency, those who have contacted me, is against gay marriage...My job is to represent my constituents and uphold what they believe.&#8221;

First, exaggeration fools nobody. It is statistically impossible that so many of your constituents agree with you, especially in county that voted heavily Democrat in the previous Presidential election. You know this. I realize you qualified the statement with "those who have contacted me"--you should expect a lot of dissenting contacts in the near future. 

Second, you shouldn't be allowed to hide behind you constituency's imagined wished in this instance because people's rights should never be put to a vote in the first place. Morality, misguided or otherwise, has no place as the basis for deciding a person's worth as a citizen and a human being; otherwise, what are we left with besides tyranny of the (incredibly slim yet vocal) majority? When gay marriage is legalized it will not be because it is a right grudgingly given, but rather a long-standing oppression finally removed. There is a difference.

What consoles me and, I suspect, gay people across the state and around the country, is that despite your obstruction, it simply doesn't matter very much in the long run. Gay marriage will be legal nationwide, and soon. Those who oppose it are simply on the wrong side of history, and every day of delay may be disappointing, insulting, painful...but nothing more than that: a delay. Human dignity and love will win out, and you'll be left to explain your support of intolerance to your grandchildren.

As I said before, expect many more emails along these lines. If you're an honest man, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, I'd expect you to stand up and defend your position without hiding behind what you've chosen to pretend that your constituents believe.  Sent this:

Second, you shouldn't be allowed to hide behind you constituency's imagined wished in this instance because people's rights should never be put to a vote in the first place. Morality, misguided or otherwise, has no place as the basis for deciding a person's worth as a citizen and a human being; otherwise, what are we left with besides tyranny of the (incredibly slim yet vocal) majority? When gay marriage is legalized it will not be because it is a right grudgingly given, but rather a long-standing oppression finally removed. There is a difference.

What consoles me and, I suspect, gay people across the state and around the country, is that despite your obstruction, it simply doesn't matter very much in the long run. Gay marriage will be legal nationwide, and soon. Those who oppose it are simply on the wrong side of history, and every day of delay may be disappointing, insulting, painful...but nothing more than that: a delay. Human dignity and love will win out, and you'll be left to explain your support of intolerance to your grandchildren.

As I said before, expect many more emails along these lines. If you're an honest man, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, I'd expect you to stand up and defend your position without hiding behind what you've chosen to pretend that your constituents believe.  This is a great letter but have you checked that he is actually your representative? If he isn't, even the best letters will make no real difference.

Adam Brown represents the 102nd district which is far west Champaign (west of Duncan). Most of Champaign-Urbana is the 103rd district and our representative is Naomi Jakobsson, who is a democrat and in my opinion a pretty neat lady overall. Sent this:

Representative Brown-
I'm not going to try to change your mind on gay marriage; rather, I have several issues with how you recently defended your position in the press and how you perceive the issue in general. You are quoted as saying: "&#8220;I would say 99 percent of my constituency, those who have contacted me, is against gay marriage...My job is to represent my constituents and uphold what they believe.&#8221;

First, exaggeration fools nobody. It is statistically impossible that so many of your constituents agree with you, especially in county that voted heavily Democrat in the previous Presidential election. You know this. I realize you qualified the statement with "those who have contacted me"--you should expect a lot of dissenting contacts in the near future.

Yeah...so I started to fire off an e-mail to the guy, but then I read this thread and kinda double checked the district boundaries... [this is the 102nd district](http://i.imgur.com/86RHf5m.jpg) according to the State Board of Elections interactive map (which requires Silverlight for ridiculous reasons). Almost none of it is in CU. These towns are REALLY in the boonies. 

Sending off a deluge of e-mails might have good intentions, but he'll be able to easily brush it off as meddling from college liberals from Champaign. To be honest, considering the area I think his "99% of constituents" claim is more credible than not.  This is a noble effort, but misguided. His statement could be accurate, as he may represent more rural members of the community. Odds are, you aren't his constituents because 

a: most of you are only temporary residents of Champaign-Urbana for school.

b: if you want to make the argument that state representatives should represent even temporary residents, most of you are probably covered by Naomi Jakobsson - who has already agreed to sign it. 

Her page is here, if you'd like to show your support - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Representative-Naomi-Jakobsson/109442605763187?ref=ts&amp;amp;fref=ts &amp;gt;This is a noble effort, but misguided.

No, it's not. Even if he's not your representative (he is mine), it's never misguided to tell someone that they need to stop being a homophobe or creating an institutionalized religious law in violation of the First Amendment. Well, you're sorta changing the argument here. You're talking about how we should send an email to Representative Brown on personal moral reasons. Got no problem with that.  

This post is about Representative Brown allegedly not knowing about his constituents' values, and that's what I was responding to. Most of the commenters here are likely NOT his constituents. While the 99% is most likely an exaggeration, he was re-elected by his constituents, suggesting there's more of a conservative streak among them.

Also, wouldn't it make more sense for out-of-town students to send letters to home/family representatives who don't support the bill?   I wrote him to advise him that I do not look kindly on commingling of religion and government, or institutionalized discrimination. I also advised him that if he votes this way, I will devote considerable amounts of time and money to defeating him in the next election. I finally reminded him that it's his job to represent all of his constituents, not just those organized by their churches in letter writing campaigns of ignorance and bigotry. 

It's unacceptable to be represented by a bigot or an ignoramus. We saw what happened to Jerry Schweighart when he came out as a birther. That's what we should do to Adam Brown. 

In the 1970's, the "Silent Majority" was conservative. Now it's liberal or moderate. At least in Illinois, it is.          Full disclosure: After posting this I tried to figure out how Brown, a Republican, could have ever been elected from CU. I'm not totally sure what the boundaries of his district are (I know Rep. Naomi Jakobsson is also a representative from Champaign).

The article doesn't do a good job specifying what Brown's actual district is either. He does have his district office in Champaign though for whatever reason: http://www.ilga.gov/house/Rep.asp?GA=98&amp;amp;MemberID=1978

In any case, him hearing from more marriage equality supporting people can't hurt. Based on the map scientific_derp posted the 102nd district starts west of Duncan, which happens to be where I'm from. A significant population lives in that part of town right outside of the city limits. 

edit: wrong number! I think you mean 102nd. Brown represents the 102nd district which is the area west of Duncan and very southern Champaign (possibly Savoy). Almost all of Chambana is within the 103rd district which is represented by Naomi Jakobsson. Very east sections of Urbana are 104th but I'm not positive who their rep is. Based on the map scientific_derp posted the 102nd district starts west of Duncan, which happens to be where I'm from. A significant population lives in that part of town right outside of the city limits. 

edit: wrong number! Ya that area tends to be fairly well off. Ironwood, Brittney Trails, Lincolnshire, Abbey Fields(crazy houses, relics from the Housing Boom). They tend to lean Republican. Although many professors live out there as well.  Based on the map scientific_derp posted the 102nd district starts west of Duncan, which happens to be where I'm from.

As most of you are probably aware, the PPACA has substantial implications for insurance and it will substantially impact our student insurance coverage. As for how, exactly, it will do so: We are still figuring that out.

These meetings are generally not well-attended, but this year  for reasons already stated, it is especially important for us to have your input, whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student, whether you are domestic or international.

So I urge you to please come this afternoon, make your voices heard, and help us make the appropriate recommendations, because your healthcare coverage and insurance costs might very well be changing.  Could you give some more detail?

Would this affect McKinley services and student health insurance?</snippet></document><document><title>Unofficial 2013 is this week. Stay safe and know your rights. (re-posting tips from last year's post)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1953kg/unofficial_2013_is_this_week_stay_safe_and_know/</url><snippet>From [last year's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/qbya6/lets_get_everyones_unofficial_tips_and_tricks_in/) (by /u/Dalimey100):

1. Safety first and don't be a dumbass, I don't want to see any of you awesome dudes in hospital or handcuffs.

2. If you are under 21, stay away from Green street, its crawling with cops and you can't get into bars now.

3. If you can, buy alcohol off campus. Its significantly cheaper. If you're &amp;lt; 21 and looking for someone to buy for you, ask someone to buy today or early tomorrow, nobody is going to want to buy stuff for other people on Friday.

4. Walk in groups. Crime happens, and there's no easier target than a lone drunkard. Know the numbers of the campus PD and saferides/walks 

5. [this](http://i.imgur.com/rdIBH.jpg) gives some great help for dealing with cops and general safety (thanks /u/Helpful_guy).

***

&amp;gt; Being drunk doesn't mean your behavior gets excused by everyone.


&amp;gt; Pace yourself. Eat lots. Don't forget about drinking water every once in a while to stay hydrated.


&amp;gt; Dont do simple dumb things, remember the age old rule "Do one illegal thing at a time" aka dont j-walk, climb shit, litter, etc.


&amp;gt; Another big thing is if you have a party to make sure no randoms are coming in. I was at a house party that was busted at Polar Bear (SIUC) this winter and the undercover cop was a woman posing as a sorostitute (minding she was a solid 8.5) so don't assume that kind of trickery does not happen here.


&amp;gt; I don't have any tips but the people who really lick their chops over unofficial are the tow truck drivers. If a sign says that you have to meet a certain criteria to be able to park (eg resident) don't risk it. You'll get towed.

Socially? Places to live? Eat? Study? Art program? Art scene?

Ideally I would be able to visit the campus before making my decision but since I am unable to make the trip from Florida I'm relying on you kind people of UIUC subreddit to tell me about your school!
   Congratulations! 

The arts scene is pretty great. I have some good connections in the art community, and if you want to talk privately, feel free to PM me. There are a lot of things to do, and many ways that you can get involved. There are some pretty great restaurants for such a small town. Lots of study places, depending on what you like. 

I'm originally from New York, but moved out here and am staying permanently. I like the town a lot. 

As far as places to live, it depends on your budget and what kind of experience you want. As a grad student, I was happier visiting campus than living on it. But a lot of my friends wanted to live on campus, and stayed there. In general, Urbana is slightly "artsier," and Champaign is more "businesslike," but there are great places in each town to live. There are a ton of rentals available in houses a mile or so west of campus. 

Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks! I'm pretty excited! I know I definitely want to live off campus but close by and ideally in the artsy-fartsiest part of town. In my current city I live in the historical/art district and I really love that sense of community that comes with the location. Is there an area of Urbana that is specifically central to the art scene? Also, how is parking on Campus? If it isn't ridiculously competitive perhaps I could live a little further away from campus than I originally thought and commute. </snippet></document><document><title>Found Wallet Sunday West of Bookstore</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/195le5/found_wallet_sunday_west_of_bookstore/</url><snippet>Hello uiuc reddit, I have found a wallet on campus that belongs to a girl named, Shannon Parish.

But seriously, this dude is batshit insane, his office looks like a tornado has gone through it (daily, for the past 10 years), and his lectures consist of incoherent rambling and him yelling at people. 

Am I getting my first taste of a terrible tenured professor?

Edit: I almost feel bad because he just offered to set up a phone conversation with someone who might have a question that may not be suited for email.   What room and time is this class? I'm tempted to sit in just for the experience. MWF, 11 am, MSEB 100. Try not to look him in the eye.   I had him for fluids and he once went off on a kid for asking a question while chewing gum. The man is a genius, and batshit insane is a great way to put it.  Pearlstein is an interesting character.

Had him for ME 300. He changed the problems in the book so that we would have to interpolate every value we got out of the charts for homework. He knew every ones name, and will hand your exam packets to you individually. For exams he will leave the room at the end of class and not accept any more tests after he has left (so get done early, it becomes the hunger games of people trying to put exams in his hands). I would feel like I learned something from each final (that I wished I had known when I was taking it). 

But I did shit on the first exams(thinking back i guess it was average just the grades as a whole were low), managed aced the final and he gave me a good grade in the class so it appears that if he sees you improve/try he can be lenient. I am fairly sure he sets the average to a C- or a C so have fun with that.     </snippet></document><document><title>Gave him a popchip outside the Union, and well, once he popped, he couldn't stop</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/XWtzFoV.jpg</url><snippet>  Don't feed the god damn squirrels...

I was planning on doing the whole 'backpacking through Europe after graduation' deal but don't have the money for that, and this looks like a cheaper option. I currently don't have any loans/financial aid and don't want to jump on that boat first off. Any suggestions or tips?   potatoes    I did a 6-week summer program in Hiroshima, Japan, back in 2010. Apart from my own money and some help from my parents, I was actually able to snag a few scholarships. 

* The honors program awarded me $1,000 for the trip. Thanks, CHP.
* I don't know which office you'll go through, but I studied through IPENG and thus was able to do a fellowship. I got half my airfare covered in exchange for a few volunteer hours and making a tri-fold poster for them to use at study abroad fairs. Things like that may not be available for short programs like what you want to do, but check with whichever office you use to see if they have anything like that.
* The I4I scholarships are great. I got one for $500 for having a "unique destination," but there are a whole bunch others. Check those out! Apply for them all!

Good luck! kinda a tangent, but how did you like the program? That's actually one of the programs I'm looking at, but I'm trying to gauge if it's worth a couple thousand in addition to a normal tuition year. i'm pretty apathetic about credits, i'm just looking to have a good experience over a summer (or semester) because I've never left the US. It was absolutely fantastic! None of us really knew any Japanese before we went there except a few phrases we'd picked up from anime, but we had a phenomenal Japanese teacher at HIT (the Japanese university), and immersion did wonders for us. (I came back knowing more than enough to test out of JAPN 201 here.) We also took a culture class and a few small engineering seminars that would meet anywhere from once the whole trip or twice a week. We were also able to shadow some of HIT's clubs -- we got to try out kendo, tea ceremony, taiko, and tons more.

They also took us on weekend outings . We took a day trip to Miyajima where we saw SO MANY DEER and got to climb (for many of us) our first mountain. Another weekend, we went to the city and saw the atomic bomb memorial and museum at the Peace Park. And yet another time we got to visit an okonomiyaki sauce factory and try our hand at making our own okonomiyaki. 

[Here's a photo of me climbing that mountain.](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/29322_401086946285_931246_n.jpg)

We also spent a ton of time shopping, going to karaoke, taking over arcades (seriously, 10 floors of games -- it was heaven), and drinking. We're still close with lots of the kids we met over there, and some of the Japanese kids have studied abroad here to get their own experience. 

**tl;dr** Program was AMAZING and I wish I had time and money to go back. Any more questions, ask away. :)  My sister is in Europe now. She worked. She also got scholarships but for the most part she used several years of her savings because it's a once in a lifetime thing. Pretty sure she's been to near twenty countries in her time there. How much money did she save up for it?   Gilman Scholarship. It's a 1 in 3 shot at up to 5,000 if you qualify.   </snippet></document><document><title>Carmike Movie Theater?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/193458/carmike_movie_theater/</url><snippet>When did Carmike close?

The one on north prospect is doing a total reconstruction, the whole thing will probably be torn down in a couple of weeks. Also, they're not getting an IMAX, they're getting whatever is one size smaller than an IMAX. I heard the whole thing wont be done until early-mid summer.

I got some buddies that work(ed) at the beverley theater that told me about this stuff. &amp;gt; they're not getting an IMAX, they're getting whatever is one size smaller than an IMAX. 

IMAX is about size? I always thought it had something to do with 3D, but now that I think of it, all IMAX theaters I have been to are huge. It's not really about "size", especially screen size. Yes, IMAX screens are larger, but can vary from theater to theater. What makes IMAX different is that they use larger film, with different cameras and projectors that lead to larger screen images and higher resolutions. So, the Beverly isn't getting a "smaller IMAX", but going with a different film format for their HD movies. &amp;gt; they're not getting an IMAX, they're getting whatever is one size smaller than an IMAX.

If you like barbecue, Black Dog in Urbana is really good. They also have a nice late night menu on the weekends from 10:30pm-2am. What this guy said. The Black Dog is my favorite restaurant. It is seriously good (real) barbecue. The only drawback is it is frequently packed.  And yet we continue to tell EVERYONE we can about it (I do so myself too). We should be smart and try to keep it secret. Haha If you like barbecue, Black Dog in Urbana is really good. They also have a nice late night menu on the weekends from 10:30pm-2am.  Farren's in downtown Champaign. It's easy to take the bus there. Seaboat on Kirby. Crane Alley in Urbana. Also easy to take the bus there.    You can never go wrong with Dos Reales.      I had Rainbow Garden and it was the best chinese food I have had near campus. Cravings has on and off days and is too much of a risk for me.   Chopstix for Chinese. Cravings! </snippet></document><document><title>Free Trap and Bass Show Tonight at Cowboy Monkey</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1937sp/free_trap_and_bass_show_tonight_at_cowboy_monkey/</url><snippet>Noticed a bunch of people getting in to trap music lately with the explosion of the harlem shake videos.

The ISS bought iClicker 2's, because some classes require the newer version. They cost $40 a piece.

Keep in mind that it's a loaner program, so the iClickers get returned in May and will be reused. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted]     If you rent something for free, it's not really "rent" anymore, is it?

I also don't know much about these stupid devices, but if every student is required to have one, wouldn't it be simpler for university to give it to students in a centralized way? You want to give a 40 (for new versions) and 20 (for old versions) to EVERY undergrad? That's far more than the money spent here. They could just rent them out for each class that requires them and make buying one optional. Put down a $20 deposit, return it at the end of the semester. You want to give a 40 (for new versions) and 20 (for old versions) to EVERY undergrad? That's far more than the money spent here. Maybe if the university has to pay for them instead of students, they will think twice about whether the clickers are actually useful? Why would the University agree to ever do that?  If you rent something for free, it's not really "rent" anymore, is it?

I also don't know much about these stupid devices, but if every student is required to have one, wouldn't it be simpler for university to give it to students in a centralized way?  Of course maybe the school shouldn't allow courses to use a glorified paperweight. iClickers are a good idea... if they're used properly.

Using them just to take attendance isn't that great of an idea (instead of forcing students to come to class, just ensure that lecture is a good use of their time), but using them to quickly assess if the class is understanding certain material is really nice. 

But this is a bit off the point of what the article is about anyway. Of course maybe the school shouldn't allow courses to use a glorified paperweight. Of course maybe the school shouldn't allow courses to use a glorified paperweight. And mandatory software packs, don't forget that wonderful innovation. Yeah... I bought the required courseware for a Mathematica class I'm in this semester. Haven't used it once. $25 wasted. You know you can use Mathematica for free via EWS computers, right? Yeah, this isn't the Mathematica program. It's just a bunch of lousy Mathematica files that are supposed to teach you how to use Mathematica.</snippet></document><document><title>Racial Intolerance on Campus</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/191hv7/racial_intolerance_on_campus/</url><snippet>I was walking on green and fourth and a couple of guys in a minivan started to yell out their window and say things like "Nice ass slumdog" or "Go back to your shitty country" etc. This didn't happen just once - they drove back and yelled more racially charged stuff. At this point, It seemed like it was way more than just a "joke" or a harmless prank because they actually turned around to come back and say more stuff.

How many of you guys have been subject to people talking to you like this? This isn't the first time this has happened to me so I'm curious about you others on here.  If you remember any identifying information, you might want to consider reporting it. Policies and procedures are listed in the [Campus Administrative Manual](http://cam.illinois.edu/ix/ix-b/ix-b-3.htm), with these excerpts about reporting procedures being relevant:

1. "Individuals alleging violation of the policies herein are encouraged to report the alleged violation immediately upon experiencing the alleged misconduct or learning of the alleged misconduct. Individuals reporting alleged or suspected violations of this policy during non-business hours or University designated holidays should contact the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access at (217) 333-0085 or diversity@illinois.edu, or the Emergency Dean at (217) 333-0050 for student-related matters." 

1. "Students alleging discrimination or harassment allegedly committed by a student in their capacity as a student may submit a report as specified in this policy or by contacting the Office for Student Conflict Resolution. Such complaints should be referred to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at (217) 333-3680 or conflictresolution@illinois.edu for investigation and resolution under the student disciplinary system procedures."

Not sure what will be the procedure if the offender is not a UIUC student/employee or if you don't know the person and can't identify them.  I'm asian and it's happened to me several times before. Sometimes they yell out of windows of cars or out of balconies. Idk why some idiots do this.   I'm asian, and I've never been treated like this. Next time this happens, I guess you can call the cops. But if you call the cops, how would it work? You call them and say some people shouted racial slurs from a moving vehicle? Are the cops going to try to find them and chase them in a police car? If they catch them, what will they do? Give them a warning or a ticket? Will they be charged with a crime? What crime? Will it be a misdemeanor? It's probably not worth your time to deal with people like that. But if you really wanted, calling the cops is one thing you can do. If victims started doing that, at least people would be more careful before they bully someone in public.

I'm not sure what the legal consequences would be if they get caught. But I'm guessing it will at least be treated like a verbal abuse or harassment. But if you call the cops, how would it work?

Next time this happens, I guess you can call the cops. i don't know so many minorities are so sensitive about racial issues. if someone said some bullshit to you, just ignore. 

the fact is, white people are the biggest victims of racists. because people think: "racist towards white people do not count as racist."  so even in public, minority people can tell racist jokes toward white people but white people can not do the opposite.

   By no means am I condoning their actions, or saying that you do this, but often you will see groups of people that are all of the same ethnicity. The most common is probably your pack of about 10 Korean girls all walking in a line, blocking the entire sidewalk and not speaking a word of English. This type of activity is just a target for people like the ones you mentioned.

For anyone who only hangs out with people with the same skin color as you - go out and meet everyone!

For anyone who only hangs out with people with the same skin color as you - go out and meet everyone!  Farm boys. Get out once in awhile. Nothing to do in the winter. Harmless. The farm boy from Fithian, IL who [attacked a Sri Lankan professor at Illinois Terminal](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/courts-police-and-fire/2011-12-08/bond-500000-attack-ui-professor.html) a year back was not all that harmless. You never know what they will do when they are [on meth](http://commercial-news.com/local/x1940557927/County-man-arrested-in-Champaign). Anyone on meth can be dangerous.  Now you're just being racially intolerant of farm boys. Racism + meth = Hate crime Anyone on meth can be dangerous.  Now you're just being racially intolerant of farm boys. It's not the same thing. Yes, anyone on meth is dangerous. However, when that person attacks you because of your race it means you are exposed to danger for your appearance not because you are anybody. What does any of this have to do with farms? There's a stereotype that people from rural areas are racially intolerant. I.e, farm boys will shout racial slurs at you from truck windows.  That's my point, lets stop racial intolerance by perpetuating other racial stereotypes, great plan! 'farm boys' is not a 'racial' stereotype
 If we're getting that specific,  "Go back to your shitty country" isn't racist either. 'farm boys' is not a 'racial' stereotype

In high school, you stay in one building the whole day long.  At least, that's how most schools where I grew up were.  (Also near Chicago.)  The only times I went outside were to get to the car to go to school, and getting out.  Or riding my bike to school on good days.  I swam, which meant that I was at school from before 6 until 6 pm.  So I actually didn't go outside much at all in high school.  Therefore, its easy for me to believe that she didn't experience weather much, although the phrasing was silly on her part.

Haha, I just saw this on the way home. Smartass. It did actually get me to smile, but then I just got mad.   Who controls these messages? I hope the CUMTD employee who posts here sometimes comes to tell us!  CJS7070 is on the right track. All buses are loaded with every possible route destination sign. This includes all of our fixed-routes as well as messages like "Not In Service," "Training Bus / Do Not Board," and the public relations messages you all are referring to. MTD Staff usually review the messages once a year and make edits as needed for a full fleet reload.

Operators punch in the code for the corresponding route they are driving. Dispatchers will alert the fleet if a "PR" message is to be added that day. An example is during home games, as darklinggg alluded to, MTD may decide to run the message "Beat Purdont" for the next day's football game against Purdue.

Drivers can act on their own will, and sense of humor, and in this case one chose to punch in "Smile It's Sunny" during yesterday's winter weather storm. Thanks for the interest and for riding MTD!  Who controls these messages? Who controls these messages? The driver. The mtd has a bunch of pre-loaded messages that the drivers can choose from using the console above their seat.        gr8 job</snippet></document><document><title>What my buddy and I did last night.</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/cO5VP7b.jpg</url><snippet>  </snippet></document><document><title>There is a tiny snowball man congregation on the quad worshipping their larger god.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/191heo/there_is_a_tiny_snowball_man_congregation_on_the/</url><snippet>I figured at least some of you guys would help add to it.
