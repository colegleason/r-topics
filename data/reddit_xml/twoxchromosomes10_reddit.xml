I absolutely love [this](http://store.apple.com/au_edu_94094/product/H9993ZM/A/michael-michael-kors-11-slim-saffiano-sleeve-for-macbook-air) one but it's a bit steep for what I was hoping to pay. I just want something really simple and elegant, black leather (faux leather okay). Every site I look at has really manly looking ones! 

Anyone have any recommendations of either cases very similar to the one above or stores that stock more feminine style cases?

Also, I'm in Australia so needs to ship internation/be an Australian based store. :)

Need some advice, recently moved to Rio, which is incredible and I absolutely love almost everything about this city.    
What I really don't love though is the constant daily abuse I get when walking around alone. I'm 5'11'' blonde, I say this only because thats quite rare here so I stand out like a sore thumb. Most people assume I'm a tourist so some will say something like *Hello pretty lady,* or *sexy* or some similarly creepy shit, but most just make strange noises and stare.    
I dress modestly, (even in 40&#186; heat) much more so than some people here who seem to be getting away with it. 
I hate to be complaining about this. I'm sure there's some that think I should shut up take it as a compliment but for me it's really far, far from it.     
I've never encountered this sort of shit before, in England (my homeland) you might get the odd arsehole making a comment but its pretty rare and then I'll usually stop and chat for a few minutes to try and make them see how rude and inappropriate they've just been. But here I have neither the time nor the language skills to do that to every letchy bastard I cross paths with.    
Unfortunately, Brazil's gender inequality is not going to change anytime soon, so I need some help to rise above it.    
Any advice welcome, x    
        
**UPDATE** You are all excellent human beings, thanks for the support. I'm sorry to hear this is such a huge problem. I shall work on my 'fuck you face' and failing that might just dress as a man.    Oh if you're interested, here's my [blog](http://cariocajoker.blogspot.com.br) where I chronicle all the madness I see before me. Peace  I'm a Canadian and I lived in South America from when I was 11 to when I was 18. 

The first piece of advice I was given when I arrived there was to ignore the men. Men will stare. They will cat call. They will throw out silly English phrases. They will do anything it takes to get your attention. I hate to tell you this, but there is nothing you can do about it. I dealt with this same thing from when I was 11 all the way to the end of high school, when I moved again, and the thing is, this behaviour is considered perfectly acceptable throughout the vast majority of Latin America. Hoots and whistles on the street were, honestly, the most tolerable part of the overall problem for me. 

I'm sorry that you're going through this. It really is a painful thing to endure, and I wish I had a more permanent, satisfying solution. The only thing I can stress is DO NOT GIVE THEM THE TIME OF DAY. Don't even look at them.  You are not an object. You are a human being. The best way to strike back is to ignore them completely. Well, the best *legal* way. 

Try not to let it get you down. I know how hard it is, but don't let them win. Don't let them upset you, don't let them ruin your day. When it happens, just shrug to yourself, say "fuck it" and keep walking. 

/hugs This redditor is right you have to ignore... it's part of the culture and you won't change it. It will change over time. 

Also while in the U.S. cat calling and staring will mark you as a weirdo because here it's not something you do. Over there it's not such a big deal so many of the men who do that don't think anything of it and don't even think it bothers you. They might think you actually like it, because guess what, many women over there DO like it. Again, it's a different culture. 

Talk to the brazilian women around you(not just the upper middle class snobs) and you will find a casual attitude about it.

Have you ever been to south Florida?!?!?! All they do down here is cat call and honk horns and throw their business cards at you while you are riding your bike back from publix (yeah, that happened). I like to go with the classy "go fuck your mother" retort.

 I live in south florida and yes i've seen greasy losers with gold chains going 'hey baby baby baby baby baby" trying to to "holla" at the beach.
 
But the U.S. as a whole is not like that. I don't know where you ride your bike but out here in west broward it's pretty tame. &amp;gt;Also while in the U.S. cat calling and staring will mark you as a weirdo because here it's not something you do.

 (I'm sure you probably know this but) south Florida has a big cultural influence from Latin America.

Also, a good solution for the business card being thrown at you is to put their number on the male for male section of Craigslist :D (I'm sure you probably know this but) south Florida has a big cultural influence from Latin America.

/hugs There *has* to be something else we girls can do. Ignoring them just tells them to *try harder*.

I mean... wear a helmet with a wig on it or something. Make them think you're mentally disabled. Catcall them back. ... *Something*, other than ignoring them, which only feeds the mentality that their behavior is okay and thus contributes to the problem. [deleted] Yeah, I'm totally naive about men taking responsibility for their own douchebaggery, I admit, but there has to be a solution that sits better with my violent feminazi rage than "oh, just ignore him, he doesn't know any better." You know what? He does know better. He knows that when he catcalls you he's making you feel objectified and vulnerable to violence because of that objectification. He's affecting your life from outside your bubble and he fucking knows it, and rather than use that power for good, to do a good deed and brighten someone's day, he's using it to make someone feel controlled. You alter your behavior for him. You change the way you dress. You dye your hair. You do anything he wants you to do.

That guy -- seriously, *fuck that guy*; that guy deserves so much worse than to just be ignored, which is only encouraging him. Look, your logic makes perfect sense, and you're completely right, except that it doesn't work at all in Latin America. 

Our *study abroad office* at our university told us we would be catcalled on the streets and that we had to just ignore it. It's completely integrated into their society. Boys are taught from a young age that this is how you talk to and treat women. It just *is*. And as foreigners, especially foreigners typically living in these countries for brief stints of time, it really isn't fair for us to impose our eurocentric experiences on their culture. These men aren't going to understand if we walk up to them and tell them all about how they're oppressing women with their actions. They'll just think we're crazy foreigners and turn right around and do it again.

This isn't to say that it shouldn't change and that it couldn't change, but challenging every knucklehead on the street is no way to survive in a Latin American country. You do what the natives do, you keep your head up, your eyes forward, and you move on. I just don't think it's "eurocentric" to self-evaluate. Every major culture and religion uses the basic underlying "golden rule:" treat others as you wish to be treated. It is most certainly *not* a part of their culture to abuse others as they see fit without expecting to endure a bit of that abuse themselves right back.

Punish the behavior. Find a way that works and use it. Take out your cell phone and snap a photo of them, and post it on a web site. Ask them for their names. Ask for their supervisors if they're on the job while they're catcalling. Ask for their parents, since they are behaving like children, or their owners, since they are behaving like dogs. Shame them. They should feel ashamed of their behavior. Make sure it happens. Don't just sit there complicit in their actions because it reinforces their behavior.

ANY OPTION is preferable to REINFORCING THE BEHAVIOR. Anything at all. There *has* to be something else we girls can do. Ignoring them just tells them to *try harder*.

I mean... wear a helmet with a wig on it or something. Make them think you're mentally disabled. Catcall them back. ... *Something*, other than ignoring them, which only feeds the mentality that their behavior is okay and thus contributes to the problem. I have only one upvote against the tide. I'm not sure I agree with you, but the ensuing conversation is definitely worth reading. I'm one of those opinionated bitches they call *uppity*. It's not sunshine and roses in real life, either; I'll take my downvotes.

I'm actually pretty surprised that it turned out this way, though. I guess I'm too used to the crowd of the feminist subreddits; I thought they overlapped a bit more with this one. There *has* to be something else we girls can do. Ignoring them just tells them to *try harder*.

I mean... wear a helmet with a wig on it or something. Make them think you're mentally disabled. Catcall them back. ... *Something*, other than ignoring them, which only feeds the mentality that their behavior is okay and thus contributes to the problem. Doing this would make them change who *you* are. Just give it what it deserves, which is nothing.  I guess that's where we disagree: I do not think this behavior should go unnoticed or unpunished. I think this behavior is egregiously *wrong*; it is inherently threatening, it creates a hostile world for women to live in where they are constantly dehumanized and more susceptible to violence, and it encourages low expectations of men. He couldn't help himself, they always say. Boys will be boys.

Fuck that noise. I will *throw a rock* before I contribute to societal oppression one more time. I've done it my whole life and I will stop doing it if it's the thing that finally gets me killed. What you don't realize is that reacting is REWARDING the behavior.  So my only options are to either perpetuate it or to reward it? A catcaller is not a child throwing a temper tantrum. Regardless of the age of a person, you can still choose to reward or punish or ignore behavior.  What would the punishing option look like? Ignoring we've covered, rewarding them is chastising or throwing rocks/getting violent. What is punishing?  "Sai foda cachorro" is a good place to start...

I love Rio, but had a similar experience, coming from the UK it was a major shock to the system. The thing I found about Brazilian men is that some of them play a game of numbers - they chat up as many women as possible to see what they can get, I've seen men approach 10 women after another and get turned down, but they keep on going. Brazilian women are BRUTAL with their put downs, they look at these men with total disgust and say horrible things back to them - which as a Brit I found really difficult to do at first, but you get used to it.

The major difference I found between Brazilian and British men is when you turn them down though - Brazilian guys generally take it really well as they are used to it happening all the time. So when you tell one to piss off he will! British men don't play this game, so when they try it on and you turn them down its a huge deal for them. 

I don't want to try to defend their behaviour at all, and you shouldn't have to put up with it, but it is much more culturally ingrained for them to do this. If you don't feel confident swearing at them in Portuguese why not have a laugh and get creative with English swearing? "Bawsack" is a personal favourite!

Abracos grande amiga! Tem uma tempo marvalhioso no Rio! "Sai foda cachorro" is a good place to start...

This is how I react most of the time. I can't help it. It works too. But I know how to fight and I work out so I might have more confidence than some women. Don't mouth off unless you know how to throw a one two punch. I have known a few Brazilian ladies and they are very tough. Like, they brawl in high heels and shit. I was impressed.  American living in Peru here, and I definitely feel your pain. I think about it this way; the most important things are my safety and doing my job here. Bridging the gender equality gap is noble, but literally, not your job. If you try to take it upon yourself to do it, it may seem self-righteous. Face it, when gender equality comes to Brazil, it will be because of strong Brazilian women rising up to demand it, not a gringa preaching to some jerks on a street corner. You keep yourself safe, do your job, spin up on your Portugese and support Brazilian women in making their country more equal.  American living in Peru here, and I definitely feel your pain.

I got catcalled wearing jeans and a jacket. Ignore them. They are not representative of the best part of the population. 

Edit: to clarify my statement, I meant that OP should keep in mind that when she goes out, yep she's going to get catcalled by let's say 10 guys per trip. But she will pass 130 on the way to school, and the rest of the people are probably really nice. Yes, they belong to the same culture, but there will be really polite young men, students, shopkeepers, bus drivers, vendors, people everywhere... and it's easy to be intimidated by the small percentage of the young men who make rude cat-calls. Don't be afraid to talk to the rest of the population if you need to. If you ask a dude for directions he will most likely be helpful if he can, not make nasty comments.

I know you're real touchy about your sister getting murdered, but, I mean, that guy didn't represent the best part of the population. Are you seriously comparing cat calls to murder?  The catcaller should recognize the ties his behavior has with violence against women. If you look at a woman and see an object, rather than a person, it shouldn't particularly bother you to harm that woman. And it doesn't.

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/12/1119353/-Objectifying-Women-Not-A-Progressive-Value

Catcalling is a symptom of a society that objectifies and dehumanizes women, and, consequently, is violent toward them. They're not the same *thing*, they're not equally reprehensible, they're just part of the same monster. You don't fight with every survivalist instinct and adrenaline rush you have against the dick of a man who is trying to rape you and simply ignore his arms because there is nothing you can do about them. Like, yeah, sorry your car got knicked by a hit-and-run driver, and all, but... just ignore it; that person isn't representative of the best part of the population.

Although I knew there wouldn't be a definitive solution. What I wonder though, is why every Brazilian woman is kicking up a shitstorm about this, I understand cultural differences and all that but its hard to adjust. I haven't yet seen any feminist action in Brazil. Carnival was (amazing, of course but) slightly appalling to note the practice of [grabbing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfzaMO5nJ6E)  and holding on to a girl until she submits and kisses you is not unique to gypsies in west london carparks. I've actually got a bruise on my arm from one particularly persistent guy. My brazilian mate had to pull him off me, (then me off him as I was ready to castrate the scumbag). It's all very well saying its normal here, rise above it. But that's not normal anywhere and I'll never be able to handle it. I do really love Brazil though... Thanks for the support!

(also I feel your pain! 5'10 blonde here. Catcalls kind of leveled off once my stare got muderous.)

To clarify, I just walked around with this expression. I didn't put it on once guys started catcalling me. As soon as I left my house, I tried to look as mean and unfriendly as possible at all times.

How about using Reddit to crowd organize an effort by men in Rio to try to present harassing women on the streets of Rio as being a symptom of a weak libido?

Have cool Brazilian guys spread the message that guys who catcall can't get it up. How about using Reddit to crowd organize an effort by men in Rio to try to present harassing women on the streets of Rio as being a symptom of a weak libido?

Have cool Brazilian guys spread the message that guys who catcall can't get it up. Oooh, I'd donate a few bucks to this campaign to help pay for fliers.  

Who has a catchy way to say cat callers are impotent in Spanish?   Oooh, I'd donate a few bucks to this campaign to help pay for fliers.  

Who has a catchy way to say cat callers are impotent in Spanish?     Just because many people agree that being a disrespectful misogynist is "part of the South American culture" does not make it alright, and it most certainly does NOT make it a good cultural value.   

Culture is not by definition good or bad, it's an established mode of behavior that connects people though virtue of having specific values in common.  

Is it charming that in Japan, unmarried women older than 25 are called "Christmas Cake", because no one ever wants it after the 25th?   Should it be accepted that under some tenets of Sharia law, honor killings are culturally appropriate?   Should we enjoy the cultural experience of Russian pedestrians throwing themselves in front of your car to coerce money?  

All of those examples are cultural but like the South American disrespect for women in public, they could stand to be improved.  

And it is not Eurocentric to say so, since many changes have been made and remain to be made on the front of social justice in Europe and North America.    I have a novel idea from my personal experience. Ace bandage the breasts, buy some men's clothes, get a short haircut, little mascara on the upper lip and the world's your oyster. Try it; you will be astonished at the freedom and privilege you enjoy. Is this for real? Even if you're joking it sounds hilarious, might have to try it. Not cutting the hair though, maybe a hat? It happened to me more or less by accident when I was 21 and it was absolutely fantastic. The odd part is that (although a pretty masculine person) I am only 5'3". Not only do men completely leave you alone, but salespeople etc. are much nicer and more helpful. It only becomes difficult when you need to use the public restroom.

After about 3 months of this I freaked out and bought a skirt, so I then had the extremely not-delightful experience of walking around Paris as a single woman. Night and day. I swear. Try it, if only for science.   </snippet></document><document><title>Update to "Can some of you tell me if this marriage proposal idea is brutal or not?"</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qzk0/update_to_can_some_of_you_tell_me_if_this/</url><snippet>So some people asked for an update to [this post:](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14nxl2/can_some_of_you_tell_me_if_this_marriage_proposal/)

The TLDR is I didn't ask on graduation day (from uni) like I was considering. I asked February 15th. She said yes, we're very happy.

The longer version: A lot of people said that the day would be "my day" more than our day. I didn't really agree with that but understood the sentiment so I went with your suggestions and decided not to do it on graduation. 

Valentines day we went to a play with a friend, not as a date but it was the only night the three of us could all go. So the 15th we did what we planned on doing for valentines day: Build a pillow/blanket fort and watch really shitty romantic comedies. 

So I asked her between two movies. She was happy and said yes. 

Anyway, the next day everyone we told was so happy, and I think this was the part I kind of overlooked. Friends and family all wanted to celebrate and celebrate we did. This would have been soo different and so much worse had I done it on graduation day. We would have been busy trying to celebrate my thing and our thing together and it would have been ... not good enough. 

So yeah ... I'm engaged. I didn't fully understand the arguments against that you guys made, but gave you the benefit of the doubt and definitely happy I changed the date. 

Thanks all! Take care 

  Congratulations! I'm glad you found the right time for you and for her. Thanks for sending us an update. Now, where's my invitation? j/k :) ^ Is not kidding, and many Redditors are now crazy for wedding invites or pics. &amp;lt;removed&amp;gt; &amp;lt;removed&amp;gt; Where is http://i.imgur.com/CN0x7Ge.jpg taken at? That view is incredible.      Congratulations, I hope we get a wedding update as well :) Best wishes and a happy life to both of you!     That is awesome! Did you plan on doing it on the 15th or did it just feel right?   Pillow fort proposal is just adorable. You sound like such a cute couple. 

I think the fact that you put so much effort into it, making sure that it was right by asking around first shows that you really care. It sounds like you're a great guy and she's lucky to have you. I hope you both have a wonderful future together. </snippet></document><document><title>Delayed birth control side effects?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18tukj/delayed_birth_control_side_effects/</url><snippet>Hi there! So, I'm 21 and have been using birth control almost since I was almost 17 with about a 7 month break in there somewhere. Just about every time I go in for a new prescription, they have me try something new. This is usually trying to fix something like low sex drive or something so it doesn't seem too weird. But because of that, I've only been on my current one for about a year. However, my last two or three periods I've gotten EXTREMELY emotional and mood swingy. This is so against my normal character it is ridiculous. 

So my question is, is it possible that it's my birth control, even though I've been on it for almost a year without similar effects?  Yes, it's absolutely possible. I had a similar experience caused by mine where I developed an estrogen intolerance out of the blue. You should speak with you GP or GYNO and look at other birth control options together. </snippet></document><document><title>Stalker "ex" has pictures of me without my consent and is sending them to new people in my life. Help?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18swox/stalker_ex_has_pictures_of_me_without_my_consent/</url><snippet>So the basic story is this 'stalker' and I are not in a relationship, though he felt entitled to my affection and raged when I expressed this. He's taken photos of me without my consent (although I was on video call at the time) and has old photos of me that aren't nude, but are me dressed up/down. Once another man showed interest in me on his own page/channel, the 'stalker' got enraged and sent all of these to the interested party and misrepresented me into looking like, as both of them now agree, a 'whore' - even though I was single, these photos were taken without my consent OR were of me when I was young and naive.

I'm devastated. I tried to reason with him to delete the photos, but my relationship with the recipient has already been destroyed. I need to make sure this won't happen again. Are there any resources for helping me deal with this issue? I'm in Canada, and this man is in the States, which is why I have no clue what to do. I'm too sick to my stomach to confront him without support. I feel like such an idiot for getting involved with someone this manipulative and emotionally abusive. Any advice, or thoughts would help, TwoX...  I don't know of the legality of those photos or what you can do to protect yourself from harassment. In my point of view, the answer lies between all the "it's public, people can bully you as they please that's what you get for looking like a woman outside your house," and "he should go to jail harassment is against the law." Obviously neither extreme will suit.

But as for the new relationship... Any guy who would call you a whore is worthless. Absolutely worthless. 

Good thing you found it out sooner rather than later. Take notes and make copies of all his harassing behaviors, even if they aren't in writing. &amp;gt;But as for the new relationship... Any guy who would call you a whore is worthless. Absolutely worthless.

&amp;gt;Good thing you found it out sooner rather than later.

Yeah, I'd say you dodged a bullet on that one.

Besides that, how the hell is he finding out who is interested in you or vice versa? The second person runs a fairly well-visited Youtube channel, under the same name as his Twitter and Facebook. The stalker put the pieces together, because even though I had him blocked and deleted, he made a new account and accessed the second person's details through friends-of-friends. He's REALLY messed up. I don't know of the legality of those photos or what you can do to protect yourself from harassment. In my point of view, the answer lies between all the "it's public, people can bully you as they please that's what you get for looking like a woman outside your house," and "he should go to jail harassment is against the law." Obviously neither extreme will suit.

But as for the new relationship... Any guy who would call you a whore is worthless. Absolutely worthless. 

Good thing you found it out sooner rather than later. Take notes and make copies of all his harassing behaviors, even if they aren't in writing.  Now this is from Wikipedia, so take it with a grain of salt.

"Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual...It may include the making of false accusations or statements of fact (as in defamation), monitoring, making threats, identity theft, damage to data or equipment, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information that may be used to harass. The definition of "harassment" must meet the criterion that a reasonable person, in possession of the same information, would regard it as sufficient to cause another reasonable person distress....Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail."

So basically, this is clearly causing you distress, and he is using your photos to make false claims about you to others. His possession of the photos may or may not be legal, I don't know. But the fact that he is sending those pictures to other people without your consent *after* you have asked him to stop is illegal, especially considering he is doing it with malicious intent. 

If it were me (and this is entirely my opinion), I would call the local police in his area and report that he is harassing you. It may not come to anything, but hopefully they will at least let him know that he's in danger of committing a criminal offense. He most definitely did if the photos he has of you were taken when you were underage.

The fact is, what he's doing *is* illegal. It wasn't...until he started distributing the photos with malicious intent without your consent. He is causing you distress and slandering your name to others. Keep a record of everything he says/does, including where he posts the photos if you know, and send it along to his local police department.    You actually can't do very much. Any photos from the internet are considered public property, anyone can even take a photo of you on the street, take your photo, and keep it and send it around. It isn't against the law. The best thing you can do is ask webpages that are posting it to take them down. If he begins to threaten you or anything you can call the tell the police. Just keep everything he says and does documented incase things get worse.  The online-taken ones are deleted and removed already, yeah. It's the ones he took of me that weren't public domain that bug me. Thank you, I'll try my best. I believe Phosphate-3 is completely wrong.  You can report him to the local police in his area for harassment, because that's what this is.  Not much can come from it at this point, but it creates a record so that if he tries it again or does worse (follows you, takes more pictures, sends you threatening messages, etc.) you can show that he has a history of stalking you.  Cover your bases.  Think of creating a record as an insurance policy.

How "young and naive" were you in the "dressed down" photos?  If you were underage, that is distribution of child pornography and his ass is grass.

As for the other guy that believed him and accepted all these photos, forget him.  You don't want to waste your time on someone who believes some immature stranger on the internet over you and calls women whores.  You dodged a bullet. Good to know I have options. And yeah, I really did dodge a bullet with the second guy. Thank you.</snippet></document><document><title>Diaper rash... From pads. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18s1dk/diaper_rash_from_pads/</url><snippet>I got a diaper rash from wearing pads. I haven't worn them in years, just panty liners. Anyone else ever have this happen? I'm so embarrassed.   Perhaps you might trying wearing the all cotton ones. Any weirdly super absorbent plastic covering and I get terribly irritated. Perhaps you might trying wearing the all cotton ones. Any weirdly super absorbent plastic covering and I get terribly irritated.  I'm pretty susceptible to "diaper rash". I had a problem while life guarding and sitting in a wet suit periodically through out the day and most recently I have a pair of jeans that I can't wear if I'm running around too much or it's too hot. I found it more annoying than embarrassing though- sensitive skin's a bitch :P

Are you sure it's not a rash from a sensitivity to the pad material?   I have sensitive skin and can't do plastic pads.  Highly recommend [cloth pads](http://www.partypantspads.com) for this.  (I dis-recommend their instructions to just throw them in the washer without presoaking, though.  It never works for me.)  

Site seems to be down at the moment but if you get on their list you can get a free liner and various coupons.  Desitin works wonders. Works on razor burn too.        Aaa and this is why I use tampons. I HATE pads Some of us have to use both :( I can't use tampons at all. I have a wonky shaped vagina. :| This is possible? I have to use both or just pads because no matter whar brand I use or what size, my tampons always leak! Is it the shape of my vag?? Have you tried applicatorless tampons?

I have no self confidence, no motivation, no nothing. I don't know what to do.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18sj8l/i_was_bullied_as_a_kid_and_its_completely_ruined/</url><snippet>I was a...victim, I guess, of bullying and I sort of still am, but it's never personal now, and it's fucked me over in so many different ways I don't even know who I used to be. 

When I was in primary school (UK, sort of similar to elementary or middle school I suppose?) everything was fine aside from the altercation or two with other kids. The school I went to was one of the 'good' ones, but the next school up - literally next door, there wasn't even 50 metres between the two schools - was not. They got their students from pretty much the entirety of our area, and a few others that were much worse areas than the one I lived in. Some of them were okay, some are still friends that I talk to today, but going from this nice school to one with all of these other kids in it that I didn't know was tough on its own. It was even worse when the bullying started.

I guess I was an easier target than most. I wasn't anything special, I didn't wear make up, I was *incredibly* naive (I didn't even know what 'grassing on' somebody meant, which is a commonly used term for snitching where I live) and so I was pretty much singled out by all of the friends I had made in my old school for the new, cooler people here. I did eventually get a friend group, but it wasn't the type that stick up for you for whatever, it was the type that would roll their eyes and half-heartedly comfort you. The bullying was the worst, and half of it wasn't even physical. Just constant mental torment, they'd all stare at me and laugh, then they'd make a point of being fake-nice to me, like...touching something horrible then touching my hair and saying it looked really nice today and I wouldn't notice until I got to a mirror later, telling me some boy had a crush on me - and it seems really petty now, but it wore me down and wore me down until I snapped and I slapped one of them. They didn't get in trouble, I did.

It didn't stop over the years, it just got worse, especially when the lads joined in. I got pushed down the stairs at one point and nothing more than a slap on the wrist happened. I think at one point they got suspended for hitting me, but only because we provided proof with pictures of my split lip and stuff from it. Just...because of everything they did over the years i'm so fucked up now, I have NO self confidence, I'm fat (i really am, verging on dangerously obese) with no desire to change myself, no motivation, depression, anxiety and doctors who don't seem to give a fuck. I go to a therapist but she doesn't really *help* and there's honestly no other options for me around here, college therapy only wants to focus on why I'm not doing work and why I'm not coming in and all of the other therapists in my area are for children only. I can't afford to travel for it and I'm just sick of feeling shit, I'm sick of being so fucking alone and nobody caring about me and sorry I'm ranting again. It's just got worse now that I'm in college, but in a different way - instead of being directly berated and hated on, it's now just...really subtle and I take everything said to me badly, the males in my class are *incredibly* misogynistic and everything I say deserves a 'back in the kitchen' style retort and if I respond to it, I just look pathetic. I can't assert myself, I can't do anything right and I don't have anything going for me. I'm not suicidal so don't worry about that, I'm just....at a loss. I don't know what to do.

Sorry, this was a lot longer than I expected it to be by FAR.  You are not alone. A lot of us were also bullied. I definitely was. 

Try group therapy - it will get you in a good setting with people who will understand you, PLUS lets you get interaction with others. 

I also find keeping journals really therapeutic. I also write unsendable letters where I can just let my rage flow. 

Do anything - point is to not let your bullies get to you. DO NOT LET THEM WIN. Success is the best revenge. 

You got this.  I'll look into group therapy, I dunno where to go about finding it but it might be possible? I know there's a church nearby that does stuff like that.  I don't know if this will be much help, but here's something I always tell myself when I feel like everyone around me is judging me:

How self-absorbed is that? To think that I'm the main focus of all of these different people? They've all got their own problems and things to worry about, they are probably not thinking about me and are instead staring into space that I happen to occupy with something completely unrelated on their minds.

Depression and anxiety are tough, and are not conditions that anyone can be expected to "get over" on their own. Do you have the option of finding new doctors? No doctor of mental health should ever make you feel like they don't care. If you aren't medicated for either depression or anxiety, that may be something you should look into.

--Hugs-- I wish I had something better to tell you. Good luck.  Can I just say it really takes some balls to own up and admit that you were bullied that badly? I think it's "normal" in a way to say "oh yeah, I was bullied" but talking in specifics...that's some intense stuff right there and I think you're really strong for not just talking about it but for dealing with it.

I'd just like to say this, though: if you continue to see yourself in this terrible light, if you continue to have no motivation whatsoever, whether it's for improving yourself or doing well in school or whatever, if you continue to just feel so horrible and shitty about yourself, then you've let them win. They hold all this power over you. And they shouldn't. You should be the only one to make yourself feel anything, whether it's "good" feelings (happiness, liking who you are, etc) or "bad" (feeling sad, angry, frustrated).

Do you want to continue letting them have that much power over you? It's your life, and you should be the only one deciding how happy you are with it.

If your current therapist isn't helping, surely your college/uni has other therapists who you can see. I know the psych place at my university will change your therapist at the drop of a hat if you're not liking your current one. And yeah, the ones around you might be "children only" but it really never hurts to call them up and ask if they'd take on an older patient.

The only thing I've really got left to say is that I believe in you. I believe you're better than those assholes have tricked you into thinking you are, I believe you can find some way to improve your self-esteem, and I believe that you're an amazing person and you are hella strong because of the bullying you went through. Please don't let them win. You absolutely can do this.  &amp;gt;I go to a therapist but she doesn't really help and there's honestly no other options for me around here, college therapy only wants to focus on why I'm not doing work and why I'm not coming in

I don't know you, but it seems that at least part of the reason you're probably not doing work or going to class is because you're miserable because you have been bullied and belittled in the past and are seeing misogyny in your current environment. Can you bring that up with your counselor or other counselors who work with her?

As for the, "I'm fat and have no motivation," you seem to recognize that your weight is "bad" for you (I really have no idea about your current physiological health), so it seems you have some motivation to start to change, just not enough to get to all the way to a healthier point. Are there weight-loss counselors outside of psychologists there? (I'm pretty unfamiliar since I'm in the US and they have next to no public providers for either area).

If none of that is an option, could you possibly stay with family or friends and work on stabilizing yourself psychologically before returning to school? &amp;gt;I go to a therapist but she doesn't really help and there's honestly no other options for me around here, college therapy only wants to focus on why I'm not doing work and why I'm not coming in

If none of that is an option, could you possibly stay with family or friends and work on stabilizing yourself psychologically before returning to school? Thank you for the response. The thing with college is the school system is different, our version of college is more like high school - I probably should have mentioned this. I'm living with my parents now until I go to university, which is pretty much my only option in life because I don't know what else I can do with my life. 

Most things cost money that I don't have available to me and seeing as I'll probably need a student loan if I get into uni, I can't risk trying for another. Ah, I forgot that "college" is high school in the UK. Is there more than one counselor at your school? Could you talk to another one?

How are you affording therapy with the other doctor now? Is there a way to get her to refer you to another therapist in the area (assuming there is another one), or for your parents to take you to a different therapist? Not every therapist/counselor meshes well with every single patient--maybe you would do better with someone else if this current person isn't helping much.  Unfortunately our system sucks (NHS and Public Schooling System). I can't offer a real long term solution. Although, when I feel down I text some one newish (friend of a friend, etc) or get in contact with some one from secondary school/college. Helps to have a new conversation, and the attention is nice. I think the NHS is pretty good as far as normal issues go for me, but the therapy is less than stellar. I have online friends I can talk to, I just wish there was somebody I could see face to face. I don't really have any other friends and I do go to archery, but everybody there is much older (much much older) and I'm like, the oldest of the 'younger' people too (under 14s usually).

Explanation included.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18s9ai/looking_for_unique_beautiful_photos_of_foreign/</url><snippet>Hi TwoX.  Not sure where to post a request like this?  I apologize if this is too off topic and will gladly remove.

I have a very dear friend who is dying from bladder cancer.  She is home in hospice care.  Her days are very, very limited and is only awake now for 5-10 minutes every few hours.  She can't speak.  She can hear and she can see.  Her father is with her playing his guitar, her two children and her husband are by her side. She is 35 years old and I am just so... so... sad.  And angry.  And so many things.  Helpless.  I'm feeling powerless and helpless.

My friend, Tanya, was a herbalist and avid gardener.  Her love of nature and butterflies was something she shared often.  Her friends are posting photos on her fb page of all the places they love, places she will never see herself.  I am looking for some unique, beautiful photos to share with her.  Her husband is showing these to her when she wakes up and it seems to bring her a lot of joy.

I would post her website as a link for proof or verification, but to be honest it has a donation thing and I don't feel comfortable with sharing that.  This is not about that, I'm just looking for something different that a Google search may not find.  

Thank you TwoX.

**Edited to add:**  Thanks to each of you.  These images are gorgeous and she will love them.  I'm putting together a little slideshow to email her husband.  

My friend lives on a little cove that is off of a lake.  Across from her, her neighbors have taken to nightly candle lighting.  The entire shore outside her bedroom window is lit up with hundreds of candles.  Her friends have taken to coming out each night to help light the mason jars housing votive candles.  I'm told she wakes up each night to see it.  For something so hard and so sad, knowing she can see how much she is loved is pretty awesome.  If you haven't checked out /r/EarthPorn, it's full of beautiful, high-res pics. There's also /r/AmateurEarthPorn and I personally like /r/VillagePorn, where you can see glimpses of civilization next to such beauty.  Are you on pinterest? I bet you could find a bunch of collections on there - maybe search for 'dream vacation' boards or something?

I wanted to share the anonymous message I got informing me about it, and talk about privacy, exploitation, and the shaming of female sexuality.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qetg/my_private_photobucket_albums_were_ripped_and/</url><snippet>(^(Background information is at the end.))

I am hardly upset about strangers seeing me nude. What I wanted to share are the deeper implications and what really bothered me about this situation:

1. The hackers for and viewers of this site expect me to be ashamed, because society would find such a thing a shame on me, and they relish the fact. As Anonymous pointed out to me (I've posted the conversation in the comments.), this could hurt me in pursuing a career. Why should it hurt my career that someone did something shitty to me? My body is not obscene. It is not shameful. And it most definitely should not be a source of outrage for anyone else. These situations are a shame on the people who seek out ways to exploit women and use their bodies against them. They are not a shame on the women who have the gall not to be veiled in their private moments.

2. Images of naked women who actually want those images public are abundant, free, and in much higher quality than the crappy camera phone pictures lifted from my albums. People like this delight in divorcing a woman from her agency. It is the non-consent precisely that makes the site I was posted to so successful. It is the blatancy of this kind of love of rendering women powerless that makes the denial that rape culture and sexism exist so frustrating.

3. The hypocrisy of those in our generation who are outraged by things like SOPA, the Patriot Act, or any minor breach of privacy, but delight in and defend things like creep shot forums and exposing women.

I did not push the issue, but it really bothered me that the person who came to me chose to do so anonymously, when I did not have the luxury of privacy. Then he made several attempts to hit on me behind that anonymity. That unfairness was clearly lost on him, and he seemed very comfortable in the face of what he perceived as vulnerability from me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few general pleas and reminders to anyone reading this:

1. Please remember to respect the privacy and dignity of all people.

2. Please try to recognize when you objectify a person and find yourself wanting to downplay the fact that they are humans living human lives.

3. When viewing porn, please be aware of what you are supporting when you give a website your page views and help them generate money. Please do not support people who make a living off of other people's bodies without their consent. Please never help a website deny a person her autonomy.

4. Please be conscious, and be kind.

**Background:**

I had a private Photobucket album that was just a personal archive for myself. It had pictures of myself wearing outfits I like so I could look back on uninspired days, like a virtual closet kind of. It had pictures I kept for weight-loss/fitness comparison, mirror shots of me in bathing suits or nude. It had some pictures I had uploaded from friends' computers when it was easier than having that person send them all to me. It had some pictures of my drawings and me making goofy faces. It was almost like a private photo diary.

It seemed safer than just keeping them in a folder on my computer, as a backup in case it crashed, and being password protected there since I let other people use my computer sometimes. That was obviously wrong thinking.

I didn't use it very often and almost never linked images from it anywhere, just because there wasn't anything there I really cared about sharing with others.

At the beginning of this week I got an anonymous message on Facebook, which I'll post in comments with the full conversation, from someone claiming to be from my university and to have stumbled across the porn site with hundreds of my pictures, of which maybe a dozen were nude.

**tl;dr:** Anonymous person sends me a Facebook message this week that includes a link to a porn site with hundreds of clothed and nude photos of me.</snippet></document><document><title>Ladies, listen to your body.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qx29/ladies_listen_to_your_body/</url><snippet>I'm posting in part out of boredom since I have been up all night and just need to get it all out. Tonight I almost died. I had a seizure at 8 pm last night after a weekend of shortness of breath I thought was associated with bronchitis. As it turns out, it was pulmonary embolism most likely associated with my birth control as I have no other risk factors. Go out there and have a great day. You never know when it all could end. Sorry for rambling.  Will you tell us a little more about your experience?  Can you describe your symptoms?  Reddit isn't a place for medical advice, but I think a lot of us on hormonal birth control would love to hear what "risk of blood clots" can look like in the real world.  Thank you! Sure. Several weeks ago I was diagnosed by ecare with acute bronchitis. This includes shortness of breath, coughing and the like. I was given cough syrup, a nebulizer, an inhaler and a z pack. 

About two weeks later, I was waking up in the mornings with slight leg cramps. I chalked it up to sleeping funny. Two days ago I started to have slight breathing troubles again. Yesterday, I was feeling short of breath while shopping, so I took a hit of inhaler. Several hours after getting home, I was panting at my desk. I stretched and felt a bit dizzy and light headed, so I tried to reach my nebulizer. I felt so sick I couldn't work it and laid down on the couch. Then apparently I made a strange noise, seized with pupils dilated and woke up very confused. My husband called 911 and I took an ambulance ride where I seized again.

At the hospital, I was gasping for breath, and seized again. I vomited all over myself while receiving O2. My back was in so much pain, I was incoherent and turning blue even with oxygen. I had a CAT scan and x rays where they identified several clots in my left leg and several in both lungs. I was put on clot busters. Apparently the mortality rate for my condition is 30 %. Y doctors even said they thought they were going to lose me at several points. It was extremely sudden and aggressive. If my husband had tried to drive me to the hospital, I would be dead.

As of today, I'm on O2 still, but looking good. I may be able to go home in a couple of days. I'm on bed rest. I will be out if work one or two weeks and on blood thinners for 6 months. I have been a bit of a roller coaster today. Split between crying and euphoria that I'm alive.

Hope that helps. Holy crap, this is the kind of stuff that scares me about my birth control. I'm so glad you are okay!

Can I ask how long have you been on birth control? 7 years. Since I was 18. Sure. Several weeks ago I was diagnosed by ecare with acute bronchitis. This includes shortness of breath, coughing and the like. I was given cough syrup, a nebulizer, an inhaler and a z pack.

Hope that helps. Ok, I am seriously hyperventilating right now because what if this happens to me. I don't have a husband to take me to the hospital or anyone to notice I'm dying. How do I know the difference between normal leg cramps and blood clots? I actually worry about that a lot, because my legs cramp. Last spring I started having some trouble breathing for a little while and they gave me an inhaler saying it was probably allergies. I started hormonal birth control 7 years ago. Omg, you can die so easily. Is anyone reading this? Someone please talk me down, I'm freaking out. Ok, I am seriously hyperventilating right now because what if this happens to me.

Per [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clot-legs), symptoms include swelling, gradual onset, redness/warm to the touch (like a sunburn), worsening pain when bending the foot, and leg cramps.  Wow! How scary! So glad you're ok.Make sure you get the panel of blood work to rule out underlying blood clotting disorders. If you're under 35, healthy bmi, and don't smoke, I would say it's very likely you have some condition you don't know about yet. I had a DVT (blood clot in leg that didn't break off and go to my lung thank god), and I had no risk factor besides being on nuvaring. Turns out, I have MTHFR homozygous. 

I'm sure your dr will be running the tests, but verify!! I strongly suspect you will no longer be prescribed hormonal birth control! Also, pregnancy will be a higher risk if you do have an underlying condition, so it's really important to know now rather than later.

I'm an RN that manages my clinic's Patients on Coumadin, so I see these kinds of cases daily. It's so very rare to have a PE and not have an underlying condition. 

Also, stay on top of your INR! Follow the diet as never miss your Coumadin dose! Your PE slowly dissolves and can reform quickly of your blood doesn't stay thinned out enough. It sucks, I know, but it's sooooo important! I see people who are bad with their Coumadin, and their PE never gets better!! So frustrating!!!

Feel enter soon!!!! So glad you made it! Thank for the advice. I think they took half my blood last night and some this morning. I don't mess with doctors orders, so I will be following them to a tee. My doctor already said no more birth control, and I'm ok with that. My husband and I are now looking into a vasectomy.

Feel enter soon!!!! So glad you made it! Ah this terrifies me as I'm on the Nuvaring. Emboli are one of my greatest health related fears. Check your package insert, but I believe the risk of emboli is lower with the Nuvaring because its horemones aren't systemic in the same way that the pill or the patch is.

Feel enter soon!!!! So glad you made it!  I had this happen as well.  I ended up, at 24 years old in the ICU with a DVT and a PE.  I was tired and short of breath and feeling like shit for several weeks.  I thought it was the flu or something.  I finally went to my doctor's office where I saw a Physicians Assistant.  She looked at me, listened to my lungs and ran to get the doctor.  They had my walk around the hall and my lips were blue and my blood oxygen was about 76.  They sent me to the big hospital down the street(my friends had driven me to the appt) and in the ER after tests the Dr said it was a PE.  I knew it could be fatal and I just cried while gasping for air from the oxygen mask.  Always listen to your body, always.  

edit:  It was attributed to my BC and I was involved in a lawsuit.   Yeah, I'm only 25. My O2 bottomed at 78. It was miserable and painful. Yeah, I'm only 25. My O2 bottomed at 78.

I was just wondering, how long did you wind up being on blood thinners?   I'm so sorry that happened to you, and it's wonderful to hear you made it through. I'm on hormonal birth control because it curbs my horrid, horrid cramps and mood swings. I really hope I don't ever suffer life threatening consequences from being on birth control...I couldn't face going off it... Yeah, that's one lame consequence of all of this. But it's bc or my life. :-\ God, I really hope your cramps off birth control aren't as bad as mine are. Best of luck to you! Mine used to be bad. Periods used to be 8 days and cramps had me curled up on the couch feeling sick. I hope it doesn't go back.  That is scary to read, I'm glad you are okay.

I've been on hormonal birth control (says they are levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets...) for about 9 months now and I was terrified to start taking them. Reading things like this really make me worry sometimes.

I'm a non smoker and of average weight, but I do think about possible side effects sometimes. Right now I have nausea and vomiting the first few days whenever I start a new package and sometimes my emotions can flip flop easily when they hadn't before. I also lately get a lot of random discharge throughout the month (yeah, gross)...

It helps though with the horrible cramps I used to get sometimes. I haven't had to take any pain pills at all when I used to have to for the cramps.

I'd just be afraid to switch brands to find a completely symptomless kind for me because I worry about suffering from something more serious so I'm just dealing with the nausea/vomiting and my sometimes crazy emotions. I was on a pill (can't remember which unfortunately), that gave me crazy mood swings- like perfectly fine to wanting to bawl my eyes out, and I'm not a cryer). I called my doctor, and she switched me to a generic for lo-ovral, and i haven't had problems with it.


Basically, if you feel like a crazy person, it's worth trying to find a new one imho.

Wow! glad you're ok. I did hear that birth control can contribute to clots especially if you smoke.    [deleted] Tri Sprintec. It's a generic variant of Ortho Tricyclen. I fucking hate Tri Sprintec.  I was on it for a while because I couldn't afford Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and there wasn't an OTC-lo generic.  It messed with my body way more than OTC-lo.  I ended up getting migraines with aura while on it, freaked out, told my NP, and she was like, OTC-lo or no horemonal BC for you.  (Granted, she was a bitch, but at least I got back on OTC-lo.) Oh man. I'm on Tri Sprintec. I can only cross my fingers and hope I fare better on it than apparently everyone in this thread has... Hope your symptoms have gone away, and you're doing better on OTCLo :) Oh man. I'm on Tri Sprintec.

What's the difference between Tri sprintec and sprintec. I'm only 18 but I'm on sprintec and previously on orthocyclen and never had any troubles with it.  Sprintec and Ortho-cyclen have uniform horemone levels throughout the month, while Tri-Sprintec, OTC, and OTC-lo have variable levels throughout the month. Is one safer than the other?

Out of curiosity, have you considered other brands (and their generic counterparts) to OTC-lo? I was on OTC-lo when I was 15 (9 years ago now) and I would get the same migraines and other various symptoms. These days I'm on Lutera, after spending about 9 months on Aviane (Lutera's generic; the only reason I "switched" to Lutera was because my pharmacy ran out of Aviane, and my Rx called for either based on what was in stock). It does the job well and I've never had a single side effect, outside of user-error (attempted to switch what time of day I took the pill and ended up getting some very, very light PMS-mood swings and some spotting after 7months of no period or PMS.).


OP -- I am SO glad you are alright! I also can't thank you enough for sharing your story. All the hugs in the world and best wishes for you! Nope, OTC-lo works like a charm for me.  The higher horemone dose and possibly something else (more variability in dosage because generic, but still within drug guidelines?) with Tri-Sprintec was no good. Tri Sprintec. It's a generic variant of Ortho Tricyclen.      I would love to listen to my body, but unless i'm dying I can't afford to go to the doctor.  And even then I can't i just probably should.  

For instance, I haven't had a period since last august.  Nothing I can do about it.  There is never nothing you can do about it! Seems like you're very fatalistic! 

Maybe you're in the US (or elsewhere) and I don't particularly know about that healthcare system, but everybody should have access to healthcare. Surely there is some option for you...? Why is it that you can't afford it? 

Your lack of period is pretty serious. That is the sort of thing you should have checked out. 

Also, is there anybody out there that can help?  I'm in the US.  I don't qualify for the free medicaid here because apparently it's only reserved for people who have babies.  I'm an unemployed college student with health conditions, you'd think that would be up there in people deserving of healthcare but no.

I can't afford it because I have no job.  With graduation coming in May i will soon have to start repaying student loans and can't afford to have even more healthcare debt than I already do. (I had two ER visits without insurance so I have roughly 2500$ of debt i'm paying off 25$ at a time)

I can go to the ER any time, but I can't make an appointment for this to get checked out.  Lets just say I dream of the day I can move to Canada.  And no, there is no one that can help out.  My mother's husband already had to file bankruptcy due to medical costs.  
 go to the PA at your school. Yeah, they can suck, but they can also give you information on resources around you that are cheaper. For example, there is a place here in NY that has doctors volunteer their services for people who cannot afford insurance and are stuck in the bubble like we are (i have a job, so i cant qualify for medicaid, but i barely make enough to live on). Seriously, it is better to try than to do nothing.  We don't have a PA.  It's just a small tech school.  I don't need cheaper, i need free.  And unfortunately that care seems to go to people with families.  I didn't even get any resources when I went in to the medicaid office on Friday to apply.  She basically asked me if I was pregnant, or if I had kids.  When I said no she told me I don't really qualify but that I might get birth control and a yearly physical if i'm approved.

I filled out the paperwork, but i'm not hopeful.  I also got papers on emergency food banks when I applied for SNAP benefits, but i'm not hopeful for that either.  She at least gave me resources.

 This seems so incredible that it could be the case. Surely there are free clinics and things over in the US, if only just for womens' problems.  

Sorry, I'm over on the other side of the world...and our system is very good (has its own problems, but whatever, it works on the whole) it's hard for me to understand how a first world country could let anybody fall through the gaps. My heart goes out to you!  Oh I know all about those other systems.  I think we experienced it most in Germany when my mother had amazing coverage due to her job.  She often laments not divorcing my father and keeping the rest of us there to grow up.  I do too the majority of the time.  

There are free clinics, but I have yet to see one in my area that appears open.  There's a building in our town that says it's a free clinic but i've never seen anyone parked in front of it.  I'm sure there's probably one an hour away in the city (barely a city) but I don't have the time with my schedule to make it there.  

I'd move back overseas in a heartbeat if someone offered it to me.  I generally dislike many of the practices in the US.  Germany seems to have a lot going for it, the more I read, the more I give it the thumbs up. 

Well come and live in Australia! Get a working visa happening (we still have lots of jobs for graduates, I'm fairly sure our unemployment rate for grads is lower than yours...) and as you're skilled it should be no problem. As a not entirely unrelated story, my sister is going to go live in Canada for a year and apparently that's a pretty easy visa for her to get too.  I would love to listen to my body, but unless i'm dying I can't afford to go to the doctor.  And even then I can't i just probably should.  

For instance, I haven't had a period since last august.  Nothing I can do about it.  If I may ask, are you using a hormonal contraceptive method at the moment?  Sometimes these cause a lack of menstrual bleeding.  Or it could  be due to stress or a change in diet. </snippet></document><document><title>Best friend's mother just "exiled" me from their house and made fun of me. What the f...?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18sacj/best_friends_mother_just_exiled_me_from_their/</url><snippet>So, a little backstory: I'm 18 and have been best friends with Bekah (19) for almost 5 years now. We do almost everything together and my family absolutely loves her and considers her to be a part of our family. She comes with us on family vacations, and used to spend almost the entire summer at our house. We still see each other frequently, despite the fact that she lives almost 45 minutes away.

Anyways, her mother, Laura, has been married three times. The first marriage was to Bekah's father, and ended when Bekah was very young (5 or 6 years old, I think), after her mother cheated on her father. The second marriage lasted a few years and ended when her husband had a heart attack and died. She started dating the next husband only a year or so later, and they were married after only a few months of dating, without telling Bekah or Bekah's older brother about it, which really upset them both.

According to Bekah and her brother, their mother wasn't always like this, and this kind of behavior started when she married Dave. She cut herself off from all of her friends and literally only spends her time with Dave, watching TV, making food for him, and taking long drives to Maine or South Carolina. Dave is morbidly obese and has a large amount of money he inherited from a late family member, and Bekah suspects her mother married him for this reason, which is terrible but may be true. :\

Over the course of the past year or so, Laura has been allowing me to come over to their house less and less, to the point where I'm not even allowed to wait there for my ride to pick me up. I had always thought Laura liked me, or at least tolerated me, as she was always pleasant to my face.

Today, Bekah called me up, on the verge of tears. Her mom had yelled at her for "not doing anything around the house" (despite the fact that Bekah pretty much takes care of the entire house, does the dishes, cleans the bathroom, maintains a 4.0 GPA, and has a job). Seriously, in my opinion (maybe I'm biased but still), her mom really doesn't do much anymore (compared to when I first met her four years ago), besides cooking really lavish meals for Dave and going to work at the library.

Now, every time Bekah asks her mother if I can go over her house, she comes up with a random excuse and says no. Now, I can understand that it's Laura's house and she should be able to say who can and cannot be at her house, but this just crossed the line...

She told Bekah, "Honestly, I just don't like her. She's weird. I don't think she's a good friend for you, and I don't want a weird person like that in our house." Bekah flipped and couldn't believe that this was the real reason Laura never let me come over...because I'm "a weird red-headed girl" (Laura's exactly words). She also insulted my family, which is a line she really should not have crossed.

And yes, my hair is a bright crimson color, it's been that way for almost three years now. I have a lip piercing and I'm "artsy", I guess, but I've always liked being unique and never have considered my sense of style to be a valid reason for someone to hate me so much. 

The thing is, Laura has known me for almost five years, she knows what kind of person I am. I've never done drugs, I've never smoked a cigarette in my life, I only drink occasionally and never to excess, I do well in school and have always been nothing but polite and courteous to Laura and Dave.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent about all this, it really bothered me. I'm saddened that someone could say something like that to their daughter about someone that she KNOWS is such an important part of her life.

I don't know, maybe I'm over-reacting or just being emotional, but I feel a bit sad for Laura. She really doesn't have any friends anymore, as she's isolated herself completely with her husband. I feel even worse for Bekah, who seems to have lost her mother.

Sigh. Anyone have advice or something? I'm sad :(  You're not over-reacting. Your emotions are well-founded. I'm sorry to hear about this mess. I'd say, if at all possible, see if you can have Bekah over more often. There's not really anything you can do for Laura at this point, but Bekah probably really needs her friend, so just be there for her and maybe Laura will come around in time to realize your worth to her daughter. That's about all I got though. :( Very sorry for your situation. Good luck  You're not over-reacting. Your emotions are well-founded. I'm sorry to hear about this mess. I'd say, if at all possible, see if you can have Bekah over more often.

That's about all I got though. :( Very sorry for your situation. Good luck  Thank you! It sucks because she gets pretty erratic hours at work since she's new there, scheduling time for us to hang out can be tricky.

Either way, thanks again, you guys made me feel better about this whole thing :)  &amp;gt; Anyone have advice or something? 

Yeah, some people just suck.  Be glad you had this experience when you were young before you ran into somebody who sucked like this that could actually affect your life.  Ha, you're so right. Thank you, that actually made me feel a lot better. I always thought I had met my fair share of sucky people, but this experience has really set a new standard for "sucky".  Are you and/or Bekah planning on moving out of home and/or going to college? I feel bad for her and can relate to her situation, but if you work hard, life can get better when you're out on your own and away from crazy family.

Maybe if you're moving out soon, Bekah can join you, depending on work/school factors. Yeah, I'm currently finishing up a homeschooling program (2 exams to go...woot!) and Bekah is enrolled in a few classes at her local college. We're definitely planning (hoping?) to move in together as soon as I'm officially graduated.

She absolutely cannot wait to move out, it's a pretty toxic environment for her there. A plausible theory: Laura is trying to break up your friendship so she won't loose her unpaid live in maid. 

Mad fairy tale theory: I'm getting a Hans and Gretel wibe what her fattening up hubby number 3 and treating your friend like crap. You sure that hubby number 2 died of natural causes? Yeah, I'm currently finishing up a homeschooling program (2 exams to go...woot!) and Bekah is enrolled in a few classes at her local college. We're definitely planning (hoping?) to move in together as soon as I'm officially graduated.

She absolutely cannot wait to move out, it's a pretty toxic environment for her there. It sounds like you two are good for each other. You're lucky to have a friend like her, and she's lucky to have you. The only unlucky part is her mom.     &amp;gt;Bekah (19)
&amp;gt; Bekah asks her mother if I can go over her house,

Why the fuck is a 19 year old asking for permission to go and visit a friend?   There's nothing you can do about crazy moms. If anything, you not going to Bekah's house anymore might be a good thing for Bekah. It could spare her the pain of having you see what a mess her family's become, and always having to hang out at your house means more time for her spent *out* of that place.


Your best bet is just to ignore Laura, and don't let her shit get to you, and to be there for Bekah. Nobody can solve Laura's problems for her, especially if she doesn't realize/won't admit what a problem she has. I hope Bekah can get out of that situation soon.</snippet></document><document><title>Colorado Democrat: Women Don&#8217;t Need Guns If They &#8216;Feel Like They&#8217;re Going To Be Raped'</title><url>http://www.redstate.com/dloesch/2013/02/18/colorado-democrat-women-dont-need-guns-if-they-feel-like-theyre-going-to-be-raped/</url><snippet>  I've considered getting a small handgun before, and I still may. If I decide to, I will go an do all the necessary training, practice at a range, and so on. Even then, I'm not even sure I would be able to conceal-carry it in my state, though. 

I think it's reasonable enough to say that we shouldn't just hand out a gun to every woman and say "this is in case you feel like you're going to get raped." 

&amp;gt;Salazar also doesn&#8217;t explain his insinuation that women [are] basically ditzes who are incapable of proper reasoning and capable of handling firearms.

I just feel like the Rep's wording was very unfortunate. Sure I can read into his quote as saying "wimin can't shoot so no guns 4 u guise" but come on...

I'm not exactly sure what the author of the article is trying to say here. She threw out one statistic and then pretty much just bashed this guy. It's adding yet another stance and angle to the already hugely hot-button issue of gun control...is that really necessary?    i agree, and really i can't believe that a right wing newspaper is mad about someone calling a woman dumb when the political right thinks that women are too dumb to control their own bodies. apparently it's bad to call us dumb when we want to shoot people but not when we're asking for reproductive rights.

It's adding yet another stance and angle to the already hugely hot-button issue of gun control...is that really necessary?    Kinda going off on a little bit of a tangent here, but from my personal perspective women who are first learning about gun safety and the fundamentals of shooting are usually much worse off than men. I'm not sure what it is, maybe men just have more exposure to guns growing up than women do, I have a few friends who think some of it has to do with first person shooter video games honing hand eye coordination but I really don't know about all that.

The good thing about women who want to learn is that most of them don't bring a lot of the bravado that men bring to the range and are better learners and improve much quicker than their male peers and catch up pretty quick. The anatomical differences between men and women seem to favor women in some respects, their wider hips provide a sort of "platform" to shoot off of when it comes to long guns, of course most women are behind males in upper body strength by quite a bit and I've seen quite a few struggle to keep a gun in the proper firing position. Well, you did say that it was from your personal perspective. I'm not sure how much exposure you have had to women operating firearms. I've been to a few ranges probably 5-6 times total back when I was close friends with someone who was a gun fanatic, and the very first time I went along and shot a gun with zero prior experience, he was super impressed and said that none of the male friends he's brought along as first-timers did nearly as well. The target didn't really lie either, and I was surprised myself at how good I was. 

That's just my anectodal experience, and I think I've always subconsciously bought into the stereotype that women are shittier at spatial coordination. There've been a lot of studies proving that just that awareness of the stereotype alone can impair women's performance on those tasks - a performance anxiety, if you will, that you'll confirm the stereotype. So I don't know, but I definitely can speculate about how women aren't really encouraged to do things that require spatial abilities as much as men, and there are probably some underlying physical/mental things that affect it to an extent.

But really, to me, in this context, it doesn't matter. It's a very short leap for most narrow-minded people to go from "women are worse shooters than men" to "women shouldn't own guns." Just like "women are weaker than men on average" leads many to "women shouldn't be allowed in combat."  I've been working part time at a range for a while now. Women generally start off completely clueless starting off but also pick it up pretty quick if they're interested. Men generally come in with some basic knowledge and are better shooters off the bat but are worse learners, even the motivated ones, and sometimes especially the motivated ones.

&amp;gt; "women are worse shooters than men" to "women shouldn't own guns." Just like "women are weaker than men on average" leads many to "women shouldn't be allowed in combat." 

Those two situations aren't really comparable, women can be just as good of marksmen as men. Women are physically limited in a multitude of ways, not just strength, that generally make them less desirable than males for that kind of job. That's true; I wasn't insinuating that the two scenarios were exactly analogous, rather the reasoning or rationale used to get from A-&amp;gt;B is quite similar a lot of the time. you said yourself that women have some "limitations" with things like strength in being able to support a heavy firearm, but other aspects of physicality that can actually serve to be advantages. I would argue that the same thing applies to combat roles. Unless I'm missing something other than the classically cited physical limitations such as overall size, upper body strength...and what else would there be? Being on their periods, or their boobs being distracting? Haha. I don't know.    </snippet></document><document><title>Advice on how to talk to my conservative parents about my sex life</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18svmx/advice_on_how_to_talk_to_my_conservative_parents/</url><snippet>Hi TwoX, long time lurker, first time commenter. I wasn't sure where to come to with this problem, but I know you ladies give some fantastic advice and my problem does have a hint of gender bias. (PS, if there are any out there, you gents gice great advice too!) 

Let me start off with the TL;DR before i throw a wall of text at you: I'm the 21 year old only daughter of conservative parents and have always had a very open, honest relationship with them. The only thing I've kept secret from them is my sex life, and I hate it. How do I talk to them about it?

If you've got an answer already, go ahead and skip straight to the comments. If not, let's get into some detail. 

My parents have preached the gospel of abstinence until marriage for my entire life. Growing up, I loved the idea of saving my sacred virginity for my husband, especially since my mother told me she was a virgin on her wedding night. Then at about age 12, I found porn and my clitoris and decided that I would have sex with someone special, husband or not, whenever I felt ready.

Fast forward 10 years and 5 sexual partners later to today. Not much has changed in my life. I'm unemployed, still in school, and at the mercy of my parents since I still live at home with them. I'm essentially a 21 year old child, complete with chores and a curfew. One of the highlights of my life is the great relationship I have with a man my parents absolutely love. For the sake of the story, let me call him D.

On some level, I know my mother knows that I'm having sex. I know it and D knows it. D has always had an incredibly open relationship with his parents and is just absolutely baffled by my situation. I could go to his mother about his sexual history if I needed to.

D and I have had our arguments about my strict parents, but overall he's been very understanding about the situation. I almost feel like he's more understanding than I am. We live about an hour away from Hollywood and I enjoy going out with D and our friends. But some nights need to be cut short, thanks to a curfew that isnt always strictly enforced. My curfew situation is sort of a "you call it" deal. I give my mother a time when I'll be home and if its unacceptable, she'll replace it with whatever time she wants. If she knows that we're going to some bar or club, she's understanding enough to give me a couple extra hours out compared to when we go to dinner. Needing to be home at a certain time is incredibly stressful in itself, especially factoring in time for traffic, sobering up, and afterglow. I'm off on a tangent about my curfew, but I think that information is pretty relevant to the situation.

As I've gotten older, I've realized that the idea of a virgin bride is romantic but incredibly impractical. I've also deduced that my mother wasn't as virginal on her wedding day as she says she was. I don't want to accuse my parents of anything, but my god, my father can barely go five minutes without getting a "honey I'm home" kiss from my mom. Also, this last new year's eve, while talking about my cousin's engagement, the topic of sex came up. We were in a lovely group of absolutely hammered family members, with my mother being one of the drunkest. My cousin very sarcastically made a comment about my mom being s virgin until marriage and my mother returned the sarcasm tenfold, saying "HEY, I absolutely was a virgin!" She then shot my cousin the absolute scariest look of "shut the fuck up my daughter is right here."

In another situation that involved a group of my family members and alcohol, I remember talking amongst some of my female family members about my 14 year old male cousin's brand new girlfriend. All of them, my mother included, agreed that his father needed to give him "the sex talk" to make sure he was being safe, since it was assumed that my cousin was having sex with her. At the time of this conversation, I was 18 and in a long term relationship that was going into its first full year, but I never got a sex talk when I started dating him. Hell, I never had any sort of sex talk. My sex talk was "don't have sex", end of discussion. I was and still am floored and even a little bit offended by this ridiculous double standard.

I'm in the process of writing my mother a letter telling her about it. The letter is going on six pages expanding on almost everything I've written about in this post. The letter started as a confessional for myself to get this weight off my shoulders. This lying business is terrible, especially since my mother and I have a fantastic relationship in every other area. I realized that the best way to completely clear my conscience is for me to give my mother the letter, but I'm terrified to do so. I'm terrified of her being upset or mad or disappointed, but I address this in the letter. I understand that she may feel this way, but I want her to appreciate the fact that I've made the decision to come clean about all this and finally be truly honest.

So what do you think TwoX? Should I give it to her, or should I approach this situation a different way? I'm open to any and all suggestions/testimonies/experiences. I'm actually very open to hearing about your own situations with conservative parents and the sex talk.

PS: I've written this on my phone, so please forgive any errors!  Conservative or not, I don't think parents need to know the details of their kids' sex lives.

There is a difference between "lying" (lie of omission, like in star trek 4), and maintaining your privacy. Your sex life is none of their business.  Conservative or not, I don't think parents need to know the details of their kids' sex lives.

There is a difference between "lying" (lie of omission, like in star trek 4), and maintaining your privacy. Your sex life is none of their business.  I do understand that it isn't their business, I'm beginning to think that the pressing issue is my relationship with my mother. It bugs me that I can go to her and talk about everything else but this.  I have a few thoughts on this whole deal...

Why do you feel like you need to tell her in the first place? I have a pretty good relationship with my parents but honestly your sex life (or lack thereof, if that were your choice) is not their business.

I'm also of the opinion that when you're living with your parents, you kind of have to play by their rules. Do they know? Probably. But it's better for them to have a sneaking suspicion than for you to tell them and remove all doubt. Then you risk the possibility of them kicking you out, charging you rent, cutting you off, etc. Same goes with the curfew thing. You're not a child, but you do have to treat their rules with respect since they don't have to help you out. It's been gnawing at me for a while, I just don't feel right sneaking around and keeping it from my mother. I don't think I could talk about this with my father under any circumstances, but keeping it from her is another story. I don't know, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I've been thinking, "Is this what I would want my daughter to do? No, I'd want her to feel comfortable enough to talk to me about it." 

I do agree with you about the playing by their rules issue. I'd like to think they wouldn't kick me out or cut me off because of it, but I really have no idea how they would react to it because I really have no baseline of how they'd punish me. I've always respected their rules and have never gotten out of line enough to warrant some sort of real discipline.

A little about me, Male, Long hair... over 10 inches... need to cut for my job...

The reason I came here is because you girls are probably going to know more then the rest of Reddit.

I will post a picture later of what we are working with... (if there is a better place for this kind of question, point me to them)  Yeah, I've heard the some negative things about Locks of Love (that they charge for some of their wigs.)  Try [Wigs 4 Kids](http://www.wigs4kids.org/) if you're interested in donating specifically for children- and it seems to be totally free for the kids and their families.  Caveat: the cut length must be at least 10 inches, and only kids in Michigan qualify.  Wigs 4 Kids is not to be confused with Wigs For Kids, which, though not limited to Michigan, is similar to Lock of Love in that they charge for some of the pieces.

Personally, I've donated a couple of times to [Pantene Beautiful Lengths](http://www.pantene.com/en-US/PanteneBeautifulLengths/Pages/default.aspx)- once in 7th grade and once at the end of high school.  Pantene isn't limited to children, and they're partnered with the American Cancer Society.  Also, their minimum is 8 inches, though they obviously accept longer lengths!

I've looked into both Locks of Love and Pantene Beautiful lengths and I definitely recommend Pantene. Locks of Love is very deceptive in its advertising. Their wigs are not free, they are sold on a sliding scale. Pantene charges nothing. Their wigs are truly free and go to anyone who needs them as they aren't limited to children. 

I think it's great that you're donating your hair. Have fun with your new hair cut! :)</snippet></document><document><title>Can you ladies share stories of when you were a bully/bullied in school?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18rwwo/can_you_ladies_share_stories_of_when_you_were_a/</url><snippet>I'm being subject to a lot of rumors and hate in school and I would like it if I could be related with because sometimes I feel really alone.

He is really cool and we are very compatible. We share a lot of the same interests and values. He makes me laugh, and his dick is pretty big, which is a definite plus.  We met on okcupid, which I've used to find my last two boyfriends (shit works, yo). I've been talking to a lot of guys and going on dates, but this particular guy is the only one I've been hanging out with on a regular basis.  

I am still friends with my most recent ex, and until last night, was friends with benefits with him.  Last night I stopped him from kissing me because I think things are going to move forward with this other dude and I'm starting to feel bad.  I had been having sex with both of them (and they were both aware of this).  I am using a throwaway because my ex knows my main account name.

I've been thinking about him a lot more lately and the last time we hung out, agreed that we really enjoy each others company and there might be a future in it.  He just got out of a 7 year relationship, and I'm in kind of a slutty phase right now (not really, just enjoying being single and talking to/going on dates with different types of dudes), so we are taking things slow and haven't made anything official.

I like him a lot, but I'm wondering if I'm just settling on him because I want to be in a relationship again.  I'm perfectly content being single, though. Its nice to not have to worry about someone else, to be able to make plans without taking anyone else into consideration.   But I'm afraid that a part of me just wants to be comfortable in a relationship again.  If I were to make him my boyfriend, I want to take things slow... keeping him to myself for a while before introducing him to my family and friends, who live two hours away.

I'm supposed to go out on a date with another guy from OKC soon, and was going to decide after that about the guy I'm interested in.  But that's the problem... am I dating him because I really do like him, or just because I don't like anyone else better yet and that's where the relationship is heading - coupledom?

Has anyone else been in this type of situation before? How do you know if you really like someone, as opposed to the idea of them?   </snippet></document><document><title>Just need some perspective.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18stm9/just_need_some_perspective/</url><snippet>Hey 2XC, just wanted to get your thoughts on something. (Probably TMI) 

A few weeks ago, I had my annual gyno exam done. A week later, they called to tell me that my pap results came back abnormal and that I would have to have a colposcopy done (for those of you unfamiliar, this is a procedure in which they examine your cervix with a microscope and usually take a biopsy from a few areas.) This isn't a huge deal to me, because I went through this whole sequence of events two years ago. The results of that one came back and they determined that I just had some abnormal tissue due to having HPV. It was decided that I'd just continue to have regular paps and the condition would be monitored. 

So in a few weeks, I have to go have this second biopsy done. Not a very pleasant procedure, but not particularly alarming for me, either. Until about a week ago.

I started having random, period-like cramps in my abdomen. Nothing severe, but irritating enough for me to pop a few Tylenol. They would come and go during the day. Then, this past weekend I had intercourse twice. The second time on Saturday night was fairly rough (though entirely consensual, don't worry!) Afterwards, I was a pretty sore down there, but I didn't really feel like it was abnormal. 

I woke up Sunday morning with a good amount of discomfort still and some slight bleeding. Still, I didn't think it was very out of the ordinary and just chalked it up to being a little rowdy. This morning however, I noticed significantly more blood coming out. Not enough to require a pantyliner as if I were on my period, but definitely enough to drip out when I pee. The blood is dark (not bright red like say, second day period blood) and has bits of tissue falling out as well. It has not gotten better throughout today, and actually seems to be a bit heavier. 

I was just going to write it off as some mild trauma from intercourse, but now I'm not so sure. I'm on the pill so there's no chance I'm pregnant. I'm on the 9th day of my cycle, so it's definitely not my period. I'm a mixture of irritated and genuinely scared that I have serious cervical issues and was just wondering if y'all had any experience with this sort of thing. Sorry for the novel :)  I don't have any experience with this particular procedure, but biopsies can scrape off quite a bit of tissue. It's possible that the bleeding/cramping is from that. If it keeps up for a few more days, maybe call up the gyno and ask about it and/or schedule an appointment if you can afford it. </snippet></document><document><title>Cross post: Has anyone been denied their contraception by pharmacists?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18sspq/cross_post_has_anyone_been_denied_their/</url><snippet>Hi everyone! I'm working on a paper for school, it's for a public policy class. I want to bring up this disturbing trend of people being denied their medication on the basis of a pharmacist's religious beliefs. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, I guess I'm just the most comfortable with you guys. Would it be okay if I shared fragments of some of your stories as part of my paper, to back up news reports and numbers and all that?
EDIT: If you are okay with it, could you put in your age,gender and the state you live in? Throw in a fake name for yourself if you would like.  Yes I have, but it was only once. It was also shortly after all that drama about the pharmacist's right to deny and whatnot. I have had multiple friends who have had to switch gynos for this very reason though.  I haven't, personally, but I used to live near a tiny, independent pharmacy that had a sign in the window saying it did not stock the morning after pill due to moral opposition. Not sure if that would help you at all, and the place no longer exists (it became a financial office about 2 years ago). But I must say, seeing that sign in the modern age was kind of jarring.  I get my pills through my university (they are subsidized, but I only have three choices).  The last time I went there was a new nurse, and I came in for a refill in the middle of my last pack.  I buy them 6 at a time (the max, min being 3) and she gave me a snide comment about running out too soon.  My guess is that she 'forgot' to figure that pill packs have only 28 days, while months have 30-31 on average, not to mention I try to pick up new packs *before* I run out.  I also think there was a little of that Rush Limbaugh idea that you take one pill per sex.  Of course, if that were the case, I'd be in a lot more often! haha

my gp/gyno is in a small town, but she's super progressive and was trying to play the system to get me a nuvaring (but insurance doesn't cover it, of course!).  It was surprising, but she's pretty young, so I guess not so much?  I thought I was going to have to sit through snide 'how loose you are!' comments or something.

What did she say when you called her a snotty bitch?

Disrespect from any service provider should be returned with considerable amplification.  It&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;ll learn.  I live in Canada and have never once had this problem. When I was 14 I was not allowed to pick them up without one of my parents present (which wasn't an issue because they were paying for it then). But as soon as I turned 16 it didn't matter. I wasn't allowed to pick them up for religious reasons, it was more so just a policy.   California, no never. I have bought condoms, the pill, and plan B and was never made to jump through any extra hoops. Now I am on mirena and have an exceptional gyno who listens and is a champion for taking BC that fits in with your life.   This is a government-created problem.  Contraception should be available by mail order if the vendors in your area don&#8217;t want to carry it.  Been denied it by a walk-in clinic doctor once. 

I had a condom break, and wasn't on the pill just yet, though I was thereafter. I was pretty freaked out and went to a walk-in, first thing in the morning. I was the first one through the door and was shown into an examination room right away. 

The doctor asked me what I needed and I told him the condom broke, and I needed something for it. He flipped exactly one shit and told me he couldn't help me, because this was "a woman's problem". He left the room and had to force his front desk nurse to tell me to leave. 

I went to another walk in after and had to wait a few hours. The next doctor, an older gentleman, laughed about how stupid the first guy was and gave me not only the prescription I needed, but a few months free of the pill to start as well, if I remember right.

So it was both the worst and best situation ever; the second guy put me at such ease about everything after, and I am so glad to have met him right at that time.

Edit: I'm in Canada, forgot about that part. Oh my god!!! What the hell is that guy's problem? I think you have to have slightly thicker skin and a more open mind if you are going to be a doctor! (a general "you", in this case, not literally you) Agreed. 

I really don't know what this guy's beef was. It scared the shit out of me and I was terrified I was going to get pregnant. We'd been active for like a year at that point and it was our first (and only) accident... and then he came along and horrified me. 

It worked out in the end... older me would have reported him or something, if I could have. But I was just glad to have taken care of the situation at the time.  Nope, never, in fact most pharmacists have given me a "good for you". I don't even believe they can deny it here.  That happened where I live.A young woman went to the pharmacy to buy some birth control pills.The pharmacist refused to give them to her, even after the woman showed her her prescription.She (the pharmacist) claimed that she had a right to do so,because it was contrary to her religious beliefs to give her those pills.I don't know what happened after, but I remember it being all over the newspapers.   Only in accordance with the law. I'm in southern California and had unprotected sex when I was 13, and went to the drugstore the next day to try to get the morning after pill. I was denied it because legally you have to be 17 or older to buy the morning after pill. I didn't know anyone older than myself who would buy it for me, so I didn't get it. My  next period was five weeks late, so I think I may have gotten pregnant and miscarried early but I'll never know because I never took a pregnancy test. 

I'm 18 now and have never had a need for the morning after pill since then, but I keep two boxes of it on hand just in case. I've also obtained the pill and then the nuva ring from Planned Parenthood without any hassle. </snippet></document><document><title>My Niece is working on her doctoral dissertation and is looking for people willing to take a survey... </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18r762/my_niece_is_working_on_her_doctoral_dissertation/</url><snippet>I was thinking that maybe people here would be able and willing to help her out.

She has posted the survey different places.  I took it upon myself to post here on Reddit to help get more survey takers.  My sister has posted it around sites in Australia where she lives. I ignore the specific US questions then?   Done!  Done:) A thank you to you also!

I wish I could help her out but unlike my beautiful Niece, I am not of mixed heritage.  She is Hispanic and Caucasian and is (in my opinion) absolutely Beautiful. It was a learning experience for me to answer the questions in the survey; apparently I'm not as immune to suggestions from the media as I thought previously :) 
 I wish I could take the survey just to see what she is asking.

She is getting her Doctorate in Psychology and is a wonderful person  You're helping her out just by posting the survey here :) I'm sure she's appreciative of your enthusiasm and support for her!    I'm taking it now. is it bad for me to do feedback on the survey itself? 

OK, 'cause I will. 

The second question, asking my age? 

I'm sorry, "under 18," "18-60," and "60+" seem like unhelpful, too-broad age groups.  I don't know what information you could get out of that, since life is 100% different at 18 and 60, but they're in the same grouping. I will forward the information to her but I think it is too late to change it now.  I am guessing that age isn't as important as the rest of the questions...but again that is a guess

I haven't seen the survey as I am not in the demographic she is looking for.

Thank you for helping her out though, I appreciate it and I am sure she does also. Even if she doesn't think age is "important" you should always collect basic variables like that, otherwise you may completely miss some pattern that is actually relevant to the question you're asking. It's just bad methodology to leave out stuff like that.

I've lost confidence because he's lost interest, and he's lost interest because I've lost confidence. We moved in together (a 1st for him) and things started changing. He says he doesn't get aroused at all, but he masturbates to porn on his phone daily, but won't talk about it because he's ashamed. I've asked him to go to the Dr to check for low testosterone, but he hasn't gone. I honestly don't thing that there is anything wrong with him. We got engaged two weeks ago after a year of dating, and a year of living together. 

I want to sit him down and tell him how this will end based on my divorce 5 years ago:
He loves me, but one day he will meet someone else. He will feel horribly guilty and really try with me to make things work, but he will realize how unhappy he has been. He will try to cut her out of his life. The comparison of how we are and how he could be with her will be so jarring that he will wake up. He will want us both to be happy, and we will end. I'm 31, I want to start a family more than anything, and that's just not going to happen with us, so I will understand.    I'm in a similar (though less serious) situation with my boyfriend.

We haven't had regular sex in a while. I have a higher sex drive than he does, but 99% of the time I am the one initiating. He's even mentioned that he wants to experiment with celibacy (tying into his Buddhism) -- I lost my virginity at 22, so this is a non-starter with me. I've waited too damn long to have a sexless relationship.

I think what you're doing is the right idea. I'm planning on sitting him down today and letting him know that I will not stay in a sexless relationship, that my needs are not being met, and that I need to have sex at least 3 times a week (and that is a compromise on my end, the **bare minimum**), and that he is responsible for initiating. I'm also going to insist that he start stepping up in the relationship - that means penciling in time on his calendar for me, making sure my evenings are free for some "dates", etc. If things don't start changing, I will leave and find someone who is more compatible. It sounds demanding, I know, but I haven't demanded a lot from him (a fact he readily acknowledges) and I think that's part of the reason why he's been taking me for granted.

Since you're married, I'd say you're well within your rights to make the appointment with his doctor to check for low testosterone. And couples counseling would be another good step. Nip these problems in the bud before they fester into gangrenous sludge.

None of this is meant to be advice, since I'm in the same boat. I guess I'm just sharing my problems as well so that others can help us come up with (better?) solutions.

Best of luck. got engaged two weeks ago, not married. I'm in a similar (though less serious) situation with my boyfriend.

Also couples therapy?

Does he know about your past issues? Says he does
He thinks Dr first before therapy
Yes, he knows.       I think you might get some more help/better advice posting in /r/AskMen or /r/relationships

There could be a million things going on with your boyfriend but I don't think he has a problem with low T or that he doesn't love you.  

I personally think you've just gotten to the point in your relationship where you're more in the "security/comfort" stage than in the "attraction" stage.  This happens a lot, sometimes women get there first and sometimes guys get there first.  

The good news is that this doesn't mean he doesn't love you, the bad news is that fixing it generally entails doing some scary shit.

I would guess, at a minimum, that you guys need some time apart both right now and in general on a more regular basis.

On the much, much scarier end of things you may want to think about some kind of non-monogamous arrangement.  You may not necessarily have sex with other people but you might date them, or something.  You'll need to figure that stuff out.

The worst thing that you could do is just not do anything and let the situation stay as it is.  The next worst thing would be to break up without trying to change anything.  

As for asking him to tone down the masturbation, I don't think that's going to change anything and may in fact make things worse.  He's 30 years old, he could masturbate twice a day every day and still be in the mood to have sex three times a day if there were real desire.

Finally, here's a link to a TED talk on desire in LTRs:

I have an interview on Friday though, and I bought some nicer earrings which, unfortunately are definitely not silver or gold. I figured because I'll only be wearing them for an hour, I should be OK (I hope?).

Today I went online and found that some people who are in the same boat have had success with:

* coating the post in clear nailpolish?! - doesn't seem safe

* special hypoallergenic coating (eg: http://www.amazon.com/Jewelry-Shield-Bottle/dp/B002OCO1U2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361244246&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Allergy+Jewelry+Shield)

* plastic coverings for posts
* getting a jeweler to cover the post in rhodium

Does anyone have any experience in any of these?   I do the coating with clear nail polish trick.  It definitely works, and there's nothing dangerous about it (at least that I've discovered in the many years I've been doing it).
Just put a quick coat on the posts and any part that touches your ear before each time you wear the earrings and you'll be fine. I know it sounds insane and unsafe. I know it does. It's not. It works. It's cheap, easy, effective, and non-toxic. I have done this to several earrings, necklaces, and rings. Just reapply if you start having a reaction, or every week or two if you don't want to chance it.  Do I buy non-toxic nailpolish, or does any brand work?  Won't the nailpolish chip off in my piercings? I use Sally Hansen regular clear polish. I don't think there is a special non toxic kind, but since it's dry and you're not eating it, there's nothing to worry about. I've never had a problem with flaking, even for earrings. Just use some polish remover to take it off before you apply a new coat every now and then.  Do I buy non-toxic nailpolish, or does any brand work?  Won't the nailpolish chip off in my piercings?  Have you had any luck with claires sensative ears line? My family has notorious nickel allergies and these have never caused issue.  Have you had any luck with claires sensative ears line?

I work in a jewellery store and let me tell you - rhodium plating will work, but it is quite expensive and also wears off fairly quickly.  You would probably end up paying somewhere in the $30-$60 to plate them, and chances are you would only get a month or two out of them before they starting bothering you again.  

I have tried the nail polish myself with moderate success.  Just make sure your piercings are not super tiny and can accommodate the extra space they will take up.

Three quick questions and it will help me a lot!</title><url>https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KXPMZC</url><snippet>  I took your survey and I'm curious. What are you looking to get out of this? Like, what is your thesis, and whatcha lookin' to prove? :)  My thesis is in the works but it essentially uses Judith Butler's book *Gender Trouble* to try and prove that not only is sexual orientation and gender identity fluid, but sex itself is fluid, proven by the fact that trans* people who transition can have a variety of biological/anatomical features that aren't limited to the usual sex binary. I'm using examples such as hermaphradism and intersex, as well as the idea of trans* people who have taken hormones but not surgery, or top surgery but not gender reassignment, yet define themselves as having a new *sex* to match their true gender....

Simply put: I want to prove (with this survey, and I've succeeded) that gender is a spectrum and sexual orientation is a spectrum (which is pretty widely acknowledged already but never mind) so that I can then *argue* that anatomical sex completes the trifecta and is ALSO a spectrum. Based on philosophical theory, I'm trying to challenge the idea of a sex binary.  So, I'm going to hedge this, because my tone rarely goes over well here. I am not posting this with the goal of besmirching you or someone you know, or trivializing your life decisions. Anyways, something I've always been curious about:

Most, perhaps all, of the feminist theory I've read and had spoken at me rests quite strongly on the idea that gender is purely a social construct, and has no biological determinant. If that is the case, then how do transgenders who were born a man but "always felt like a woman" or "just knew they were really a woman" fit in? In the fluid-gender model of modern feminism, is that even a sensical claim?

Obviously, if you aren't transgendered, you can't answer this, but I'll just put it out there in the hopes of it starting some discussion: If you subscribe to the social construct idea of gender, what makes you transgendered? Is it just the genitalia? First off, just a small point. We are not "transgenders", we are trans people. :) Easy enough mistake to make, but just for future reference, it's an adjective. 

Secondly, the idea of gender being a social construct (to my mind, there's a shit ton of differing ideas) is not that gender *identity* (what we are within) is a social construct, but that gender *roles* are, in fact, what is being spoken about. The majority of people have an innate sense of gender and we've seen that just like sexuality, gender identity is on a spectrum. 

On the other hand, what is being fought against, is that "to be a man means you have to like sports!" or that "to be a woman means you have to want babies!" To be a man or a woman means that...well, you're a man or a woman. Or genderqueer, or agender, or Two Spirited, or whatever your identity might be. 

Take me for example. I'm a trans man. That means I was born with what people claim are female genitalia, but I identify as male. I'm a dude, yo! Does this mean that I like sports, fixing cars, and diggin' the ladies? Actually, I think most sports are silly, I barely know how to run a car, let alone fix one, and I tend to prefer men over women for the most part in my sexual life. This doesn't mean I'm not a man. It just means that I'm a man that likes drawing and reading over sports, that loathes driving, and tends to like men.  Thanks for the reply! That's very interesting.

Though I must reiterate, most of the feminist theory I've encountered *does* assert that gender identity is a social construct; but you made a good argument so I did some reading, and I can't find anything that directly links gender identity to biology. The closest I've could find is wikipedia (and the study it cited that I don't have the brain for at the moment) saying that pre and post natal hormone levels may influence it.  First off, just a small point. We are not "transgenders", we are trans people. :) Easy enough mistake to make, but just for future reference, it's an adjective.

It just means that I'm a man that likes drawing and reading over sports, that loathes driving, and tends to like men.  Wouldn't you be "transgender people"? Since "trans" could technically apply to other characteristics besides gender?

Beyond that, my boyfriend likes reading and drawing over sports and driving by far, and he's plenty manly for me! Interests alone definitely don't define gender, and thanks for pointing that out!

Gender **expression** is a social construct, as in the way you act, talk, dress, etc. 

Gender **identity** has biological roots, determined by epigenetics and brain structure. </snippet></document><document><title>Hey TwoX'ers! I need some help with a misfortunate/fortunate predicament my Girlfriend has.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18skjh/hey_twoxers_i_need_some_help_with_a/</url><snippet>It's not front page worthy but I figured this would be the best way to easily find some practical advice in the shortest amount of time. I see a lot of posts from this subreddit and notice the community is really strong. Since my gf is not a redditor (believe me I have tried) I figured I would ask for her.

It's a simple situation, she has trouble finding bra's and bikinis to fit her. I know I could probably google it and would have to wade through pages and pages of spam and such. I figured this subreddit would offer advice on proven websites or stores that can offer the size bra and bikini she needs. 

She is a 40-32-40 measurement and has a hard time finding these things that fit and look good. 

Any advice?

Feel free to let me know if I have violated any subreddit rules. I have never posted here before.
  /r/ABraThatFits  Holy crap, what an effective resource.  It has helped so very many people.  :)  I'm in a bit more extreme situation since I measure 43-31-43, but it's not too different in practice, except that your girlfriend has slightly more options than I do. I buy my bras at Bras and Honey, Bravissimo, Brastop etc. once I have determined what size to get. Make sure she gets fitted properly, so check out A Bra That Fits. Also, clothes that fit well are also fantastic: If she's really tall like me (I'm 5'11"), clothes from Pepperberry will be too short, especially in the sleeves, but I'm currently wearing a fabulous BiuBiu dress (the fabric quality is amazing!), and it fits a whole lot better. If she's closer to the 5'4" average of British women, Pepperberry has decent clothes :D (BiuBiu is Polish, and women there aren't quite as short as they are in Britain, so they fit me better.) Just follow the measuring guide and remember that 1 inch is 2.54 cm :P</snippet></document><document><title>This helped me so much- TedTalk about vulnerability</title><url>http://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o</url><snippet>  </snippet></document><document><title>Tips for Instead Softcups?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18segb/tips_for_instead_softcups/</url><snippet>Ok so last month I said "ugh! no more tampons!" and did some research, and decided to test out the disposable cups before committing to the more expensive diva/luna/etc (opinions welcome on those too of course). I'm due to start my period tomorrow, and I'm sure there's going to be an epic x-rated comedy routine of me trying to use these... so help! Give me advice, tips, tricks, explanations that it might not say on the box.. thank you ladies!  a couple of things....
1) Practice inserting and removing before you get your period.  Use a little lube if necessary to help getting in if you are a little dry.  You really need to get it properly into position behind your pubic bone.  If it's not positioned correctly, it will leak. 

2) When removing (on period), be sure to keep it as horizontal as possible to keep the fluid in the cup. 

3) If you are going to be out, take a few feminine wipes along.  It can get really messy if you aren't careful when removing. Heck, it can get messy even if you are careful. 

4) Don't forget to wash your hands prior to inserting or removing. 

5) Wear a pantiliner to protect your underwear from the tiny leaks that can sometimes happen when you sneeze.

Edit - formatting 

 Thank you! I will definitely try putting it in before it actually starts.  I have no idea how I'm going to know if it's in place.  Although I heard if you can feel it, you're doing it wrong.  

#5 made me laugh, just an fyi Thank you! I will definitely try putting it in before it actually starts.  I have no idea how I'm going to know if it's in place.  Although I heard if you can feel it, you're doing it wrong.  

#5 made me laugh, just an fyi  i would wear a pad as a backup for your heaviest flow day, until you get used to using the cup. when they're full, they're full. sneeze, fart, cough, whatever = leak. same as a tampon i guess. 

they also make hilarious noises sometimes when you remove them.  oh boy, ok.  and I can't wait for hilarious noises :)  I put mine in standing up at first and it leaked.  You have to be sitting down for it to go in level.  I have used these before because you can use them with sex on your period, and plugs the flood for a little while. They're incredibly messy upon removal, though, and in my experience, they're really more like a plug than like having cup. I'd be prepared for a mess, but perhaps other users had better experiences than I did. Thanks, I'm prepared to be Extremely careful upon removing.. I realllly don't want a horror movie murder scene in my bathroom. Erm, apparently I forgot a word. I meant to say that you can use them ot have sex on your period. (Obligatory PSA: But not for birth control.) (Obligatory PSA: But not for birth control.)   The Instead cups are totally different from the divacup/luna/mooncup etc. so I would consider trying both kinds of cups if you're okay with the general idea of how they work. I tried Instead for a couple months and went Divacup for a few years before I started skipping periods. My personal preference is for Divacup because it's easier to remove in my opinion (partially due to being more substantial all around) and way more reusable, but Instead cups let you have sex while it's inserted...up to you how much you care about these things.

Generic tips: removing them in the shower is pretty convenient for leaks and washing, if that kind of thing doesn't gross you out. If you're reusing, carry around a travel pack of wipes and/or a bottle of water for when you're not near somewhere to rinse. It will take a few tries at least to get the hang of how to insert any cup, so be patient and try before you need to use it. Always have a backup in place just in case something happens (but this is always good advice). I became a god at removing full divacups without getting anything more than my usual wetness on my fingers, but I've also done dumb things like dropping it in the toilet by accident. So I thank my past self for thinking about packing spare tampons to last me until I can boil the cup and clean it at home.

I've been using these for three years. How did I never think of this?  You're a genius!  You can reuse the cheaper (supposedly non-reusable kind) several times. I use one per period (just re-insert after rinsing in the shower). On heavy days, I wear an actual pad instead of a pantiliner because the cup fills up faster and is more likely to overflow/cause accidents. Good luck! It's sooo nice not to have to deal with tampons anymore.   You can reuse the cheaper (supposedly non-reusable kind) several times. I use one per period (just re-insert after rinsing in the shower).

It's sooo nice not to have to deal with tampons anymore.    It goes it sideways. Cup up. Mine would sit behind my pubic bone, I think. Definitely try putting one in before the bleeding starts. Just trust me there. Practice taking it out and don't go anywhere you will need to change it until you have the hang of it. 

I'm saying that because I flung blood everywhere from an overfull cup.  Too late. Stalking you now.  You're a creep.

I am 20 years old, and have never been in a relationship. Never been so much as approached by a guy. For the most part, I am okay with this. Of course I've always wondered what I've been missing, but then I see some if the BS that my friends go through in their relationships, then I think I'm okay. I've been through that phase where I thought I was ugly, undesirable, and unworthy. I'm pretty much over that now. I am overweight (working on it, for me, not for anyone else) and have weird teeth, but for the most part, I am happy with myself. It took a really really long time I get to this place where I am now, as far as self esteem issues go. I'm in college, with good friends and decent grades. I feel like I'm heading somewhere. 

Now, the reason I'm posting. There's a guy. He and I are leaders in a group project. And I think I like him. I really don't know another way to put it. We have to interact a lot as a part of this project. I'm not sure if its just a crush, or if I'm feeling a connection with him. But sometimes I just can't stop think about him. Its so weird. I mean, I've had crushes before, but none were quite like this. I find myself wanting to spend time with him, I feel like we have some stuff in common, I really really look forward to group stuff to work on just to be in the same vicinity. Truth is, I don't know what to do. I've never really put myself out there, I feel completely lost. If someone can offer some kind of perspective on this, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Tldr; I'm a relationship noob, I like a guy, confused as to where to go from here. Any thoughts?  Talk to him. Be yourself. If he's a nice enough guy, he won't blow you off. Try to find out his interests and just be confident. All the corny/cheesy advice about finding out if someone is attracted to you is true.
Something that worked for me personally is a sense of humor/seeing what he finds funny. I find that always works well to break the ice. Good luck!  Thanks :) this is just so new to me that I'm a little scared that he'll just flat out shut me out, or lead me on :s  That's a little extreme! Hahaha. If by chance he did, at least you know then that he's rude and not for you, right?   "Love is a shout into the void"  That's from a book.  I forget which one.  Put yourself out there.  It's scary, and you could get hurt.  One day you will be hurt by love, as all humans on Earth are.  But put yourself out there, because one day you will be rewarded beyond compare.  I don't know how your situation will turn out.  Be yourself, be honest and say "Fuck fear!" because living your whole life in fear that you aren't worth someone's time or energy or love is not living at all.   This speaks volumes to me. I'll try, but honestly I'm scared shitless because I just connected the dots about my feelings for him and I'm seeing him today.  I don't know how I'm goin to act. Oy. This thread has been floating around 2X.  Watch this.  Take the 20 minutes.  I can safely say it kind of changed my worldview.

How do we help her? [Possible trigger]</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18sxj0/boyfriends_mum_is_depressed_and_isnt_eating_how/</url><snippet>I'm hoping that the ladies here who have dealt with anorexia, depression or witnessed somebody with either will be able to give us some insight on what to do.

My boyfriend and I have been together nearly 3 years, I'm 23 and he's 24. His family is wonderful, very kind and caring and always make me feel at home. They had been running their own business for as long as my boyfriend can remember but at the beginning of last year, his dad quit the business and my boyfriend found out that his family was in major, major debt that they had been keeping quiet for a while.

Since then, his mum has been (quietly) upset and their family has had a lot of rocky moments. They're trying frantically to make monthly payments to keep the house. His mum has hip problems and cannot work because of it, so it is up to my boyfriend, his brother and his father. For the better half of the last year, his mum has been on depression medication. Where she used to get up at 7am every morning, she's now going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 11am and not eating until dinner time when she has a tiny portion of food, if any (it seems).

She claims that she's just not feeling hungry and that she knows that she should eat, but she doesn't. She's about 5'7 and now weighs 102lbs. She used to weigh about as much as me (approx 120lbs), if not a little more, but since being on these "meds", she's been getting scarily low in weight.

She does not act depressed around me when I am there, my boyfriend doesn't say that she does either when I'm not there - she seems to be keeping it to herself, but we're both so worried for her health as she's rarely eating (even when she realizes that she should, she just says she's not hungry)  and when she does it, it's minuscule portions of low-calorie foods.

My boyfriend is getting very frustrated with her, I think he's decided that there's not much he can do for her anymore and will just have to wait until she's hospitalized until she realizes how dangerous she's gotten. He says this out of defeat as I know he'd never wish any of his family members a trip to the hospital, but he's been trying his hardest to keep everybody happy and healthy.

I can't say anything to her because I feel as if it is not my place, but it makes me sad to see my boyfriend stress out and worry. 

What can we do? What SHOULD we do? She's a wonderfully caring person who always makes everybody feel at home, but she's been feeling depressed and is now rarely eating. His dad is also a wonderful person and they used to look so happy together. It's unfortunate that there's been such a stress created between the two because of the debt, their family atmosphere is sort of a quiet one now, whereas before it was very open with lots of communication. My boyfriend is getting frustrated now because nobody is talking to anybody about how they're feeling.

Thank you for the advice and care in advanced. I appreciate any words of wisdom that can help my boyfriend help his family.  </snippet></document><document><title>Skin tag on my bikini line, it really needs to go. Help?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18smol/skin_tag_on_my_bikini_line_it_really_needs_to_go/</url><snippet>I've had this god awful thing all my life, it's been ruining bikinis and my sex life for a long time now. I'd rather not cut it off, rip it off, or even tie string around it. The thought of having something rot off my body (and especially down there) sounds so unpleasant. I've heard of creams made for removing skin tags or home made mixtures that causes them to dry up and fall off? Does anyone have experience with this?     I know you said you didn't want to do this, but I thought I'd throw this in there anyway just in case anyone with a similar issue is reading and looking for solutions -
I had a skin tag on my bikini line, and I just want to say that tying a string around it worked!! It was super easy and quick. I used dental floss, and just tied it around the "stem". I tied it on at night, and the next morning the skin tag had turned black and was WAY smaller. By the time I got home that evening it was completely gone, had fallen off at some point and I hadn't even noticed! Totally painless. No bleeding or anything. It was just gone. I couldn't believe I hadn't tried it sooner, it worked so beautifully.
It's really just like dead skin or scab or something falling off, I wouldn't liken it to something "rotting off" your body. The only thing I would mention is to make sure it's tied tightly enough, otherwise it won't work at all.
Anyway, I might sound way too enthusiastic about this, but it really worked out so perfectly for me. I would totally do it again, and really recommend it. I'm glad it worked for you and that you're ok, but that's basically necrotic tissues, isn't it? I imagine there is a real risk of infection with something like that. No not really. This technique is used all the time by primary care physicians. Once you tie a string around it you'be cut off the blood supply and nothing can get back into your bloodstream. The cells just die and fall off, and even if there could be a risk there's not even time for it to get infected as it falls off in less than a day usually.</snippet></document><document><title>Congratulations to Melissa Detora for being the first woman to top 8 a Magic The Gathering Pro Tour!</title><url>http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome</url><snippet>   I'm almost stunned it's taken so long for it to happen.

Almost. Because I spent enough time playing the game to know that in most places, women really aren't ever that welcome. &amp;gt;Because I spent enough time playing the game to know that in most places, women really aren't ever that welcome.

I tried to play at the local card shop in town and the people could not have been less friendly. Each time I was the only women (which struck me as odd at first, but made sense later) and they either refused to talk to me or were straight up rude. I was told I didn't belong and that obviously I wasn't taking it seriously after laughing when the friend I was playing against (who went weekly) said something funny.

Haven't been back since. 

Oddly enough, the people who play on Xbox Live are typically very nice. It's the only xbox game I can play online, chat with my opponent, and not be asked for naked pictures. I want to learn Magic, but this is what I'm afraid of. My boyfriend is willing to teach me but I kind of want to develop it as a "me" hobby first, so I'm trying to find a place to learn around town. However, this situation is what has made me hesitant to try. I am already an introvert with a lot of self-esteem issues, so I think facing a situation like that would turn me off to the game. &amp;gt;Because I spent enough time playing the game to know that in most places, women really aren't ever that welcome.

If you like to play competitively in the shop, you should talk to the owner. A good shop owner would never tolerate this - it's in their best interest to keep as many people coming in the store, male or female. The owner might tell these jerks to knock it off and just let you play in peace.

Not all shops are like this - my boyfriend brought me to the one he frequents and EVERYONE was welcoming and patient (I've only been playing casually since last year). The owner is super freaking cool. For a while, it was definitely a little awkward because I was the only girl there most of the time but everyone got used to seeing me around.

Overall, Magic is just supposed to be fun even if it's competitive. If that guy looked down on you for laughing, he's got bigger issues like carrying a 10ft pole up his butt.  You're totally right, talking to the shop owner would probably get some results. This happened about three years ago and at the time it didn't even occur to me to bring it up, even after talking to other women who had similar experiences when they were the only woman in attendance.

Maybe I just need to get some girls together and go as a group... see how it feels if there is more than one of us.  I'm almost stunned it's taken so long for it to happen.

I have a few questions. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18svf9/just_got_mirena_i_have_a_few_questions/</url><snippet>So I had the Mirena put in on Thursday. I am curious about a few things. 
1. Will my SO feel it? The strings feel kinda long, but I think they're really like 1cm. in length. 
2. Will it get tangled with a tampon? I haven't used one since I am no longer bleeding. Thank God!!!!
3. How long till I can have sex after it being put in? 
4. I have been having real bad cramps in the morning when my bladder is more full after I wake up. And also while I am working out. Is this normal? 
5. Will I still have a period? I know some women do and some women don't. 
And 6. Will I know if it comes out? 
Any answers will help me!!!
Thanks!!!  1) He may at first but the strings will soften up. I haven't had any partners mention it.
2) Nope, they're short, but I've heard they don't always play well with diva cups.
4) Every woman is different, but I don't think it's abnormal
5) I think 20% have no period but you should have a MUCH lighter period. Think one pantiliner a day.
6) Once your body adjusts to it, it should be pretty obvious if it comes out because you'll go through hormonal adjustments again. Many women check for their strings but I am not in the habit of doing it and my doctor said my strings are so short I'm just going to make myself anxious for no reason.  1.  After about a week, they kinda get smushed up there, never to be heard from again.  
1.  Never had that happen, but I stopped getting my period!
1.  Ask your doctor, but I don't think I waited that long.  Maybe like 4 days?
1.  I cramped the day it was put in, and a little throughout the next week.  I think if you're putting pressure on it (like a full bladder) it may feel more crampy. You DID just put a foreign object into your body, and it will take some time to get used to it.  I honestly forget it's there, although once in a while, on my fake period (because I don't bleed anymore)  I get a little cramping but nothing serious.
1. I didn't!  But you could have a normal one, a lighter one, etc.
1. You'll know if it comes out because it'll be in your panties.  :)  </snippet></document><document><title>Just another regular broken heart that could really use your help. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18slhh/just_another_regular_broken_heart_that_could/</url><snippet>Hello ladies. I just I feel I'm going crazy. If you could just take the time, and share something with me. Sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting, but the truth is, ever since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me a year ago, I feel like the most nauseating animal in the world's shit.

Let me give you a quick background. When I met him, I was a mess. I was doing horrible in college, I had the worst relationship with my family, I used to smoke a lot, I had no motivation to do anything I pretty much lived for getting wasted on the weekends.

I met him at college and we got along really great. He was pretty distant at first, I remember I was the one who asked him out the first time, and I was also the first to kiss. It may look like I was going too quickly for him, but everyday he told me he felt amazing with me. He started helping me out with my assignments, all of the sudden I started getting higher grades, I started talking to my family again until he finally asked me to be his girlfriend. Thus, every friend I had, everyone in my family fell in love with him. It was really great, for a few months. 

As time flew by, we started disagreeing in lots of things. Little things, like, he didn't like surprises, and he freaked out when I lost my keys, he once warned me that as soon as things started to get out of our hands he would leave me, for good. It all started going wrong, he wasn't accepting some of my friends, for some reason, he was angry most of the time. I remember always trying to cheer him up, I was very in love with him, so there's little he could do to make me mad. But things just got worse, and worse, and I tried to save my relationship countless times, until he broke up with me... 

...for a month, until he realized he was making a huge mistake and called me and told me he was really sorry, and he told me he wanted to get back. Friends and family were still in love with him, I never really told them the other side of the story and they encouraged me to start the relationship again. So I accepted him back. Yes, it is that kind of story. We had some good times again, but it all started going wrong again, it was like rewinding a cassette and playing it again. This time he was aggressive sometimes, he never beat me but he used to raise his voice a lot. I tried again to save my relationship countless time again, but he broke up with me again. But that didn't stop him from calling me, to tell me I was the only person he felt he could be himself, to tell me he couldn't stop thinking about me, that sort of things. 

I won't lie, I enjoyed him calling me, I had this idea that we were meant to be together, because he was my big savior, right? The one who saw through my stormy personality and handled me just right. We got back together. The last time we were together things were really shitty, we went on a trip with my friends and he hit on a friend of mine while ignoring me, and I just lost it, I couldn't complain because it instantly made me to his eyes an irrational bitch. This time it only lasted for two weeks until he broke up with me again. I just really lost it so I told him to never talk to me again. 

It's been a year, and this guy still calls me. Worst thing is I always answer, he says he feels bad for the things he did to me, and that he felt like magic the time we spent together. It may look like it's a lie easy to figure out, but believe me, he cries, and he hold my hands and tell me he is a victim of his personality. It bends me like I was made of rubber. But, he doesn't want to come back, in fact, he's seeing other girls right now. But he still calls me! And I just told him he must stop calling me, he must stop talking to me that way. I know what I have to do, I have to walk away but, every time, the thought of him finally not calling me is just, it's like vertigo. I feel a hole inside, I'm so afraid of losing his attention, and I have come to realize that maybe it's not that I still love him, maybe I just have some serious, psychological problem. How can one be so attached to a guy like this? Right? Why am I so afraid of losing something I know it's killing me inside? 

I read all your problems, I have used some of your advice, I started going to the gym and I'm looking better. Though I haven't accepted anyone's invitation out, I know there are some guys out there. My friends tell me I don't need a psychologist, and that I just need to get over this guy. But it's been a horrible year, I just can't seem to get over this situation and I'm really starting to freak out. What do you girls think? Anyone has come out of something like this?   Love is an addiction. 

[That's not a metaphor.](http://www.bing.com/search?FORM=UP22DF&amp;amp;PC=UP22&amp;amp;dt=020513&amp;amp;q=love+addiction+similar+to+cocaine)

In order to escape, you must survive a little Hell. But you can escape, and it's worth the pain. 

Just don't trust yourself. An addict will say anything, believe anything, do anything...

If you have friends and family who will keep you from making a mistake, now's the time to connect with them. You'll need the back-up.  Yeah, I ended up here with the random button, not sure how my being here is perceived (wether this is considered a safe zone away from guys).

I've seen your problem before, it's a symbiotic relationship, you both are dealing with issue and require a strong partner; the problem lies in one of you can be strong... for a short while but you'll both inevitably hit these rough patches. I know because I have this incessant need to go out with girls who need help.

You need to learn to deal with these issues without the crutch of some one else, until you can do that you'll always be searching for this guy who can support you 100% emotionally 24/7 and no one can do that. As for the guy he's got his own issues he needs to deal with, and it's not healthy for you to keep ties with him like this. Cold Turkey. You need to sever the connection... it's a harsh truth. 

I'm also sorry for your situation.

(Fair warning: wall of text)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ss9i/hey_twox_i_wanted_to_share_with_you_ladies_what_i/</url><snippet>Today was a good day. It was so good, that I realized something really important. The past few months have been a really dark place. I&#8217;m a student in college, and over winter break I broke up with my boyfriend of 3-4 months. This may not seem like a long time, but I haven&#8217;t been in many relationships. I have been &#8220;with&#8221; plenty of guys, but never in a committed, monogamous relationship until this past semester. On the outside, he was a great guy. An international model, smart, good with money, made it clear that he really liked me. So, obviously I responded quickly and easily. My last boyfriend had been in high school, and it was really nice to have someone who really liked me, wanted to date me. Will refer to as B.


Now, here&#8217;s the first thing that made it confusing. I, at the time and still do, have feelings for someone else (M) - Strong feelings that I haven&#8217;t felt in a long time. But, he wasn&#8217;t, and still isn&#8217;t, ready for a relationship even if he also had or has feelings for me. He was in a (from what I understand) verbally abusive relationship with someone for ~3 years and isn&#8217;t prepared to let himself be put in that position again. So, perhaps because I was looking for someone to fill that place or some other reason buried deep in my psyche, I allowed myself to become infatuated with B.


So I quickly fell into this relationship with B, which started out as cute nights alone and popcorn and weed and dexter, and eventually became Denial with a capital D. I ignored the signs that appeared even before we started dating. He lied to me about drinking and driving- insisting and insisting that it was important that I trust him and believe him, even though one of my friends had clued me in that he had been drinking before he drove over to our party. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and believed him. I ignored his signs of instability, like that he has ADHD and Dyslexia and becomes a morose, unhappy person when he takes his meds, only to be cured, according to him, by smoking weed at the end of the day. Every day. (Another thing I&#8217;m pretty sure he would lie to me about- I&#8217;d ask him if he smoked previously and even though I could tell, he would say he didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t question it.) Now, I like to smoke weed as much as anyone (we live in the evergreen state for heaven&#8217;s sake), but B would go from seemingly angry, untalkative and even rude from his Concerta to acting like a 5 year old. Had to be taken care of, couldn&#8217;t communicate, needed everything to be done for him. He also didn&#8217;t want to have sex after he smoked (would try, and then even would go so far as lay down on top of me because there was &#8220;no use because I&#8217;m not going to come soon&#8221;.) I never once had an orgasm with him. I also requested he go down on me, he said he thought it was gross. I recently found out that he told a friend it was because he thought it would be weird with me. Conversations were always either talking about him, or if I wanted to talk about ANYTHING in my life, his response was always &#8220;cool.&#8221; I can&#8217;t think of one time he asked me about my art, my classes, anything. When I confronted him about this when I broke up with him, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just not an inquisitive person&#8221;. 


B lied about anything that would make him look bad. After I found out he had hooked up with a girl I wasn&#8217;t exactly fond of, he lied and said she gave him head. Turns out they had sex. He lied to me about when he was coming over so he could drive around and smoke weed with other girls. I couldn&#8217;t count how many times he told me small lies, like when he was going to come to my house, how much he had smoked, who he was hanging out with. When I would catch small inconsistencies in his story, he would insist that I was remembering wrong.

I blamed myself for not liking him. He was the ideal guy, right? Just because we&#8217;re different doesn&#8217;t mean we couldn&#8217;t have fun and be together? Even if he was constantly talking about his life as a model in NY, about how much he hated the school, how he was moving to Australia&#8230; And then he would say things like how he was considering staying in WA to be with me, how important I was to him&#8230; 

When I went home to my family and friends for winter break and he went home to Cali, I realized how awful everything was. I realized how much I was being used, how much he devalued me, how much I had just been floating. Smoking because he was, drinking because that&#8217;s when I felt the happiest with him even though he would ditch me for bigger parties, only to come to my house angry when I told him I was going to sleep if he wouldn&#8217;t tell me when he was coming over, just so he could sleep in my bed. Sex became painful because he didn&#8217;t turn me on anymore or make any effort for me to enjoy myself, and when I would come back to the room he would be downstairs watching south park. He just didn&#8217;t respect me, plain and simple, so I stopped respecting myself. I had lost who I was.


I broke up with him over winter break and immediately felt better about myself. I started talking to M again because I had avoided being alone with him/talking to him while dating B for fear of remembering what I was missing. I was making lots of art, spending time with friends as well as alone, thinking about M and how excited I was to see him and just be around him. I was determined to just be his friend, be near him, talk to him. That sort of happened, except I started thinking that maybe, just maybe, he would be ready. We talked about it when he saw my intentions. He still wasn&#8217;t, and in my head I knew that, and all of his reasons are so valid that it almost makes it harder- because there&#8217;s still that hope. That &#8216;someday&#8217; hope. I haven&#8217;t seen him very much the past couple weeks, but he&#8217;s still there. I blacked out two weekends ago, and the one of the few things I remember is when he talked to me at our party. I drew him a valentine. I&#8217;m giving it to him later tonight. It&#8217;s not weird I hope, it&#8217;s just a wolf and a request to play double dash soon.

During all of this, B had been trying to get back into my life. Not necessarily in a romantic way, but he came and made us dinner- I consented so I could get my things back from him and I could get his shit out of my room. It was awkward as hell. I pretty much ignored him the whole time, which was easy because he didn&#8217;t say anything. It had been a little while, and my roommates had told me they wanted to stay friends with him, so I sent him an invite on FB to our party the other weekend. I don&#8217;t remember if he came or not- this was when I blacked out. (First time I&#8217;ve never remembered anything except small details) But he was sort of just around. My roommates sold him weed, so he was there for that. He came to my roommate&#8217;s rugby game and stood next to us. I was cordial but for the most part ignored him. That was when I found out that he lied to me about having sex with the aforementioned girl, and I was livid. I realized that he had been lying to me and I had been lying to myself. He showed up at my house that night, and it just pissed me off to no end. I didn&#8217;t confront him, didn&#8217;t even look at him. He left a little after but it just completely ruined my night. That was when I made a decision that he wasn&#8217;t going to be welcome in my house anymore. I told my roommates it&#8217;s not cool if he&#8217;s over here when I am, that if they need to get him weed they need to go give it to him, not the other way around. 


Today, I had an awesome day. While preparing my print, it didn&#8217;t turn out the way we wanted it to, but I was still really happy because we can fix it and I think it will turn out better than we planned. I worked on my French homework and essay and felt really good about the progress I made (I&#8217;m going to the library to keep working on it in a bit). I had a good workout after a few weeks of difficulties including a shitty indoor race and some disappointment from my coach and disappointment in myself. I went and had dinner with a friend who is visiting and I started talking to her about the decision I made last night and about my feelings for M. I got home, and then immediately realized what today was. It was the first day where I felt like me again. It was the first day I&#8217;ve been happy, really happy and fun and joyful in months and months. Maybe it was because I fully acknowledged the wrong that B had done to me, I fully acknowledged that even if I have these feelings for M I&#8217;ll probably just have to wait them out, and even so, I shouldn&#8217;t be sad that I love someone. I realized how unhappy I had been for the past few months. How it wasn&#8217;t okay that I wouldn&#8217;t want to go to class, I was always tired, I wanted to come home and lay in bed, go on reddit, how I felt like I needed to smoke weed to be happy or to sleep. I came home and started telling my roommates this, and I completely and totally broke down. I cried because I didn&#8217;t want to be my dad who was depressed his whole life until a few years ago, when he started talking to a therapist after my mom left him. I cried because I realized how much self-respect I had lost in the past few months without realizing it. I cried because I had become someone I didn&#8217;t want to be. I cried because I was scared I wouldn&#8217;t be as happy as I was today tomorrow or the day after&#8230; And now, I feel good. I feel tired, I feel used, but I feel like I&#8217;m going to be okay. I feel enlightened about what I want out of a relationship, and how the value I place in myself is internal, stemming from my own psyche, my own attitude, my beauty, my art, my intelligence. It isn&#8217;t, and shouldn&#8217;t be, about anyone else. 

If you read all of this, thank you. I've seen this community be so beautiful and supportive, and I wanted to share my story with you guys. I hope this story doesn't come across as a "dear diary". I'm not really sure what I'm looking for by posting here... I just needed to write. So, thanks for reading. It's nice to meet you.


TL;DR - recently cut self-absorbed, perpetually lying ex out of my life, had a wonderful day and realized how unhappy I had been. Realized that I am in control of my happiness and attention, not anyone else. Realized that my self-respect and confidence should be the most important thing, that I'm okay with where I am right now and I hope that you are too.  </snippet></document><document><title>Why I Won't Support One Billion Rising [Huffington Post]</title><url>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/natalie-gyte/one-billion-rising-why-i-wont-support_b_2684595.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&amp;amp;src=sp&amp;amp;comm_ref=false</url><snippet>  I see her point about how this "awareness-raising exercise" won't necessarily make a difference and might even be seen as condescending or trivial, however, she seems to basing that view off a superficial evaluation of the event. 

Many of the events held during the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s in the US and during other revolutionary periods in human history didn't have a direct impact on unhinging institutionalized racism or sexism or oppression, but it did help draw attention to the cause, which got more people to openly support the cause and do more to make a direct impact. 

Activism is not solely about attacking the negative aspects of the status quo through direct physical or legal action. Humans are emotional and social, and are, to some extent, moved by grand expressions of shared emotion and opinion from other humans. A day of dancing or singing or marching alone will not revolutionize a culture or society, but it might bring in more people who would support such a revolution.  I think it is a mistake for activists to put each other down publicly. There are many ways to say to the media, "We have different views and different ways to go about what we are doing, but we are all fighting for the same thing."  </snippet></document><document><title>Roommate is uncomfortable with having my boyfriend stay over. Is this something I can talk to her about or do I just have to suck it up?  </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18t40p/roommate_is_uncomfortable_with_having_my/</url><snippet>Semi-rant, mostly just looking for advice though. Ok, so some back story. 

We first became roommates last semester and she was (is) very quiet and shy. I would try starting conversations with her and they would just die after a few back and forths. She never leaves the room apart from her classes; if she's hungry, she gets food and brings it back to the room. We have sat in silence for hours, as I've given up trying to force conversations.

She's a nice girl though. When we do talk, she's very sweet and she always offers me food like snacks or if she makes like mac n' cheese or something. But I'd be lying if I said she wasn't a little weird. One example is she judges characters on tv for the decisions they make. It's a little hard to explain but I think part of it is she doesn't "get" it. Like she doesn't understand that a character acts a specific way because they are portraying someone excessively dumb/crazy/silly, she just thinks they're stupid. We were watching Friends once and it was one of the episodes where Ross was dating his student and she was having a water balloon fight in the hallway with her friends to show that she was much younger than Ross. Anyway the conversation goes a little like this

"What are they doing"

"Ross is going out with a student of his and everyone is making fun of him for it cause she's so much younger."

"No, what are they doing&#8230;"

"Having a water balloon fight in the hallway?"

"How old are they?"

"Idk she's in college so like our age? 20-22 I guess"

"Oh&#8230; Okay&#8230;"

"What do you mean ok?"

"Well why are they having a water balloon fight in the hallway? That's weird. Idk I guess cause I've never been a water balloon fight, it's just weird."


I let the conversation end after that but I just found it weird how she judged that part of the show so specifically. 

ANYWAY. The point. Last semester I had asked if it would be cool if my boyfriend could stay for a weekend, Fri-sunday night, and if she'd be alright with it. She said yeah, she had no problem with it. That was approx. a week or two in advance. The weekend comes, she says she's going back home for the weekend. My boyfriend actually couldn't get to me until Saturday night so not wanting to lose a day and have my boyfriend travel for nothing (not nothing, but a much shorter trip than planned), I asked her on Sunday when she got back if it would be ok for my bf to stay one more night into monday. I told her if she's uncomfortable to just let me know and we'll figure it out. Again she said yes that it's fine, and, mind you, I had asked her when she got back around 3. So it's 10:30pm me and the bf are just hanging out watching tv, not even cuddling (he's on the bed I'm on the laptop at my desk), she calls me into the kitchen, said that she spoke to her parents and they're really uncomfortable with him being there so he has to leave. I'm kind of shocked, and caught off guard so i wasn't in the mental capacity to say "um NO you said it was ok, it's your room not your parents, your in college now, also that's completely rude and unfair to my boyfriend, cause now he has to leave at 11pm and he won't be home until 1 going on 2" so I caved and was like oh ok. I told my boyfriend and we were both really upset for a little bit, but then he left. 

I spoke with her that week and told her that it's my room too and that we should work something out because I have a right to see my boyfriend and if you're uncomfortable that's one thing, but you're parents really have no say, I'm not saying to lie to them, because I completely understand if that's something you have trouble with, but it's not their place. We compromised that she'd just let me know when she was going home so he could come down. That proved tricky however, cause his work schedule didn't always coincide with her going home, and I ended up going home a lot more weekends, just cause it was easier.

However, this semester I don't really have the money to go home all the time (I have to take public transport) plus I'd like the privacy and freedom of having my boyfriend come down to visit me. This weekend he was able to come down and I told her ahead of time. Again he wouldn't be able to come down until Saturday so I asked her at the beginning of the week if it was alright for him to stay until Monday and she said she it was ok, and too see if it made her uncomfortable.

Personally I thought the weekend was great. When my roommate came back on Sunday I made sure there was no overt pda to make her uncomfortable. If we were both sitting on the bed, I wouldn't even let him lay on me. I did everything to make her comfortable. It was still like talking to a rock, but I thought we did good. 

She tells me after he left tonight that she was really uncomfortable. I asked when, in case it was something we did that I could fix, and she tells me she was uncomfortable the whole time, and that she couldn't even sleep that night. 

What do I say to her? I don't want her to be uncomfortable but am I wrong for thinking she's being unreasonable? Obviously I won't have him stay an entire weekend while she's also here, but how is one night so terrible? Is this something I can talk to her about to try and remedy or do I just have to work around it? Also me and the bf have a concert in late March that's near my school. It's on a monday but I didn't think that would be a problem cause he could just crash at my dorm and then leave tuesday morning. Is it going to be a problem now with her? I can't have him drop me off at 2am and then drive 2 more hours to go home, especially after a show where we're both exhausted.

Edit: ALSO she came into the room one morning and said that there was a guy and girl gettin' it on in the shower. I asked her if she told them to stop or if she wants me to get the RA. and she was like "no they're in college, they're just having fun it's whatever. it's weird but im not gonna tell them to stop." So it's ok for people to have sex in the same place where you shower and brush your teeth at the same time, but me and my boyfriend cant SLEEP in the same room.

Edit: typos/ sorry for wall of words

**TLDR: Shy reserved roommate is uncomfortable with my boyfriend staying over for one night. Is this something I can talk to her about? Or do I have to deal with it? Also concert next month, plan was bf was going to crash here, now what?**    I was that shy roommate during my undergrad, so I'll say something.

When you have your boyfriend over you're bringing someone who she doesn't know into her most personal space. This always bothered me and I think it bothers her as well. Hell, even if I knew the person very, very well I'd be upset with my space being invaded. I never said anything to my roommates and I think it was very difficult for her to say anything to you. Your edit with the bathroom story, I think, backs up my intuition that your roommate and I are alike. The reason why she didn't say anything then is because (1) the bathroom isn't really personal space and (2) if it did bother her that two people were having sex in the bathroom, it would have bothered her more to speak up about it.

Regarding her not talking to you: it's nothing personal. If she's not interested in talking to you, then she won't. Your roommate sounds nice. She's very nice! Yeah I totally respect and understand that, I just wanted to see if maybe I had leeway with one night, but everything you all have been saying is very right. How should I ask her about the concert in March? She's very nice! Yeah I totally respect and understand that, I just wanted to see if maybe I had leeway with one night, but everything you all have been saying is very right. How should I ask her about the concert in March?  Just to clarify (as I am not an American and am unsure re college dorms): 

Do you literally share a bedroom?

If so, then I think she's well within her rights to not want to have to sleep with a guy in the room. 

If you share a place, but have separate rooms then I think you have a little more wiggle room for negotiations.      a few things:  
  
-it's understandable that it makes her uncomfortable. I know it sucks a lot for you and your boyfriend (and it seems like you're both being really respectful and considerate, by the way) but you are sleeping in the same room, and you would be bringing someone of the opposite sex that she doesn't really know into her personal space. She sounds like she's really shy and/or introverted so sharing a room with a roommate in general is probably a challenge itself.  
  
-If her parents really did say that he can't sleep there, well...they have no say in that because you're all adults and you guys don't live in her parent's house. They don't make the rules for the dorm building.  
  
-Have you straight up asked her *why* your boyfriend being there makes her uncomfortable? Because it seems like she just gave you general answers and not a specific reason as to what was causing her discomfort with the situation. It could be the general fact that he's staying overnight, or just that you guys are sleeping in the same bed. If you find out the specific reason, you can try to work from there to figure out a solution.
  
-try to compromise. Ask her if she's okay with him sleeping on an air mattress on the floor. It's not an ideal situation for you and your bf, but at least he'd be able to stay overnight. If her issue is that you guys are sleeping in the same bed in the room you two share, then that would be resolved.  
  
-next year, get a single room! seriously, if your only dorm options are a shared double or a single alone, go with the single if you have a boyfriend.   </snippet></document><document><title>I need help. Post abortion all I want to do is be pregnant again. Is this normal? </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qtlz/i_need_help_post_abortion_all_i_want_to_do_is_be/</url><snippet>I regret my decision but I'm learning to live with it. I regretted it immediately and the whole process was unbearably traumatizing. It was just god awful. All I want to do it be pregnant again though. I get angry when I hear others are pregnant and keeping it. Especially younger kids. I feel alone. I am not ready for a kid but all I want is to go back and be pregnant again. I feel so fucking empty and so deeply guilty.  It hurts so deep that i cant even explain it. Can any body relate?   You're problems are real. It's a hard experience, pro-choice or not. People get abortions because of so many reasons, sometimes they are facing pressures to live up to a certain thing, or having money issues, any number of things other than 'I don't want to be pregnant right now, this is 100% the right choice.' Sometimes you have to replace the 'don't' want a baby with 'can't. 

You are obviously at a fertile age, you can get pregnant. Your body was ready. But your circumstances weren't right, otherwise you wouldn't have had to make that choice. It's a hard one. It's normal to feel guilt, but remember not to dwell, this will get easier in time. Unfortunately you will possibly remember this as one of the hardest times of your life. But you will get through it. Many have before you, and many people will in the future. 

You have your own unique set of circumstances, that make it feel like the worst thing ever. There are people who can help, and resources available to you. Use them! Just have a chat, connect with someone via a shared experience. You'll be surprised how many have been through similar. 

Now hormones. You're body would have kicked into baby mode. You have all these dramatic changes going on, then here comes yet another change. Now you're readjusting. This takes a few days. Take care of yourself. Do something that makes you feel good when you're PMSing. Chocolate, fries, for me it's fettuccini carbonara. But also, try and eat some fruit and nice things for your body. Drink water all that. 

Think about hormones, like teenage girl hormones. That's your bodies reaction to big changes. What's happening to you is a real emotional upset, but you also have crazy chemicals in you which are putting a hard edge on those problems. Your whole body has been through a shake up. The obvious solution? Have another baby, this will fix it. And you may not have even consciously thought that, it's a huge hormonal urge telling you to, and it will feel right because as you said you weren't too keen on doing this. It will pass, and one day when it's right, you will have a little one. You know you're capable. This will fade one day, into a distant past before the time you and your future child. Focus on yourself now though, you need it.

Hugs to you lady. If I knew you I'd bring a movie and a care package and we'd sit and bitch and laugh and cry about shit til you felt better. I hope I helped.

Any traumatizing experience like this could benefit from a few sessions with a good therapist.   I might be downvoted for this, but hear me out: you should not feel guilty, you don't have to regret this -- you did what you thought was right for you, and there's nothing wrong with that. What you feel now is the hormones speaking and - possibly - years of hearing, that you should feel bad after an abortion working their way into your head.

Don't even think about getting pregnant again, this won't fix the emptiness and guilt. What you should do, is find a therapist you can trust and talk to them. Don't let your feelings rule your life right now. 

I've been there - you need to talk about this, or else it might drive you into making very, very bad decisions. Stay strong, hun. It gets better. From personal experience, telling a person that their feelings aren't legitimate doesn't do much good. Have you ever had a boyfriend tell you that your anger towards him is just because of your hormones/period? It's kind-of like that. I agree that it might be too early to really have perspective on the OP's entire situation, but if she says she regrets it, those feelings should be welcomed and accepted without judgement. Some people regret their abortions just like some people regret many other choices they might have made in life. That should be OK. Personally, judging my feelings as being "just hormones" or entirely based on societal coercion made me feel worst after my abortion. It's like I wasn't allowed to feel what *I* really felt. 

I agree with you on everything else, especially the part about getting help, but I really wanted to bring this up.

I agree with you on everything else, especially the part about getting help, but I really wanted to bring this up.  I probably phrased this wrong, since I'm not a native speaker of the English language. What I wanted to say is more along the lines of "you need to work your way through those things you feel now, as they are temporary". I never meant this to sound like they're illegitimate - I know they're very, *very* real - it's just that they're trauma, and trauma should be treated accordingly. The most important question here is - *why* the OP is feeling the way she feels, not focusing on the feeling itself, as this leads to only more guilt and pain.

I agree with you on everything else, especially the part about getting help, but I really wanted to bring this up.   I had this problem. After my abortion, all I wanted was to have that feeling of being pregnant again, even though I knew in my head it was a terrible idea. In a moment of weakness, I had unprotected sex with a fling and got pregnant again. Now I'm in an even worse place, having placed her for adoption and wanting nothing more than to take her back. 

The only advice I can give is to find a method of birth control that you can't screw up (IUD, Nuvaring, Depo Shot) and use it IMMEDIATELY to get you past this part. I'm having an IUD put in next week, and that's just in time for me. I know I'll get past this urge to have another baby to replace the one I just lost, but I need help right now. When my emotions take over from my head, it's good to know that I'm still protected. This story really bothered me for some reason, more than any other abortion story I've read. It made me feel terribly sad for and yet almost upset with you. But there are moments like these where I thank god that although I may get emotional about lots of things, my miscarriage was not one of them.  Oh, I'm upset with me, too. It was a terrible, stupid decision to have unprotected sex - but by the time I realized that, it was too late. I was still so depressed from the first abortion that I couldn't stand the thought of another one. I just wish I knew then what I know now...I would have had it.           </snippet></document><document><title>Oxytocin: Doesn't Stop Prairie Voles From Cheating (but does a lot of other stuff)</title><url>https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/oxytocin</url><snippet /></document><document><title>workout clothes: what do you love? what to look for?

Thanks!  [Enell](http://enell.com/) makes the best sports bras for well endowed ladies. Trust me. Their bras might be a little ridiculous looking sometimes (you know the whole 10+ clasps part) but they work. I ride horses and it is common knowledge in horseland that if you have a larger chest, you need an Enell bra. They are bounce proof (and riding is a very bouncy sport). 

Anyway, I dont think you need fancy workout clothes. I get all my workout clothing from Old navy when they have sales. I like their compression capris, I've got two pairs. Then I just wear a racerback workout tank top and a sports bra, I'm good to go. I immediately thought of Enell when I saw this thread. They are a little pricey, around $60, but totally worth it. The sizing is different from other bras, so double check! You will probably be surprised at what size you are (I was!) but it needs to fit well to work best.

Thanks!  Nordstrom's (if you have one locally) will have Freya and Panache, who both make a very decent sports bra.    As a C cup I don't really have an opinion on sports bras, but I know that I HAVE to have a drawstring on my workout pants/capris. If you lose a little weight and don't have the drawstring it sucks to have to pull your pants up during a workout 100X.  I live in work-out leggings. They keep everything in place and don't get in the way (running with flared pants makes me feel like I'm going to trip).

It may also be to your benefit to drop in to /r/ABraThatFits to ensure you're wearing the right gear for your ladies.  Looks like you've got plenty of input on the bra situation...but as for other articles of clothing like bottoms, personally, whether I'm running or not, I prefer to wear leggings or tight-fitting yoga-type pants. 

It's awfully common lately to hear certain kinds of people (*cough* *cough*) insinuate that there is no argument, regarding comfort or otherwise, for wearing clothing that tight to work out in, instead it suggests that you're looking for attention or trying to flaunt and distract with your sexuality. **Fuck** those people, because working out in leggings for me is comfortable as hell. 

If you find a particularly comfortable pair, it *feels* like you're wearing nothing at all - full range of motion, breathable fabric, optimal compression, no loose material getting in your way whilst running. If you personally have any qualms about wearing them, you can always wear a long, loose-fitting T-shirt on top for a little extra coverage. And it doesn't matter what your body type is, either - don't be afraid try them out and see how you like them.  I've been either the high normal BMI or a bit overweight, and usually in my thighs, so I have never considered that anyone would be distracted or otherwise by me... but I do often worry about how (bad) I look in them and really appreciate your words. 

I was wondering if I was going to go for the little bit looser pants and If I really felt the I still needed to wear the oversize shirt, over the bra and the tank, but I think I will say fuck it and work on what feels right and not how I think everyone else views me.  

Thanks for the reminder! 
  Sports bras have never been supportive enough for athletic activity in my case - I usually wear a "minimizer" bra instead.

Otherwise, I wear whatever's comfortable - stretchy/loose pants and a tee-shirt, ususally.   I'm a 34DD and I HAVE to wear a regular bra under the most high impact bra I can find. I cannot stand when they start bouncing while I'm running and especially for soccer. So you're not alone in that aspect.
As for clothes, I usually wear running shorts (nike, adidas, etc.) and a cotton or athletic t-shirt. The athletic ones are better because they wick away the sweat but the cotton ones are cheaper and I personally have a ton of them I just figured I was doing it wrong the whole time... Sometimes, I'd like to take off my t-shirt, but feel silly with the bra straps and the T-tank tap straps.  

Guess that's a hang up I need to deal with. No one else cares..  36DD, moving comfort bras are awesome. I don't feel any pain while running.   I just posted [this bra](http://www.titlenine.com/product/313801.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;amp;from=fn#.USJmrlrDVk9) in another thread about  running. It's called the "Last Resort" and looks pretty heavy duty! It's expensive, but maybe you could save it for just running and other high impact exercises.

I would say a good pair of crops are worth investing in, since you can wear them for lifting and running, and the compression will help support your muscles. Spending a little bit more is worth it in my opinion, as long as you take good care of them. I wash my workout gear separate from everything else as I've found the cotton fibers from other clothes tend to break off of pill on my workout stuff. Also don't use fabric softener, I've heard that reduces technical fabric's sweat wicking ability. 

My most favorite workout brand is Lululemon - sooo pricey but such cute stuff!  I'm a 32 DDD and I also run.  I have advice I'm sure others will tell you not to follow, but it's the only way I can run without feeling like I've bruised my girls.  I get a really high quality sports bra (without underwire) in a size 1-2 below my size.  A lot of sports bras only have cup sizes based on average band size.  So, a standard d sports bra is made for a 36-38 band, which won't work.  While an a is frequently made for a 32 band (but cups will be too small).   So I go somewhere in between and it holds them in.   I have C cup, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but [This](http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/womens-armour-bra-dd-cup/pid1233078-001) is my favorite sports bra.  I have never felt so well supported.  It's incredible.  I suggest it even though we have a size difference, because it seems like they put a lot of effort and thought into my size, and I think it would translate to larger sizes. Good luck! :) That looks like it might hold it all in... I will have to see if they are sold around here. Thanks!   This is a little outside the clothing area, but if you ever have any trouble with chafing, [Bodyglide](http://www.bodyglide.com/) is wonderful. Great if you want to run in shorts but have larger thighs.  If you ever have trouble with your bra, some swipes under the offending straps will also help. :)   Most crucial running gear: compression shorts.  Other shorts always ride up and bunch in the thighs and drive me nuts; compression shorts are worth every goddamn penny.

I double up sports bras sometimes too.  You do what you gotta do. See, this is where i am behind. I have never heard of them called compression short. I will watch for this now.  You might just call them something else.

I know I can talk about it here in 2X but just some more help and advice couldn't hurt either! If there isn't, is anyone else in the same boat as me and would like to talk about it? I could really use some womanly advice and just overall support. Every night gets harder and harder. Thanks!  [deleted] [deleted]  I wish I could offer you some advice. What are you having difficulty with? I wasn't with my husband when he was at boot camp, but I imagine it is difficult for you because your fiance isn't able to communicate very often. Remember that it's going to be over soon, and that you are a strong person.

My husband deployed while we were engaged, and it was difficult for me because I missed him and I worried about him. It was also difficult because I could tell he was so unhappy. 
It was definitely harder on him though! I just missed him. He missed me and all of his family and friends, plus he had all the stress and silly bureaucracy of being deployed minus the comforts of home. He called as often as he could and I would try to cheer him up, I sent care packages, and we used a program where I could write e-mails that would be printed out and given to him. So, I would write him daily letters using that. One of the big things that I did during that time was just analyze my problems before bringing them to him. If I had a bad day at work, I would turn it into a funny story instead of burdening him with a bad mood over something that he has no control over. If it was a legitimate concern I would bring it up with him, and we'd figure out how to handle it. Ultimately, his deployment made our relationship stronger as we both became stronger people independently, but also recognized how amazing it is to be able to completely rely on someone else. I hope you have the same experience with your fiance!  Male prior-army here with some personal perspective.

I don't know your fiance` so I can't speak for him, but personally I was less than pleased when a significant other would tell me how hard they had it as it put a lot of additional stress on me. I had a lot of problems while deployed when talking to girlfriends (not multiple at the same time, but several different ones over the course of my time in the military) to have them tell me how tough they had it. This lead to a mix of emotions, on one hand I, on top of all the shit I had to deal with overseas, now had in the back of my mind my girlfriends problems, but I was also pretty mad (like infuriated) about hearing how tough they had it considering the conditions I was living in. Then, on top of all that, I felt as though I couldn't voice any of my own problems back to them as it would just lead to them being more stressed and create some kind of vicious pity-party where all we did was complain to one another.

Write letters to him, keep yourself pre-occupied, get a job if you don't have one or go to school. When you get married, please, for the love of god, don't become one of those military wives who lives vicariously through their husband. Be your own person, you're probably going to spend a lot of time apart from each other while he's in the military, don't spend that time moping around feeling sorry for yourself or complaining that life is too hard.

It only gets harder. If you think it's difficult being separated in basic training wait until you're trying to raise your kid(s) while he's spending 15 months in a war zone, and yes, the Army was doing 15 month deployments while I was in. The lifestyle isn't for everybody, I don't know your relationship but make sure that life is what you want before you get married.  [deleted] I don't cheat. I love my fiancee and have been with him for four years.  [deleted] [deleted] Bitter much? Look at his comment history... figures. Best thing to do is ignore it until the mods come.  Ooh.

I think I've become involved in a an emotional affair with a friend of my in a student group on our college campus.  We've known each other since the start of this school year and have been friendly, but something changed this semester.  Despite him having a girlfriend, we've gotten really flirtatious and are hanging out more often than normal.

Both of us tend to be physically affection (ie: very huggy) with our friends, but I *know* this isn't normal.  It's killing me inside because this is completely unfair to his girlfriend, who is a really nice girl.  Despite this, though, I know I have feelings for him.  

So, wise ladies, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me.  I know I have to tell him that what's going on isn't right, especially because I have feelings for him.  But how can I do it?  Have any of you gone through something like this before?  Tell him exactly that. It isn't right. He has a girlfriend, and you two are getting too close. This isn't fair to anyone involved, and it needs to stop. Now. 

Don't let it become a negotiation. He probably thinks he can have his cake and eat it too, and will try to hang onto that. You need to be firm about your decision. Give it a few weeks to a couple months to cool down - this is where you don't hang out, you don't act like the best of friends, etc. 

If things have calmed down after that, you may be able to stay friends, as long as you keep it platonic.   Tell him that you have feelings for him and so your friendship isn't so innocent and needs to stop... unless he wants to break up with his girlfriend and be with you, which you'd be totally okay with. But you won't maintain a flirtation with a guy in a relationship.  &amp;gt;which you'd be totally okay with

Assuming you would be okay with it. I personally would have doubts about someone willing to do that so readily (who's to say he won't crush on another girl in a few months and dump you?), but he could be a perfectly decent guy caught in an uncomfortable situation. &amp;gt;which you'd be totally okay with

Please.  You're in college, he's not married, you're not exactly a homewrecker here.  The LAST thing she (or anyone) should want in college is a boyfriend who stays only out of obligation.

 As someone who was cheated on, physically and emotionally, it doesn't hurt any less being married or not. 
  
  That being said, I agree with the whole "staying out of obligation" thing, but that should be his decision. If he wants to be with his girlfriend, he should stop emotionally cheating. If he wants to be with OP, he should break up with his girlfriend. It's about respect for both ladies. Please.  You're in college, he's not married, you're not exactly a homewrecker here.

 You have no right to tell anyone what they should or should not want in a relationship. Speak for yourself.  You have no right to tell anyone what they should or should not want in a relationship.

Just have a few questions.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18stnf/worried_about_possibly_being_pregnant_just_have_a/</url><snippet>About a month ago on January 21st, I had sex with my boyfriend. We started off using a condom, but it was too small for him and was hurting him so we continued on without one. He pulled out way before he came and did not cum inside me, however I am not on birth control. Hindsight is 20/20 and I completely regret it, as the worry it has come with is unbearable. We had never had unprotected sex like that before.  Now, a mere 6 hours after we had intercourse I started my full period, right on schedule. My period lasted for about 7 days.
But I'm due to start my period on the 22nd-ish, but my boobs aren't sore like they usually are before I start my period, and I'm starting to worry. I have had an extremely stressful month, lots of bad stuff has happened, so I'm hoping it is just the stress.

Does anyone have any advice on whether it's all in my head or if this could be a real sign?  Most likely in your head. There's always a chance, but with it being a single time, and he pulling out "way before he came", even with the "precum" factor; you worrying is probably throwing your body off. I cannot tell you how many times I've had a girlfriend be late because she was worrying about unprotected sex, freaking out, convincing both me and her she might be pregnant, only to have her period three-to-seven days later than usual.

I dislike how one woman says "I make _all_ decisions regarding my pregnancy." at 2:03. Considering the father will either be there for the child or be landed with crippling child support for the next 20 years if he wasn't emotionally or financially ready, I don't think that's right.  Unfortunately, biology gives men the short stick (no pun intended) that way. Men don't get to make any decisions about a woman's pregnancy unless the woman wants their input.  Once the child is born they share equal responsibility for them for the rest of the child's life. It's wrong for the father to have no say in whether their child is born if the mother simply doesn't want his input. If the father doesn't want the child but the mother does, what gives her the right to have it and then saddle him with debt for the rest of his life? I know, I know, the legal system. Unfortunately, the legal system and biology don't bare you out. She's the one carrying the child, and she didn't get that way on her own. He had a say in having sex. So because he chose to have sex he should take the consequence and have the child. Do you realize that's the same argument pro-life people use against women who want an abortion? It's wrong to use that against women who aren't ready for children and it's wrong to use it against men for the same reason. A human's desire for pleasure does not equal a necessity to rear children. I would say that forcing child support payments and forcing birth are two very different beasts, but this is still a noteworthy comparison. 

I'm assuming your objection to a woman's decision-making in her pregnancy is only with regards to her choice to keep the child, since this is the only way that the male's personal well-being could be affected. Would the ideal situation be to have abortion universally accessible and free, and then make it possible for the male to opt out of involvement with the fetus and it's future once he is notified of pregnancy? I would say ideally that if they had previously agreed to not have children and she later finds herself pregnant that he is only financially responsible for the cost of an abortion. If, conversely, they decide to have the child and later the relationship sowers then he is entitled to visitation rights as long as he is paying child support and does not have a criminal record. Right now, if she even says that he was abusive he can have all visitation rights removed even if there is no evidence to back her claim. To me, that is the most horrific aspect of the legal situation as it stands, though I hadn't made that my clear position before.

I want to thank you for taking the tone of discussion instead of argumentative posturing. This can be a very emotional discussion and I appreciate your tone and comments. &amp;gt; if they had previously agreed to not have children and she later finds herself pregnant that he is only financially responsible for the cost of an abortion.

I don't agree here, birth control is a female's responsibility because they are the ones with the power and agency to make the ultimate choice over whether or not to carry it forward.

It is fine for women to request money from men for abortions but it should be up to them to arrange that and not simply for it to be automatically owed from men. This would be besides the point if we cover abortions with health care though.

One way to handle this is for women to refuse having sex with a man unless he has a monetary deposit which can be withdrawn against when proof of aborting his DNA is given (match of embryo/fetus corpse DNA to his white blood cells). This would not be prostitution because he doesn't pay it outright but rather just has it there as a failsafe if it is needed by someone. It could be a plan covering all comers or it may be something that has to be agreed upon as a potential recipient.

As it is possible to steal sperm men shouldn't automatically be obligated to pay for abortions, though to do so would certainly be the lesser evil compared to obligation to pay for babies, so much so I'm almost willing to embrace that kind of injustice. &amp;gt;As it is possible to steal sperm men shouldn't automatically be obligated to pay for abortions,

I think a rebuttable presumption that the man is liable would be reasonable, since there is no benefit to a woman stealing sperm and then aborting it (although there are a few unhinged people).

That said, I think that abortion should be free at the point of use (and covered on general revenue not health insurance). I would say that forcing child support payments and forcing birth are two very different beasts, but this is still a noteworthy comparison.

It's wrong to use that against women who aren't ready for children and it's wrong to use it against men for the same reason. A human's desire for pleasure does not equal a necessity to rear children. As I've said three times now, unfortunately, biology does not agree with you, neither does the law. I don't know what you mean by biology. If you're just talking about the brief period when the child is in the womb you're right, she has the full burden of taking care of the zygot. 

As far as legality I've already pointed out how unequal the law is. There is a case in court now that they're calling the [Roe V Wade for men](http://www.glennsacks.com/roe_v_wade_men.htm) that is addressing that very inequality. Just because things aren't legally right now law does not mean they are doomed to stay that way.  Nine months is not a brief time. Get a life. The argument is about the choice and responsibility of having a child. Considering the lifelong emotional and financial commitment of that kind of relationship (assuming the mother permits the father to have a relationship with their child) 9 months is a very brief period. 

The woman has complete choice and responsibility while the man has no choice but full responsibility. That you dismiss that so flippantly is disturbing. Nine months is not a brief time. Get a life. As I've said three times now, unfortunately, biology does not agree with you, neither does the law. Unfortunately, the legal system and biology don't bare you out. She's the one carrying the child, and she didn't get that way on her own. He had a say in having sex. I dislike how one woman says "I make _all_ decisions regarding my pregnancy." at 2:03. Considering the father will either be there for the child or be landed with crippling child support for the next 20 years if he wasn't emotionally or financially ready, I don't think that's right.  Condoms=no kids. Simple. Just last night, I went on a blind date and the guy was insane enough to ask for sex without a condom. I was like "really? you want to take the risk of contracting HIV? you barely know me but you trust me enough to not get pregnant?" (It was a deal-breaker)

So, men do have a choice. That choice is to use a condom. It takes two to make a baby, but one person will usually suffer more from those repercussions than the other person. It's usually the woman. That is a very narrow simplification. Out of the 7 billion people on earth there are bound to be some relationships where the women are taking birth control and the men are trusting that to work. They may have talked about what they should do if the BC fails. But no matter what they decided on previously, he has no say in whether or not the woman has their baby. 

The argument is about where the choice and responsibility fall. The way things are, the female gets the choice and responsibility, the male gets no choice but still gets the responsibility. I'm not sure what the practical solution to this issue is. I know that the wrong answer is to take away the female's ability to chose abortion or birth. Beyond interfering with that right, how can we incorporate a male's choice into this in a sensible way? If there were a 99.999% safe and mostly non-traumatic way to transfer the fetus to the father's body, or to an artificial womb (which the father would pay for), then men could have a say.

As it is, women deal with 100% of the risk, 100% the permanent and non-permanent changes to their bodies, and 100% of the say in whether she accepts that or not.  I definitely don't feel that women should be forced to give birth or to have an abortion. But maybe her decision to have a child shouldn't necessitate the forced financial contribution of someone who, let's say, never wanted a child in the first place, and made that intention clear from the get-go. I just think its a grey area that may need addressing If there were a 99.999% safe and mostly non-traumatic way to transfer the fetus to the father's body, or to an artificial womb (which the father would pay for), then men could have a say.

As it is, women deal with 100% of the risk, 100% the permanent and non-permanent changes to their bodies, and 100% of the say in whether she accepts that or not.  Each year 100,000 men are jailed for alleged non-payment of child support, and many others lose their driver&#8217;s licenses, passports and business licenses. This is despite the fact that Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement data reveal that nationwide 70% of those behind on payments earn poverty level wages, and less than 5% earn $40,000 a year. [Source](http://www.glennsacks.com/roe_v_wade_men.htm)

The damages of having a child are not limited to the effects of pregnancy. You do realize that there isn't actually a source for the 100,000 number. 

But that's beside the point. I am all for the concept of legal abandonment, allowing fathers to cut all ties. But that's something to take up with government and legal people. 

It's not a fair system by any means, but it's not a fair situation. It's not fair to make a man pay for a child he doesn't want. It's not fair to make a woman carry (or abort!) a child against her will.

I suppose it comes down to autonomy. Right now, we have the right to bodily autonomy, but not financial. That is a very narrow simplification. Out of the 7 billion people on earth there are bound to be some relationships where the women are taking birth control and the men are trusting that to work. They may have talked about what they should do if the BC fails. But no matter what they decided on previously, he has no say in whether or not the woman has their baby. 

The argument is about where the choice and responsibility fall. The way things are, the female gets the choice and responsibility, the male gets no choice but still gets the responsibility. </snippet></document><document><title>Dress codes for girls: They don&#8217;t teach self-respect.

Now at 24, I have a loving husband but I still struggle daily with my self-image. If I ever have a daughter, I will never make her feel ashamed of herself. One of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard for raising a daughter to love her body is not letting her hear you critique your own. Which made sense, when I thought about it. Picking apart one's own appearance in the mirror is a learned habit&#8212;you hear someone else bemoaning something they hate about themselves, and you think, "Huh. I wonder if my ___ is okay." So you look, and you may decide it's fine, but you may instead decide it's not fine, and a new insecurity is born.

I have my fair share of insecurities (like I truly believe *everyone* does), but if I have a daughter one day, I'm going to try my damndest to never let her hear or see me being negative about myself. Eventually she'll hear/see it from friends and the media, I'm sure, but if I can even delay the onset of that behavior, I will try.

Now at 24, I have a loving husband but I still struggle daily with my self-image. If I ever have a daughter, I will never make her feel ashamed of herself. Just because some mothers use bad excuses to cover up their daughters, doesn't mean that ALL dress codes are slut shaming.  There are legitimate reasons to regulate what people wear.  I love how you are super downvoted for saying that there are non slut-shaming reasons to have dress codes, but then all supporting examples for your argument are well-respected....

 The comment is just in the wrong place.  It looks like the poster is being mean to the woman replied to, downplaying her personal experience, rather than addressing the topic of the article itself.   Just because some mothers use bad excuses to cover up their daughters, doesn't mean that ALL dress codes are slut shaming.  There are legitimate reasons to regulate what people wear.  Like? Schools with no pajamas rules. You're at school to work, not to sleep, and when you eventually have a real job you likely won't be able to wear pajamas there either. The rule helps establish good dressing habits. Jeans &amp;amp; t-shirts aren't acceptable in many jobs, either. :/ Like? Like?  When these topics come up, I think of this charter school in PGH where all the kids had to wear the same uniform: Polo shirt (or button down), navy or black slacks, and/or regulation knee length shorts.  Boys and girls wore the exact same clothes, and there were no arguments about sexuality or gender.  You wore the uniform or you got expelled, no slut shaming required.  Why don't more schools adopt a uni-sex uniform?

*Those knee length shorts were the least flattering thing I've ever seen.  I honestly thought the school could've gotten something a little cuter. I was violently against uniforms when I was a student.  My parents enrolled me in the local Catholic school and I was horrified at having to wear a uniform every day.  I cried when we went to the store to pick up my skirts for the year.  

After enrolling... I became a convert.  No one cared what clothing everyone else was wearing.  Even the wealthiest kids took pride in scavenging the local Goodwill for shirts that matched the skirts.  Some of the boys found it hilarious to wear the same tie every day all year.   No one cared.  It was utter freedom not having to spend hours trying to find an outfit.  My biggest concern was deciding on a pink, yellow, or white button down for the day.  I didn't even bother to iron them most days because, again, no one really cared.  

The only downside was getting back into the "real" world of public university.  I forgot how to dress myself for a bit, because I was unused to being judged by my fashion sense.  I spent more time on my hair and makeup than on my wardrobe.  It was bliss to take a college internship at Disney - back to the uniforms! 

Now that I'm a teacher, I wish my school would institute uniforms.  I hate seeing kids get harassed because of clothing - from both their peers and the adults.

Now that I'm a teacher, I wish my school would institute uniforms.  I hate seeing kids get harassed because of clothing - from both their peers and the adults. The thing I hated about wearing uniforms was that the teachers end up caring more about what the student is wearing than what the student actually learns - I find it hard to believe that the difference between socks that were .5 inches below my ankle and socks that were .5 above my ankle affected my learning in any way shape or form. I find it hard to believe that me shivering in a cold room in January was better for my learning than if I was allowed to wear a sweatshirt or sweater of some sort. 

What I did like about uniforms is that no one ever made fun of my clothes. I honestly don't know what its like to have my clothes made fun of because it never happened to me. I didn't have to think about what I was putting on in the morning because I was putting on my uniform. 

I will agree with you that uniforms did cause me to never really learn how to properly dress myself on a regular basis. It's taken me a while to learn "fashion." Stupid that they didn't have some kind of sweater option for your uniforms. If it makes you feel any better, my high school (which did not have uniforms) made us shiver too. We were not allowed to wear coats during class hours under any circumstances, because Columbine or something, and one year my morning class was in a poorly heated/insulated area of the building. It would regularly be 55F in there. Even the teachers bitched. Sweatshirts didn't cut it, but the administration didn't give a crap. Entrenched bureaucracies are fun for everyone.  Eventually they did allow us to wear some fleece pullover which was nice. Of course the sports teams all got to wear cool hoodies, but the academic clubs/teams did not. When your private school is funded by sports, those who don't play definitely get the short end of the stick. (example: instead of upgrading the VERY outdated science labs, my school decided to spend $1 million on installing all-weather turf on the football field) Eventually they did allow us to wear some fleece pullover which was nice.

It was fabulous.

But yes, I think dress codes are important, and I'm all for uniforms like this.  Its comfortable clothes and it all looks the damn same.  No pressure or distraction from any side.

*Those knee length shorts were the least flattering thing I've ever seen.  I honestly thought the school could've gotten something a little cuter. I think we go about dress code in schools all wrong.  Treat school more like a job. Make school dress code something like business casual. School is suppose to prepare you for the work force to some degree. I know that is similar to what most schools have in place now, but when you work it like business casual or explain you are trying to groom the kids to dress more professionally it just has a different feel.

*Those knee length shorts were the least flattering thing I've ever seen.  I honestly thought the school could've gotten something a little cuter. I went to a school like that. On Fridays girls had to wear the skirts and button ups, but the rest of the week the uniforms for boys and girls were identical. There were arguments about sexuality and gender. All of a sudden, maybe our pants were too tight, or our shirts were too tight. Then they started getting angry if we (as girls) had the audacity to unbutton all 3 buttons on our polo shirts. 

There was also the problem of different brands, and people could still see that and make fun. If you didn't wear dickies, you got made fun of. If you wore pleated pants, jesus, run for cover. So they tried to make us all buy the same brand, but they chose land's end, and land's end was expensive. My family couldn't afford it, so I had 1 pair of pants, 2 polos, and the friday uniform. I got made fun of for that. 

This idea that uniforms solve all these problems is in strict contradiction to what I experienced at a strict uniform school for 13 years. 

Edit: Also, aside from all the gender issues, the faculty and staff spent so much time completely consumed with making sure our shirts were tucked in or that our polos were one of the 3 standard colors, that they totally missed things like 14 year olds smoking meth in the bathrooms.  Those sound like very specific problems with your school rather than with uniforms in general. Better solutions include not allowing brand emblems on polos and that sort of thing. And if they made everyone, boys and girls, button all 3 buttons, why is that bad? Maybe a little irritating, but really, not bad.

And if the teachers aren't focused on uniform compliance, then it's dress code compliance. It's a lot worse for teachers to have to spend their time looking for very low cut shirts, bared midriffs, hanging out underwear, inappropriate racist and sexist slogans on shirts, and the list goes on. Uniforms don't cause that problem; inappropriate dress does. And it makes it easier to call people out without having to shame them about their bodies. Unless you think that that's all appropriate school attire, but really, it's not.

And when my brother's school went to uniforms, he had one polo in each of 3 colors and two pairs of pants, and no one noticed. Not because we didn't have the money, but because there was no point in buying more. Maybe your experience was different, but from the comments here, it sounds less common than the people who no one knew didn't have as many clothes as others.

As someone with a hard-to-fit body, specific requirements due to a medical device that I have to have on my body at all times, and OCD related to the clothing I wear, I'm incredibly glad that my school did not agree with your sentiment.

Schools with uniforms often force students to buy a specific shirt or even an entire specific outfit with few to no alternatives in how those clothing items are cut.  How is it an equalizer if some of the students' bodies fit well in their uniforms and others are left with uncomfortable, ill-fitting clothing or exorbitant tailoring bills?

 Many urban schools offer uniform assistance, as mine did growing up, and it was actually a great thing for those of us that were less fortunate, because no one was judging us by our clothing.

Many urban schools offer uniform assistance, as mine did growing up, and it was actually a great thing for those of us that were less fortunate, because no one was judging us by our clothing. Those are great advantages, although the school subsidizing disadvantaged children is not dependent on a uniform policy, having one in place would probably help to justify it. If angry parents ask why money is going to subsidize other peoples kids, the answer can be 'we are forcing them to buy uniforms they cannot afford'.

But alternatively, the school could be spending the same money they use to subsidize some uniforms on a breakfast club (a stocked food room with toasters etc that anyone can drop into for a bite in the morning). These at least have been demonstrated to improve student grades. * Uniforms are costly, to the school and students, and it affects underprivileged students disproportionately

 &amp;gt;Uniforms are costly, to the school and students, and it affects underprivileged students disproportionately

I'm neither pro- nor anti- uniform, it depends entirely on the rules in a situation, but uniforms are rarely as expensive as you are imagining, and in fact they can act as "equalizers." When everyone is wearing the same clothes, there's no judging somebody for the cost of their clothes (an as somebody who was in high school not THAT long ago, kids DO judge each other for wearing "cheap" brands).

If anything, uniforms can benefit the underprivileged by saving them from discrimination based on their perceived class.

But I'm not okay with dress codes that, for instance, have girls wearing knee-length wool skirts in the spring so they can "learn about modesty and self-respect." Like I said, how I feel about uniforms has everything to do with the details of the respective uniform policies. Knee length? Hah. Meet Rangitoto College, where the [senior girl uniform](http://www.rangitoto.school.nz/services/senior-girls/) is a calf length woolen skirt, throughout the year. No roman sandals either. They had a lovely uniform, which had summer/winter stuff, then changed it to be more like a private school.

I'm so glad I have my uniform (can't find a decent picture), where we have four different shirts (eight technically, as you can wear whatever gender you want and girls do wear guys shirts), a skirt, shorts and long trousers (and you can take any of those up however much you want). Hair, makeup and shoes are unregulated and bags are whatever you want, and you choose your jumper/jacket as long as it's black (there are school ones, but they were overpriced so they stopped making it compulsory). 

I'm a big fan of it, as it's pretty low cost (for about NZ$120 I got my uniform for nearly three years, which is far less than if I had to spend money on it by myself), there's no social stigma and the fact that we can choose our hair/makeup/shoes means that there's not as much pressure on bags - I know at Rangitoto, where bags are just about the only thing students can choose, people look down on you unless you have a Jansport or Country Road bag.

TL;DR: Completely random rant about how I like my uniform, especially as compared to one of my friends school. Your friend's school sounds like the fucking worst. &amp;gt;Uniforms are costly, to the school and students, and it affects underprivileged students disproportionately

My school's gym uniforms was $25 a pop, and given that all my other clothes came from the rest of the family around the US mailing me discarded stuff, it was a huge deal. Even if the shirts are only $8 a shirt and the pants/skirts $15, there are still families where that's a big damn deal.

I get that, but public schools with uniforms would be required to provide free versions, and families in our area who are poor enough get clothing vouchers as it is. And if you only have to buy 3 shirts and two pairs of pants, it's pretty affordable for the school district. And getting hand me downs and free donated gently used options becomes an option after the policy has been in place for a few years and kids that could afford it grow out of their old ones. As long as there's vouchers and discounts, that's great. I really love the idea of uniforms, I just want there to be precautions for the lower-income types, and my area didn't have those. &amp;gt;Uniforms are costly, to the school and students, and it affects underprivileged students disproportionately

If anything, a mostly uniform appearance can highlight the small difference.

I went to a school with uniform (in the UK, it's the norm) and one could clearly still tell who was rich and who was poor - who had designer bags, who had expensive jewellery, who had fancy phones, etc...I think it just removes one of the more obvious pointers of wealth. It's probably easier to notice if someone is wearing scruffy hand-me-down clothes than if someone's stud earrings aren't real gold.My uniform was incredibly expensive - we're talking &#163;25 blouses/button downs, &#163;30 skirts, &#163;20 jumpers, and a mandatory &#163;100 winter coat. Plus the sports wear... However, they did sell second hand clothing given to them by students who had left or lost property that had been left behind. I had one skirt, one coat, two blazers, and three shirts last me the entire five years. In the US, uniforms are popular enough that the standard styles are carried by retailers like Target, Walmart and Old Navy for really inexpensive prices. Public school uniforms are usually something simple, like white polos and navy pants. Parochial school's usually have something more similar to what you wore. Agreed.

 Many of this school clothes are a lot cheaper than what kids are wearing now. I still can't fathom spending more that $15 on jeans.  Nor can I, and to people who get enjoyment and pleasure out of expensive clothes that's fine, but a uniform sets a minimum cost for students. As I pointed out, this doesn't affect the people spending over 15$ on jeans as much as it does the ones getting them for $5 at value village or for free as hand-me-downs. I don't know where your understanding of those in poverty comes from, but coming from my first hand experience, many parents will work extra hours, or extra jobs, to help keep their kids in good clothes. My mom worked three jobs, and we ate from the food shelf, but she still bought me quality clothes and shoes because she didn't want me to have to deal with bullying. Uniforms remove a lot of this pressure.

The only two schools I knew that sold uniforms were charging more than $8 a shirt, but then retail products can be stupid expensive in Canada relative to America (admittedly one was a private school).

Students were generally against uniforms because they wanted more freedom of expression. There was essentially no bullying at the schools I went to based on inferring your social status by your outfit. I got picked on for wearing sweat-pants in grades 4-6 because they were 'kids pants' but that's not a price or brand issue. When I switched to jeans that were just as cheap the bullying stopped.

My parents had more than enough money to buy me expensive brand clothes, they just didn't bother. Why spend money on something I'm going to grow out of and can't even appreciate. I think they would find the concept of parents working overtime to get nice clothes for their children alien.

And it may be a practical solution, but I think it's wrong to prevent bullying by disallowing the behavior that the bullies are discriminating based on. I hated it when schools punished the entire class/grade/student population for the acts of one individual. I guess it's different because the people getting bullied didn't choose to have cheap clothes, so the only ones that get treated unfairly are the ones that wear nice clothes and aren't part of the bullying. Many of this school clothes are a lot cheaper than what kids are wearing now. I still can't fathom spending more that $15 on jeans.  Where are you finding these $15 jeans? * Uniforms are costly, to the school and students, and it affects underprivileged students disproportionately

* It's one more rule to enforce

* There's no scientific evidence of a benefit to education yet

* People see it as unnecessarily heavyhanded

An alternative is adopting a highly specific unisex dress code (or a dresscode with unisex options). For example, require a Polo Shirt but don't sell it as a school uniform.


 [deleted] What if you don't have $100 at that time, though? I absolutely think uniforms are better than no uniforms, but my family's whole budget for my clothes for a *year* growing up was well under $100 because we just couldn't manage more. But wouldn't that means the uniform would be better for you? No one would know you only had 2 pairs of pants and 3 shirts, for example. Assuming polo/khaki dress code, the $8 a shirt and let's say $15 (kohl's price)for pants. $55? If you aren't wearing a uniform, that's not nearly enough.

 When these topics come up, I think of this charter school in PGH where all the kids had to wear the same uniform: Polo shirt (or button down), navy or black slacks, and/or regulation knee length shorts.  Boys and girls wore the exact same clothes, and there were no arguments about sexuality or gender.  You wore the uniform or you got expelled, no slut shaming required.  Why don't more schools adopt a uni-sex uniform?

*Those knee length shorts were the least flattering thing I've ever seen.  I honestly thought the school could've gotten something a little cuter. I think that defeats the whole purpose of article. Also, I would like to point out that 'uni-sex' almost always means women wearing mens' clothing.  So what is "men's clothing" anyway? Are trousers men's clothing? I know far more women dressing in trousers most of the time than I know women dressing in skirts/dresses most of the time. Button down shirts are not exactly male clothing-items either IMHO.  
I don't know if the women around me are just too male, but the only difference around me in clothing is that women tend to wear tighter clothes and prefer other prints on their shirts. As a lady with tits, button down shirts ARE male clothing items. Unless you want to spend a fortune tailoring every single because your chest is a vastly different size than the rest of your body.

But while I don't know if it's what youareaturkey means, as someone who has worked in retail clothing, things labeled "unisex" are sized in men's sizes, and cut on men's pattern. A men's tee shirt and a "unisex" tee shirt will have the same cut, and run on the same sizes. Much like men's and women's shoes are differently sized (in America, at least, a men's 8 is a women's 10), so are the clothes. A men's small is often the size of a women's large or extra-large. It's quite telling that "unisex" sizes are men's sizes. Especially since most "unisex" lines don't carry XS or XXS.

Plus, you can't have unisex pants, because while there are exceptions, men's and women's bodies are shaped very differently in the hips. If the pants are cut high at all (as in, if they are not low-riders sitting on the widest part of the hip), you'll run into significant issues with the waist-hip ratios women have.

Also, fun note, buttons are on different sides for men's and women's clothing, so those can't be unisex either. So what is "men's clothing" anyway? Are trousers men's clothing? I know far more women dressing in trousers most of the time than I know women dressing in skirts/dresses most of the time. Button down shirts are not exactly male clothing-items either IMHO.

Ultimately, in my experience, the dress code ended up being about body policing more than anything else. We had "no cleavage" rules, and used the arm length/shorts rule. Skinny, pretty girls wore short shorts and skirts and no one said a word. Girls with smallish breasts wore whatever shirts they wanted. But girls that were bigger chested got called out for damn near any shirt that didn't go up to their neck. Girls with short arms could have their ass hang out if they wanted (which no one did) but girls with long arms were subject to totally different standards. I got called out for shorts semi-frequently with the dress code, shorts that looked perfectly fine, but could get away with shirts that damn near showed my bra cups if I wanted. It was enforced in a weird, mish mash way, with rules that were based on our bodies, not on any kind of objective measure.

The dress codes in the Army didn't teach me self-respect, but they did teach me socially acceptable dress standards which have earned me respect from others (once I figured it out and began implementing them as a civilian). 

Sometimes it's not about how you feel about yourself. Sometimes it's about how others perceive you and how you can use that to your advantage in managing their first impression of you.  can you elaborate?   In the buisness world there are formal and informal dress codes which are used to convey information. I don't mean secret messages like "Blue is for loyalty to Cisco and red is for loyalty to Foundry", or anything crazy like that, although corporate polo shirts come close. But stated and unstated dress codes exist. 

In the average cube-farm workplace you can usually tell who's what by their clothing: Engineers can get away with jeans, khakis, plaid, whatever, because for the most part they're dealing with other engineers and equipment, and the occasional managerial "translator" who takes what they made and brings it to the customer. Managers wear clothing as a language: suit and tie, dress shirt and sweater, jacket and pumps. That clothing says "I'm socially conscious enough to have a solid grasp of what image the company wants portrayed and self-aware enough to construct my own version of this image." Janitors wear the minimum level of formalwear they can get away with for the job, depending on the dress codes for the building. Shiftworkers - well. I've seen pajamas and slippers. But nobody talks to shiftworkers in person.  

Each level of clothing comes with its own level of technical care required for that clothing. At the bottom, T-shirts and jeans are wash n wear; at the top, suits require professional cleaning, irons, starch, polish for the shoes, etc. It's an investment in time and effort, more and more time and effort as you go up the ladder of corporate responsibility. This is partly the whole point of the suit, by the way; a display of the effort you're willing to invest in your appearance. A display that you're willing to invest that time and effort in the first place showing that you value and respect 1) appearance and 2) the opinions of others and 3) the company itself. 

In the military, coming from all sorts of backgrounds, from the backwoods to the slums to everything else - some folks never learn what's acceptable buisness attire, formal wear, etc. People coming in at 18 don't always know about the stuff above. And some people just never paid attention and thought they's spend their whole lives in jeans and sweats. So a lot of people come in and have to learn about formal clothing as a language as though it were a *foreign* language. 

So you sign up, you get issued clothes for work and clothes for formal occasions and you learn about mess dress and dress greens and dress whites and all sorts of levels of formality, and what's acceptable, and you learn how to take care of your clothes, how to wear your medals, and how to put them on and appear neat and tidy so you're not out of place in a formal situation. You learn how to wear a fitted jacket, a necktie, all sorts of bits and pieces and components that go into putting together a package appearance. Weather you choose to use this information alter in life is your decision, but it's something you learn so you can look presentable for the military.  You have no idea how much time military kids spend learning and practicing nothing more than how to get dressed and wear clothes. It's crazy. But tactically speaking, it works - military clothing is as much of a weapon as guns. A sharp appearance influences troop morale. Sharp-looking units make good poster images for funding requests. It makes so much of a difference that they spend rather a lot of time on it in basic and advanced training; not as much as on guns, but way more than your average civilian would ever imagine. 

And then you leave the military where they tell you what to wear, and you have to look at civilian clothing standards, and you start seeing that civilian clothing standards are in a lot of ways *really* similar to military ones. A buisness office? You already know how to wear a belt with trousers, how to polish your shoes, how the pants should hang, how to put up a conservative and tidy hairstyle. You can, if you so choose, blend. Impress, even.  

It might be shallow of some folks - managerial folks - to take some clothing more seriously, but there are millions of them and only one fo you, and you don't control their prejudices any more than they control yours. You'll never convince them their language is wrong; it works for them. Whether you buy into it or not, you *can* use that prejudice and that language to your advantage. Wearing the "corporate uniform" tells them you respect their company and the customers you're dealing with, and won't embarrass them. In some places you can get away with wearing other stuff if you're good at your job - but it will waste your time and theirs when you have to prove your worth every time you talk to a new person in the office because you didn't think to engineer the "shortcut" of the appropriate clothing into your meeting considerations. 

(Yes, you can also use clothing as camouflage, to hack social networks and lie and scam folks. A sharp suit and confident smile is a terrible reason for anyone to trust you. But our species is visual. Look at how large a space our brains devote to processing visual stimulus! It's what we are, and most people don't even think about this stuff - they just live it.) 

Caveat: All of this presupposes you don't work for Google, which is mostly a company of engineers, so they wear whatever they want internally. Bet you their division that deals with the external world wears some sharp suits, though. 


edit: holy crap. Gold? Wow. Thank you!  I really see your point on this. It's why I will ALWAYS wear formal clothing to an interview, even if it isn't stated to be a formal interview or is just for a job in a shop, etc. People see you have put an effort in and if everyone else is wearing jeans, you simply look more professional. I'm sure it's faired me well in interviews before. Yeah. If someone can't be bothered to dress nicely for an interview, how much can they possibly care about the job? (Yes, there are genius exceptions. That's why interviewers ask questions too. But clothing is a good way to weed out people who quite literally can't manage to dress themselves appropriately in the morning.)  Counterpoint: I would never work for a place that rejected me based on what I wore to the interview.

EDIT: Wow, the privilege in that sentence I just wrote. Obviously if I were jobless and needed to find one badly I would deign to suit up, but as I am now, I realize I am deeply fortunate to be in a position where I could express the above opinion.

edit: holy crap. Gold? Wow. Thank you!  I'd never thought about the corporate dress code in that more generous/positive light. I'd always done the bare minimum and abhorred it all as shallow.

edit: holy crap. Gold? Wow. Thank you!  using clothing as a tool - I like it *Everything* is a tool.

edit: holy crap. Gold? Wow. Thank you!  This is a wonderfully written piece. Thank you for explaining it so well!  I really think the author of this article is either reading way too much into this or just taking what she wants from it anyway.  My high school, which was a middle/high school, had a dress code, that applied equally to boys and girls, except for skirts - There were only rules for those for the girls, though I suspect if any guy had tried it, they would have been enforced.

* Any tank tops had to follow the "three-finger" rule.
* No hats or sunglasses
* Skirts and shorts had to be past the fingertips
* No explicit/profane/suggestive shirts (This included one that said "Dallas sucks, TO swallows, worn by a guy)
* There was something about handkerchiefs... Not sure what.

But that was pretty much it, as far as I can remember... I would agree with the sentiment that dress codes represent a minimum standard of professionalism.
 This. This whole argument is ridiculous. Enforcing dress standards in schools isn't slut shaming. 

There is a time and a place for things like mini skirts and tube tops, and school isn't one of them. Enforcing a standard of professionalism in an environment where the expectation is getting work done, not having fun, is not wrong.

Thats my thought at least.      I think this article is making logical leaps and bounds away from the point of dress codes. You are at school. School is not the place to be showing off your body, male or female. You wouldn't go to work dressed inappropriately, and you shouldn't go to school that way either. It's about professionalism, not slut shaming. 

For grown men and women, I believe it is much easier to ignore tight fitting and/or revealing clothes. For middle/high schoolers it is much, much harder. It does become distracting for them when a boy wears a wife beater or a girl wears a very short skirt. 

I don't care what the kids wear outside of school, but in school they need to be dressing more modestly then they maybe would like.  I agree.  I think some teachers and administration take liberties in how they enforce dress codes, like telling a girl to have some respect for herself when in reality it is about having respect for the school environment.  But overall that isn't what it is about.  It is about creating a safe, respectful, and rigorous educational atmosphere.

And we have to be realistic about the brains of teenage girls and boys.  Their hormones are going crazy, they are super honed in on the opposite sex... so yes, revealing clothing is distracting to both sexes, and regardless of that, it just doesn't belong in a learning environment. I think this article is making logical leaps and bounds away from the point of dress codes. You are at school. School is not the place to be showing off your body, male or female.

I don't care what the kids wear outside of school, but in school they need to be dressing more modestly then they maybe would like.     I went to a school with a uniform code. The uniforms were skirts bellow the knee, polos and ankle socks. I never felt ashamed of my body just because it was expected of me to dress in a certain way to go to school. I seriously don't understand how having a dress code = making women feel ashamed of themselves. The author isn't saying that having a dress code makes women feel ashamed of themselves. She's saying that having a dress code doesn't mean that girls will dress modestly and thus respect themselves. There isn't a correlation between a dress code and self-respect. Girls have to be taught to value themselves by being valued, and seeing other positive examples of women doing so. I went to a school with a uniform code.

Ms. Lahey endorses dress codes not to regulate the behavior of boys, but to teach girls to not objectify themselves as sex objects.  I know that some girls like to dress in revealing clothes "for themselves" but it's very clear that a lot of girls wear revealing clothes in middle school for attention from boys.  That's a fact and if you deny that fact I would have to conclude you are being disingenuous.  And that young age, girls should be taught that they should demand to be respected for who they are, and not for the way they look.  

And this argument that girls shouldn't be "slut shamed" in school is idiotic.  No matter how "pro-sex" you are, there are some places where sexually revealing clothing is inappropriate - and SCHOOL is one of those places, especially at an age where most girls and boys are still figuring out their sexuality and identity.  Do people that consider dress codes slut shaming also think that girls and boys should be able to go to school topless?  What about with their genitals out?   There's a huge difference between applying an overly strict dress code to girls (and only girls, by the way) and saying "everyone gets to go pantsless!" It's my opinion that girls should also be taught that how they look doesn't cancel out who they are- that you can wear a tank top an still be smart and creative and valuable as a person.  I totally disagree. Boys have a dress code too: no gang colors, no sagging, no underwear showing, no undergarments showing, no flip flops, ect. In my opinion the dress code for both sexes is a minimum standard of professionalism. Both genders are going there to learn not to make a fashion statement. &amp;gt;Both genders are going there to learn not to make a fashion statement.

To be totally fair, it's possible to do both at once. Many students at my school did so. I totally disagree. Boys have a dress code too: no gang colors, no sagging, no underwear showing, no undergarments showing, no flip flops, ect. In my opinion the dress code for both sexes is a minimum standard of professionalism. Both genders are going there to learn not to make a fashion statement. &amp;gt;no gang colors, no sagging, no underwear showing, no undergarments showing, no flip flops, ect

Do these rules not also apply to the girls, plus many many more? &amp;gt;no gang colors, no sagging, no underwear showing, no undergarments showing, no flip flops, ect

Do these rules not also apply to the girls, plus many many more? Well don't all the rules applied to the girls also apply to the boys. No spaghetti straps, short skirts, midsection showing.

Edit: originally said boys to boys, changed to girls to boys. There's a huge difference between applying an overly strict dress code to girls (and only girls, by the way) and saying "everyone gets to go pantsless!" It's my opinion that girls should also be taught that how they look doesn't cancel out who they are- that you can wear a tank top an still be smart and creative and valuable as a person.

Well where do you draw the line?  That's a subjective question with no real answer, but schools purposely try to draw the line more conservatively than less conservatively, to stay on the line of less sexualization rather than more.  Also, this article said nothing about tank tops - it's talking about short skirts, which are clearly a different story. 

Also why do you say that the dress code applies only to girl?  What are boys allowed to wear that girls can't?  If everything's covered, for one. That's a good start. And both tank tops and short skirts are things that have perceived decency that is directly affected by a girl growing up.

Besides the fact that the original article was only about girls, you mean? Sorry if I was unclear. &amp;gt; If everything's covered, for one. That's a good start. And both tank tops and short skirts are things that have perceived decency that is directly affected by a girl growing up.

What?  The author of this piece is completely missing the point of Jessica Lahey's article.

Do people that consider dress codes slut shaming also think that girls and boys should be able to go to school topless?  What about with their genitals out?   Objectify themselves? No. You do not objectify *yourself*. People objectify *you*. Wearing revealing clothing only becomes objectifying *when people reduce you to an object*. It's an *external* action. But what about when people wear clothes with the intention of grabbing attention? Most of the girls I know wear push-up bras and cleavage so that they can have more male attention. I'd say they're objectifying themselves.

While a lot of women wear makeup and revealing and flashy outfits because they like looking like that (hey, I love how I look with red lipstick and heels), a lot of the time they're dolling themselves up so that others can perceive them as sexy, hot or simply to grab attention. I wear push-up bras because they offer better support. Not that it should matter because being sexual does not invalidate you as a human being and make you unworthy of respect.

NONETHELESS, that people choose to *objectify* you is THEIR prerogative, not yours. You realize that "express sexuality" and "objectify" are two vastly different things, right? Good for you, I find them rather uncomfortable and I personally prefer to use wireless bras or not a bra at all.

I understand your point, I never said that being sexual invalidates you or makes you unworthy or respect. But I guess that is a common meme presented when somebody suggests that *gasp* people judge you for what you wear.

Live you life, wear what you like... But wouldn't it be foolish to complain that you're being judged as being a sexual being when you're expressing your sexuality?

You are projecting your own judgements as truth. My judgements are based on experience and conversations with girls. In middle school and high school I would hear my friends saying how they would hem their skirts so that they were shorter and they would look pretty to the boys, I would hear them discussing how they would wear makeup and do their hair cause their crush would be nicer to them.

In college the seldom times I go out with my friends (or acquaintances) sometimes we all change together, they wear push-up bras so that they can get drinks for free or they have to make no line to go to the club. They wear heels cause they want for their legs to look "sexy" and they wear makeup because more guys will talk to them.

I am not making any of this up, this is all from conversations with them. My judgements are based on experience and conversations with girls.

Do people that consider dress codes slut shaming also think that girls and boys should be able to go to school topless?  What about with their genitals out?   I think you are missing the point. The base problem is the hyper-sexualization of woman's bodies. A woman is not being sexually inappropriate when she bares her shoulders or her legs. Because women are often reduced to the value of their bodies as objects, people like to blame women who dress "slutty". But there is a serious gender based double standard.  How many boys are told they are dressing slutty? How many boys are ever called slutty?  

I also question that most middle-school girls are wearing revealing clothing to get attention from boys. They are wearing revealing clothing because it's what is offered to them. Have you been to an Abercrombie or Hollister lately? The trendy clothes are revealing, so that is what girls are wearing.  What are you talking about? 

Nobody is blaming women for anything.  This has nothing to do with slut shaming.  This is about creating an environment where girls do not feel pressured to wear revealing clothes to attract boys.  Did you ever go to Middle School?  There is A LOT of pressure on girls to "put out," look a certain way, act a certain.  There is pressure on boys too, but the pressure on boys is different - to act super macho, to wear the coolest clothes, etc...  Middle and High school are absolutely  horrible and a TON of people are scarred for life because of the ridicule, the bullying, the peer pressure, the judgment, etc... 

Your excuse for girls wearing revealing clothes - "it's what's offered to them" is bullshit.  If our society only sells revealing clothes to girls, we should fight that rather than just accept it.  I am sure that girls can find clothes that cover themselves if they really tried, and its the school's responsibility to not let the media's negative images of how boys and girls should act and dress infect the learning environment. 

And your point of "hypersexualization" of girl's bodies is nonsense too.  Yes, a girl's body can be viewed neutrally, but it can also be viewed sexually and for that reason - we should keep the sexual aspect out of it as much as we can.  Its not a societal norm for boys to come to school flaunting their physical sexuality, but if they did, the school would have to stop that too.  Exactly. People seem to think that it's a perfect world and that all girls dress revealing *for themselves*. While I'm sure many late teenagers/adult women do (and they should not be judged for that), girls in middle school and most of high school haven't even established an identity for themselves and are more concerned with fitting in rather than how they want to dress (source: I was in middle school five years ago). In their minds, they find a positive correlation between the shorter length of their skirts and the attention they receive from boys/popularity they have. They have to realize that they don't have to dress in a way they don't want to in order to gain attention from boys and be popular. I made it through middle school without dressing revealing, but that was *my* decision (of course I lost popularity, but I didn't care) because I didn't feel comfortable dressing that way. 

Also, school is meant to prepare students for the workplace - like school, you can't just expect to go to work in a mini skirt and expect everything to go over smoothly.

 Wait, so girls can't make the decision to dress "revealingly" because they don't know themselves yet and have no identity, but *you* were able to make a decision that was yours to not dress revealingly?

 From the article- "Telling women to cover it up is just as surely a form of sexual objectification as telling women to take it off. Either way, you're reducing a woman to her sexuality instead of considering her as a whole person. Either way, you are, to quote Maya Dusenbery of Feministing, "looking at a woman and instead of seeing a full, complex, and multifaceted human being, all you see is ALL TEH SEXXX." What are you talking about?

I actually went to a rather radical middle school and high school. Neither had a dress code. Instead, our schools fostered a spirit of mutual respect. It wasn't okay to comment on someone else's body. We even had sex-ed that taught us having sex was healthy, natural, and even fun. And we, both boys and girls, were taught to make decisions that were best for our own physical, and emotional health.  
  
I believe that the justification that people have used throughout history to cover up women. I believe in justice and equality, so I don't believe it's okay to make women believe that their bodies are shameful. By your reasoning, breast-feeding is a vulgar act because breasts can be viewed sexually! Ankles and wrists can be a turn on, so women should wear burqas.  You're really taking this a lot farther than she meant. If our society sexualizes it, then a class isn't going to fix how sexually the students see themselves or each other in the clothes. You can't just undo years of social conditioning that easily, and you could find yourself sacrificing your learning environment to teach it, which just isn't doable if the parents aren't supportive of education in general anyway.

So I'm assuming you went to a private school or a wealthy public school of some sort, because here's what happened where I'm from when the dress code wasn't being enforced:

* Confederate flags on everything. And I mean everything.

* Butts and thongs hanging out of skirts and shorts and pants.

* Boobs everywhere. Lots of visible bras.

* Guys' underwear hanging out (late 2010s so the oversized gangster pants weren't quite gone yet).

* Offensive/sexist/racist slogans on t-shirts.

* The one girl who wore pants with holes in the butt and no underwear. 

That attire would be distracting for anyone, whether they were sexually attracted to the people wearing the clothing or not. And the pressure to wear more and more sexually revealing clothing was ridiculous in that environment. So when we got a new principal and the dress code was enforced, it was nice because there was less pressure, at least at school, to dress a certain way if you wanted attention. I wouldn't say it raised self esteem, but it did create a more focused learning environment.

If you lived in an area where every parent whose kid went to school made sure that their kid knew what was appropriate attire for school vs home vs parties, then you wouldn't need a dress code. But the reality is that when you have very uninvolved parents, dress codes are really necessary.

And honestly, I fully support public schools going to uniforms (consisting of a polo/sweater and jeans/khakis and tennis shoes/flats of any kind) because it takes all the pressure off the kids to be sexual for attention while they're at school, which doesn't build self-esteem but does make for better learning environments with fewer distractions and disruptions. And they're a safety issue, too, at least in our area where a school stabbing or (individual level) shooting or less violent but still disruptive vandalism or other really disruptive behavior happens every few years and it's almost always done by a kid from another school that someone let in because they thought they were a student. If you can tell which kids are your students and which aren't, you keep that from happening at school as often. No, I went to a charter school in a major urban area, actually.  

I support uniforms, mostly because I grew up pretty poor, but my school had uniforms, so I never got teased about my clothes by other kids. I think they are very helpful. And honestly, it made getting dressed for school so much less stressful. Yes, you're right, repression always works as a method of social change.

"Repression" is only bad when you are repressing a natural urge, but wearing revealing clothes to middle school is not a "natural urge."  It is a socially constructed concept that girls need to look a certain way to get attention from boys.  It's ok to repress that.

What does any of that have to do with this article?  Are you trying to say that telling girls to not dress revealing in school is "anti-sex"?  Even if it was, don't you think that a math class is the one place that should be anti-sex? 

&amp;gt; I believe that the justification that people have used throughout history to cover up women.

So because people in the past used bad justifications to make women cover up, now middle schools shouldn't have dress codes?  Where do you make that logical jump?  

Are you ok with restaurants having dress codes?  How about funerals?  

&amp;gt; I believe in justice and equality, so I don't believe it's okay to make women believe that their bodies are shameful.

Who said that their bodies were shameful?  Your'e acting like the people who are making them cover up are hardcore Christians and they are justifying this rule by acting like God wants it.  It's not because of God at all - it's about making middle school a safe space where sexualization is not welcome. 

&amp;gt; By your reasoning, breast-feeding is a vulgar act because breasts can be viewed sexually!

It's certain inappropraite to breast feed in certain places, such as, for example, a middle school classroom.  I mean, do you think it shoudl be ok for boys to come to school with their dicks out? 

&amp;gt; Ankles and wrists can be a turn on, so women should wear burqas.

Once again you are completely missing the point.  This isn't about what turns boys on, this is about removing pressure from girls to conform to a certain ideal of what a girl should look like in middle school.  The author of this piece is completely missing the point of Jessica Lahey's article.  Ms. Lahey endorses dress codes not to regulate the behavior of boys, but to teach girls to not objectify themselves as sex objects.  I know that some girls like to dress in revealing clothes "for themselves" but it's very clear that a lot of girls wear revealing clothes in middle school for attention from boys.  That's a fact and if you deny that fact I would have to conclude you are being disingenuous.  And that young age, girls should be taught that they should demand to be respected for who they are, and not for the way they look.  

And this argument that girls shouldn't be "slut shamed" in school is idiotic.  No matter how "pro-sex" you are, there are some places where sexually revealing clothing is inappropriate - and SCHOOL is one of those places, especially at an age where most girls and boys are still figuring out their sexuality and identity.  Do people that consider dress codes slut shaming also think that girls and boys should be able to go to school topless?  What about with their genitals out?   One thing that's really tricky about dress codes is that people have different bodies. An outfit that looks fine on one person could be considered revealing on someone with big breasts or long legs, even if the latter students have no intention of showing off to anyone. In this case you're basically punishing a student for looking different, which is something that teenagers do often enough to each other; they shouldn't have to get this shit from faculty as well. 

Learning how to dress appropriately for work and school is important, but if the faculty are quibbling over outfits that "looked fine in the car" then they need a better dress code. Sticking with a unisex dress code of slacks and a polo would make life easier for everyone.  The author of this piece is completely missing the point of Jessica Lahey's article.

I know that some girls like to dress in revealing clothes "for themselves" but it's very clear that a lot of girls wear revealing clothes in middle school for attention from boys.  That's a fact and if you deny that fact I would have to conclude you are being disingenuous.  And that young age, girls should be taught that they should demand to be respected for who they are, and not for the way they look.  

And this argument that girls shouldn't be "slut shamed" in school is idiotic.  No matter how "pro-sex" you are, there are some places where sexually revealing clothing is inappropriate - and SCHOOL is one of those places, especially at an age where most girls and boys are still figuring out their sexuality and identity.  Do people that consider dress codes slut shaming also think that girls and boys should be able to go to school topless?  What about with their genitals out?                 </snippet></document><document><title>Some questions for moms, especially single moms.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18r65i/some_questions_for_moms_especially_single_moms/</url><snippet>I'm a guy who is spending a lot of time with a single mom.  The problem is, I have no idea how to be around the kids.  They absolutely love me, because their biological father was not a great dad or husband.  What type of fun things can I do to keep them entertained?  She absolutely loves that I play with them to let her have some quiet time, or help them with their homework so they aren't fighting or on bugging each other during homework time.  I'm not trying to win them over, or impress her, I'm just trying to be a great substitute dad type.  Please help!  I think it's really awesome that you want to get to know these kids! 

But... I'm assuming that you and their mom are starting/in a relationship? I can't think of a better way to say this, so I'll just blurt it out: Only get involved with her children if you see a real, long-term potential relationship with the mother - even if my assumption is incorrect and the relationship between you and the mom is purely platonic. Kids are really innocent like that, you know, cuz they're kids... they're eager to please and generous with their hearts. You sound like a really nice guy and I'll bet the kids want to build a relationship with you. It's only natural they want to get to know you better by spending time with you.

Please tread carefully. Thanks for the great input.  I keep getting told by people that guys who hang around single moms usually just want one thing from them, and then to move on to another.  I'm not those guys.  I wouldn't have gone to meet them if I didn't think a really long time about what you talk about in your post.  I actually wish I could upvote you twice :-) Ah ha! I was correct! You *are* a nice guy, and you're doing it right!

Good luck :) Actually, I'm a guy that's really scared out of my mind that I'll do the wrong thing, so that's why I'm here to ask so many questions, because I want to prevent that from happening.  Thanks for all the input. I'll be honest - that told me everything. Your concern for your lady friend's feelings and her kids' feelings is all you need. You're trying your best and that's what's important! :) I think it's really awesome that you want to get to know these kids!

This.  A million times, this.  OP, I'm honestly really troubled by the way you say that you're trying to "be a great substitute dad type" while describing your relationship in very casual terms ("spending a lot of time with a single mom").  You shouldn't be a "substitute dad" unless you're planning to marry mom.    How old are they?    How old are they? That may be useful to get best activities to do.  
I used to babysit and I found that most of the time, children know what they want to do and will tell you, if you give them the space to do so. If they are shy or can't make up their minds, my favourite activities to do with them are:  
- Cooking. There are a lot of easy and fun recipes. Even if they are too young and you don't want them to use the oven, you can find appropiate recipes. My personal favourites are hand cookies - outline their little hands on cookie dough. Sushi is also great for cooking with older children (it takes patience though, but it's worth at dinner time). Always clean up after yourselves!!  
- Google some science experiments or projects suitable for children. [This](http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/experiments.html) website has a lot of them. Kids I take care of seem to really enjoy [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0TcMoLVY3A)  
- You'll be amazed at how much you'll enjoy kids board games, and how much time kids can play the ones they like without getting bored. If you like chess, teach them!  
- Google a few easy magic tricks and teach them. Bonus: make a little show for their mother.  
- Get a plain white t-shirt in their size and some paint, let them decorate it. (Cover the floor with newspaper first!!) How old are they? That may be useful to get best activities to do.

I used 2% milk and maybe thats why it doesn't really move when I add the soap?  Mine looked just like the one you linked, the drops moved a tiny bit in the first half second and then nothing else happened.  Some of the related videos, the colors really flow a lot.  Hide and seek, Uno, drawing/coloring, ISpy, Tag, Charades, or even reading to them ... I'm a single mom and a nanny. These things are usually pretty good at keeping them entertained. My daughter and the girl I nanny are around the same age as your GF's kids and we have fun =)  Any idea for books that are both age appropriate and not scary?  She doesn't want them being exposed to things that may be scary.  I was thinking of reading the older one a "choose your own adventure" type book, but the only ones I remember from being a kid were in spooky houses or have some paths through them where you end up getting killed. Dr. Seuss is always a good start, or any Shel Silverstein. Shel Silverstein has some awesome collections and my daughter is a big fan. A good idea (if it's an option) would be to take them to the library and let them pick out what they would like. You can scan it before checking it out to make sure there's nothing inappropriate.  Thanks for the reading ideas.  Never heard of Shel Silverstein myself.  I'll give them a look. Any idea for books that are both age appropriate and not scary?

You could always take a trip to toys r us for some playdough or legos. 

On a less lighthearted note, be careful taking on the role of substitute dad. There have been a few recent cases where substitute dad types were on the hook for child support.   </snippet></document><document><title>In dire need of a hug and some advice. I hope I handled this decently...</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18r54d/in_dire_need_of_a_hug_and_some_advice_i_hope_i/</url><snippet>Hurt and confused and could really just use a hug and some kind words right now. My head is spinning and I&#8217;m not sure what to do TwoX.

I know my current boyfriend still speaks with his ex. I know they hang out on occasion. They had a dog together and he still wants to see it, plus he&#8217;s been a part of her life for the last five years, and a part of her daughters&#8217; lives (they aren&#8217;t his kids; they are from her previous marriage.) That isn&#8217;t the part that bothers me.

What bothers me is that I&#8217;m finding bits of her clothing around his house. Nothing scandalous like panties or a bra or anything, but a scarf here, or a zip-up there. I found the zip-up last night while he was sleeping. I wasn&#8217;t digging around; I was just watching a movie while he took a nap and found it on the couch. I waited until he woke up to ask him about it, because I didn&#8217;t want to just make assumptions and accuse him of anything. I feel like I handled it decently until the conversation itself.

I let him wake up and asked if it was hers, he said yes, and explained the situation. I told him I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore, that I can&#8217;t take her leaving things in his house. I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s doing it on purpose, or if she&#8217;s really just that forgetful (and in all honesty, what girl is going to just &#8216;forget&#8217; a Louis Vuitton scarf in her ex&#8217;s house?)

I love him more than anything. This man has helped me through some really tough times and has been there for me. I do not think he&#8217;s cheating, nor do I think he ever would. That&#8217;s not the case I&#8217;m venting about. I told him he needs to talk to her, to make her stop, or to cut out the ability for her to leave things behind. I don&#8217;t want him to just cut her out completely, because of the dog and the girls, but I can&#8217;t take this anymore, I can&#8217;t take the emotional stress of knowing that she is leaving things behind. What&#8217;s going to happen when we live together? Is she going to be in MY home? Leaving things behind on MY couches?

I just want to curl up in a ball and cry right now. I know he feels horrible about it, and I know he will talk to her (because I told him if he doesn&#8217;t, I will.) I just need some advice, and a hug TwoX, and you guys are amazing.
  There are many ways to effectively handle this situation, and it sounds like you are certainly intuitive and mature enough to know where to go from here. It will take some discussing with him to find out just what his intentions are, there's no way around that.


Understandably, it sounds like your emotions are overwhelming you and that may affect how this pans out. Each time you would confront him, I would approach him calmly and remain as rational as possible, even if he gets defensive or upset. Remind him that you're not there to point fingers, you just want to find out what's going on.  

Above all else, please remember this: you  *absolutely deserve* to be in a relationship that makes you happy. I can definitely understand your reluctancy to leave if it turns out he is cheating on you, or conspiring to cheat. I'm not saying it's impossible to forgive someone who's cheated. There's a distinct difference between being a forgiving girlfriend, however, and just flat out enabling his behavior and becoming a doormat. Decide now where you'll draw the line, and don't budge if he doesn't meet that criteria. 


I hope things work out, dear. Feel free to PM if you need a sympathetic ear. What makes me hope that this will turn out for the best is the fact that he wasn't defensive or upset when I originally confronted him about this. He was immediately apologetic and told me he would talk to her today (which he is, and will update me on what happens.)

Not once did he raise his voice, get upset, or tell me I was imagining things. He told me he understands why I am upset and frustrated, and he's also letting me take time to think about what I want to do. I really don't think I can make a decision until I know how his conversation with her goes today.

Thank you very much for your help. I've been in a similar situation. Just because he isn't upset doesn't necessarily mean he's not guilty, but I think you understand that. It seems likely that, if this does become an issue, he will probably want to work things out, but that's solely my opinion.


Is there any animosity between you and his ex?  I've never met her, so there is none from my end of the spectrum. I have no reason to dislike this woman because I don't know her. She is the type of woman who will drunk-dial him at three in the morning and he refuses to answer those calls.

Edit: I realize that statement makes it look like I have animosity towards her, and I suppose I actually do, seeing as how frustrated I get with her behavior towards him in general. I feel that its inappropriate. Christ. Well, it might be that she sort of enjoys leaving her things around the house? Maybe as a jab at you? One-sided animosity is certainly petty, but that might explain why he's apologetic and nice about it.  That's why I want him to talk to her. To find out if she's doing this to purposely stress out the new girlfriend or if she's just forgetful. Either way, I flat out told him I want this to stop, because its upsetting and unfair to me. That's fair. It seems like you guys are openly communicating, and personally I think you've handled things really well thus far. I know this kind of thing can be upsetting, but try not to let it bring you down too much. Thank you so much for your support. Its one of those things where I feel like life is snow-balling on me with one thing happening after another plus being sick on top of it all. Thank you so much (again) for your support. :) I've never met her, so there is none from my end of the spectrum. I have no reason to dislike this woman because I don't know her.

Edit: I realize that statement makes it look like I have animosity towards her, and I suppose I actually do, seeing as how frustrated I get with her behavior towards him in general. I feel that its inappropriate. Why haven't you two been introduced?   If they're staying friends, and he's serious about keeping you as part of his life, everyone needs to meet at least a few times so that mutual respect is assured.     You've done 90% of the work by communicating with him, and it sounds like you have good instincts. So rather than advice (there are already some helpful comments in the thread,) I just want to give you a quick reminder that you are entitled to your feelings. You are not jumping to conclusions, which is REALLY COOL of you. You're not accusing him of anything. But this is a trigger for you and that is ALLOWED. He sounds really reasonable and I'm sure you'll find a solution together. Just don't bully yourself, this is a normal reaction and you are allowed to be human.  Thank you so much for the affirmations. Sometimes you just need to hear that what you are doing is the right thing...  I don't know how you do it.  

Several years back I was involved with a man who I had known for years, I knew his ex girlfriend fairly well and I knew intimately how it had ended between them.  It had been about a year since they split up and things naturally progressed for us.  We were trying to make it work long distance, he was a state over for school.  We used Skype and talked every night so it was mostly working out just fine.  But then I realized that every time he was going to hang out with his friends, that included her.  All the pictures of him tagged on facebook had her in them.  She had moved on, but was still around all the time, their circle of friends was one and the same so they just kept on hanging out I guess.  She went so far as to try and add me on Facebook once she knew we were together.  When we'd skype I would see the paintings she had made for him still hung on the wall and once while chatting he panned out and I could see her on another couch playing with his cat while another friend sat on the floor.

Waaaaaayyyy too much for me to deal with.  They never got back together or anything and still to this day hang out, but knowing she was his first love for like 4 years and they still had regular contact made me so jealous and insecure I couldn't deal.  I let him go.

I think honestly if it's over, it need to just be over.  They're not his kids and he can get a new dog.  I know that sounds insensitive but it's the truth.  How can SHE ever move on if she's got her ex still around her kids and her dog.  Sounds like he still fits perfectly into her life.  The one out of place here seems to be you.  :( </snippet></document><document><title>UPDATE: "I Have a Big Decision to Make by May"</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18sdoj/update_i_have_a_big_decision_to_make_by_may/</url><snippet>An update to my [original post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17gazr/i_have_a_big_decision_to_make_by_may/).

We've been discussing this very seriously. He told me that he can't tell me whether I should stay or go, which is a valid point because in the end I know that it is my decision to make. He said though that if I decide to stay, he will "wonder" about the "future" with me because he wants "marriage" and a family. And, since he wants that in the near future, I would have to want the same thing. 

I took some time to think about it and, when I did, I saw myself marrying him and making little biracial babies. When I went back to discuss this with him, on Valentine's Day mind you, he completely changed his mind! I was so pissed. At first, he just stood quiet and didn't say anything. So I asked him what he thought about it and to say something. He said that he didn't know what to think, he's not sure and that it was a big decision to make. I flipped and told him that it it isn't fair to me to be with someone who "isn't sure." You want me or not. Simple as that. We made up the next day. He said he was sorry and that he'll think about how he truly feels. I apologized for pressuring him to give me an answer when he wasn't ready. 

We talked about it more yesterday and things just seem to be getting worse. We are on shaky ground. That's how bad it is. He said, "I think I don't feel the same connection that we used to have." The tears just started pouring out of my eyes. He says he loves me, is still attracted to me and still has fun with me. He doesn't want to break up. I just sat there in silence. I couldn't believe it. He said that he doesn't know if it's something he's making up in his head (sabotaging himself) because he's afraid of commitment. I told him that I just got my answer right there. I couldn't be with someone who didn't see that same connection with me. All the other things just aren't enough. I felt terrible. I was trying to figure out where I went wrong and what I did to eff up so bad. All of a sudden, I saw my dreams of a County wedding (I'm not much of a princess wedding type. I get bad anxiety around a lot of people on top of that.) and biracial babies fade away. He cried a lot. And, he was adamant about not wanting to  break-up either. He said commitment scares him because people can get hurt. That it's better to leave early. He said he didn't leave me early because he loved me. I was the longest relationship he ever had (one year and two months). I told him I needed space to think about everything. 

I believe that he loves me. I love him too. A part of me wants to stay and fight for him. But, there's another part of me that asks why should I stay and fight for someone who doesn't want to fight for me? What if I stay and it works out? What if I stay and it doesn't? What if I leave? What will happen to me? I know that if I leave I will always wonder about him. I will always wonder about the man that I loved and left behind. It seriously kills me to think about leaving back home to Chicago and living the rest of my life without him. I don't even want to imagine about all the nights I'm sure I'll be crying myself to sleep. I really want to do the stupid thing and stay. Stay with the man who can't guarantee me that he won't run away tomorrow. I guess it's true that love makes people do stupid things. 

I was secretly crying at work all day trying to wrap my head around everything. Should I just go home and move on with my life?  I realize I'm not privy to the whole story, but from what you've written, it seems to me that your SO might love you but isn't in love with you. He wants to be with you because he cares for you and is comfortable in your relationship, but he "doesn't know if he feels the same connection he once did" and he's all of a sudden not sure about your future.

I think you need to have a bigger talk with him and see if he's just scared of commitment or if he's scared of commitment with you. I asked him if he was just scared of being alone and if he's just gotten into "the habit" of being with someone. He said it wasn't that. It's the possible hurt that either one of us can cause that scares him. He hurt me already though. I don't even know what to think anymore. :(</snippet></document></searchresult>
