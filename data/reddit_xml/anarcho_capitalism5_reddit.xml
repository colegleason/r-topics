Plus, it amuses me immensely. Agreed, let them show who they really are.  In any 'anarchic' society, people will arrange themselves into "charter city" (panarchist) like arrangements, which are anywhere between mutualism, propertarian, and perhaps several mini-religious states.  Beyond that, I expect the more **extremist** leftist type arrangements  to self-destruct *(or be vastly inferior)* due to everyone being in everyone else's business.

Despite all my complaints about /r/AnCap, this subreddit is nothing compared to /r/Anarchism .  Let them be authoritarian self contradictions.

Plus, it amuses me immensely.  There are feminist supremacists who want to enforce a supremacist vision in the most authoritarian way possible.  The are very attracted to (leftist) anarchist spaces in order to coopt anarchism to their agenda.  The most extremist and hateful feminists have obtained mod status in /r/Anarchism, and all of them except perhaps dbzero have zero anarchist thought, and are only there to promote hatred of men.

The 2 main ways that the state oppresses are through putting people in prison or the military.  It disproportionately targets males.  State institutions (police and courts) in the west are completely devoted to protecting women from rape, domestic violence, and unfair pay, and ensure that any children they get receive support.  Nearly every elected politician is a feminist, and women are more privileged than oppressed within our strong states.

In anarchist spaces everyone is accepting of promiscuity, queerness, and the equal right to any opportunity.  Much more importantly though, even after that Dorner guy kills off the entire government, the cultural norms that use words that can sometimes insult slut faggots will be completely unaffected.  Cultural norms are unrelated to anarchism.  Sure lets all try to be polite, but let's not allow supremacists to impose their hatred based on imagined sensibilities.

Feminism's social engineering goals should be pursued outside of anarchism.  Only egalitarianism and real oppression should be anarchist issues.

literally the great purge Shut up retard Your humor didn't go over my head.  inb4 "oppressive speech." Damn! I missed it. Radical feminism has so infected that board that it's sad, but entertaining, to watch. It has infected it to the point where they institute "privilege" and "oppression" hierarchies where people with more silly labels are given credence (and even power) over others and offending those people means you get censored (unless you are even more oppressed). And these rules are set and enforced by a small set of people. So, they instituted a system which sets up a hierarchy to "correct" the perfectly equal power between users...

I don't think they should change at all; I like people to see what these people actually act like when they are handed any amount of power whatsoever. This user's post is a similar reaction to when I first stumbled across that subReddit (being an individualist anarchist). I made a similar post about it (much shorter and focusing on the censorship, banning, creating unequal powers through mod censorship) and was subsequently banned after I satirically patronized a mod for thinking "I'm offended" is actually a legitimate response to substantive criticisms about actions versus ideology. Their response? "Oppressive speech will not be tolerated." I burst out laughing, satire, after all, is oppressive speech!

If you don't frequent or subscribe to the subReddit, don't vote. It's a bit rude.


edit: added detail about my first stumblings around reddit subReddits and interactions with /r/anarchism.  To any friendly left-anarchists types who are looking for a friendly *[non-authoritarian](http://i.imgur.com/OM3tjwq.png)* and open-minded subreddit, I highly recommend you stop by **/r/MarketAnarchism** and check out the sidebar.  If that seems like your kind of thing, you're more than welcome!  Wow. Well this opened my eyes. The amount of down votes it's getting is amazing.

I love the point they make about the whole 'privilege' ideal, and about the use of words. I'll use whatever fucking words I want. However, as I'm a decent human being, I'm not going to call someone a 'nigger', 'kike' etc...

I think the whole leftist rad-fem has gone in there and subtly taken it over. I don't think they will allow the notion that there are other ways to preserve human decency and gender equality, other than leftist feminism. &amp;gt;Subtly  
  
Hah, I think it was like 5 months ago SRS and /r/communism basically joined together, and with communism went /r/anarchism, /r/socialism, they pretty much copy pasted the sidebar rules I believe and even had a picture of SRS's 'BRD' mascot for a while.  
  
The socialists were explicitly welcomed with open arms in the fempire and the radical left lived happily ever after.  
  
I only know this because an acquaintance tried to get me into SRS and I fell into a spiral of rage for a good 8 weeks. They are amazing trolls, I'll give them that. Just violent, self righteous, biologically, historically and economically uninformed idiots.    </snippet></document><document><title>NHS spends &#163;240,000 per year on homeopathy</title><url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19798824</url><snippet>  In case you don't know what homeopathy is; it is pseudo-science, completely unproven and totally contradicts everything we know about how both humans and the universe work. Just think of it as the medical equivalent of Keynesianism.

The worst part is that this isn't even the biggest waste of money the state has managed. At least Keynesian economics takes advantage of wacky math, so there's some thought put into it. Everything I've read about homeopathy suggests there's no reason to even *think* it has merit.  In case you don't know what homeopathy is; it is pseudo-science, completely unproven and totally contradicts everything we know about how both humans and the universe work. Just think of it as the medical equivalent of Keynesianism.

The worst part is that this isn't even the biggest waste of money the state has managed. You say that, but what's really crazy is that there is a sizable contingent of libertarians that buy into this strain of alt-medicine voodoo bullshit. I get that the majority of medical research is funded by the state, but for fucks sake, that doesn't mean the correct position is at the other end of the spectrum next to blood-letting and shamanism. There does seem to be a sizable portion of the libertarian community that appears to reject evidence-based medicine in favour of quackery. Lew Rockwell likes to peddle the writings of Joseph Mercola, for instance, which always causes me to scowl when I see it. Lew definitely has a few screws loose. In case you don't know what homeopathy is; it is pseudo-science, completely unproven and totally contradicts everything we know about how both humans and the universe work. Just think of it as the medical equivalent of Keynesianism.

The worst part is that this isn't even the biggest waste of money the state has managed. It's not just unproven, it's dis-proven.  

It breaks something called Avogadro's limit and it turns out water doesn't get imprinted with the shit it had before. In case you don't know what homeopathy is; it is pseudo-science, completely unproven and totally contradicts everything we know about how both humans and the universe work. Just think of it as the medical equivalent of Keynesianism.

The worst part is that this isn't even the biggest waste of money the state has managed.   &#163;240k is nothing when it comes to government waste       so im guessing that you guys all have an immense amount of trust in the medicine that the state controlled/regulated medical health industry has put forward?

i have personally had a tremendous amount of help from homeopathic medicines, and have actually experienced a great deal of harm from mainstream medicine, and have found mainstream doctors to be completely retarded..but i guess thats just my personal experience 

i dont understand all the hostility towards homeopathy in the ancap community

that being said the government shouldnt be spending money on it lol

isnt most mainstream science "psuedo-science"?

it is in my view, but im alot more skeptical of mainstream science than alot of other ancaps that i know, which honestly surprises me considering how much control and influence the state has over it Hostility towards homeopathy isn't limited to the ancap community. While I'm sympathetic to the argument that we have to be wary of how the State-corporate industry influences medicine, there is still plenty to be said for *evidence-based* medicine. Homeopathy doesn't make the cut; it doesn't even come close to being backed by real evidence of its effectiveness. what is evidence based medicine? and how is that evidence derived? also isnt "homeopathic medicine" a very large description to say that all "homeopathic medicine" is bunk..im just trying to understand

my mind is pretty much made up based on my personal experience, i havent been to a doctor in about 7 years (mainly due to the suffering that mainstream medicine has caused me)... but i am very interested to hear where everyone is coming from

im also curious how many people in this thread have actually attempted to try any homeopathic remedies

being an empiricist is about experimenting for yourself, not just taking state funded science at face value On the most basic level, evidence would be something consistently working at a rate higher than pure chance would dictate. We know that things like homeopathy do not work because they cannot meet even that fairly simple standard. On the other hand, you have a high degree of reliability in ibuprofen's (to pick an example) ability to relieve your pain, because it has been demonstrated to work at a high rate of success... you may not wish to take such drugs, and they *do* have side effects (some of them particularly harsh!). That's another matter entirely, separate from whether or not it *works as advertised*.

Further, we even have a good idea as to *why* things like ibuprofen work. For homeopathy, we can actually find good reasons as to why it should *not* work, and this has been indicated by others in this thread. people that use homepathic medicine usually find that it works consistently at a higher rate than pure chance would dictate...im guessing afew mainstream studies override that? 

would you chalk everyones personal experience up to the placebo effect?

im sure that the placebo effect plays a role with all types of medicine...but the majority of the people who i know use homeopathic medicine, i do as well, we have great health, no problems, dont need to goto doctors

so for me, that is empirical evidence that this stuff works more often than chance would dictate I also do not visit doctors, because I've been fortunate enough to be in good health. I also enjoy consuming scotch. Therefore scotch must be what is keeping me healthy. Ok, not really; my personal anecdotes do not constitute evidence, nor do yours. And correlation does not equal causation.

My favourite homeopathy joke: Did you hear about the homeopath who forgot to take his medicine and died of an overdose?

 so im guessing that you guys all have an immense amount of trust in the medicine that the state controlled/regulated medical health industry has put forward?

i have personally had a tremendous amount of help from homeopathic medicines, and have actually experienced a great deal of harm from mainstream medicine, and have found mainstream doctors to be completely retarded..but i guess thats just my personal experience

5. Person B refuses to give back the money. 

There is no means of courts or other figures of power, possibly because they have no means to pay for it. What would be the right thing for Person A? Does amount matter? Can Person A justly hit B? Or does B commit fraud, and gets a different punishment? 
What if the agreement was for sex?

I apologize for having a vague understanding of Anarchy-Capitalism, but I wanted to know this perspective of this problem. 

Edit: Is this too much of a moral question? I will be back later tonight to clarify anything.   The short answer is that failure to perform services is enforceable through ostracism, not physical force.  Here are some quotes and a link about some ancap thinking on contract theory:

6.	&#8220;A contract in which payment is to be made for the performance of a service, such as an employment arrangement, is not an exchange of titles because the employee does not transfer any title.&#8221; (Kinsella, LCT, pg 14)

7.	&#8220;there would seem to be no way to compel someone to perform an agreed-upon action, such as a service.&#8221; (Kinsella, LCT, pg 14)

8.	&#8220;contracts involve only conditional transfers of title to scarce resources external to the body. Promises cannot actually be enforced.&#8221;

9.	&#8220;Title to one&#8217;s body is inalienable, and it is not subject to transfer by contract.&#8221; (Kinsella, LCT, pg 20)

10.	&#8220;The solution is to recognize that the defaulting debtor may not be punished simply because he is not a thief at all. If the debtor is bankrupt, there is no property to steal. The debtor is not &#8220;refusing&#8221; to turn over &#8220;the&#8221; money owed. There is no money to be turned over.&#8221; (Kinsella, LCT, pg 23)

11.	&#8220;The theory of contract espoused here demonstrates that fraud is properly viewed as a type of theft.&#8221; (Kinsella, LCT, pg 24)

**edited from failure to pay to failure to perform But this isn't a failure to pay. Payment has already been made for a future service which will not be performed. According to Kinsella's reasoning, a conditional transfer occurred and the title to the money in B's possession remains with A (A still owns it because the conditions for transfer were not satisfied).

Your comment speaks about untransferred payments and unrendered services. It's merely a promise because titles have not been exchanged. That is not the case here. You're right.  I should have wrote failure to perform instead of failure to pay.  I fixed in an edit.  The quotes still provide the answer.  Thanks. They would, except Kinsella is wrong.. or at least, your quotes don't answer the situation here.  A contract in which payment is made for a performance of a service does involve a conditional transfer of title - the transfer of the payment.  Proper recourse *does* allow for physical force, *but only to regain the payment rendered*.  If I say I will provide you a service in exchange for $5, but simply take your $5 without doing the service, *this is stealing*. I think I agree with you.  Restitution does seem to be justified after your explanation. The short answer is that failure to perform services is enforceable through ostracism, not physical force.

**edited from failure to pay to failure to perform Wow, this was so useful. In 5, what if they can pay, but choose not too?     The scenario you describe proposes several questions:

1.  What are the "optimal" actions
2.  What actions are are permissible (i.e. "justice")
3.  What actions are likely?
4.  What actions could have been taken before this scenario?

My Answers:

1. Ostracism, blacklisting, public reviews, hits to credit rating, publicize #B's actions.
2. Any proportional force:  punching (as described in the contract), forceful retrieval of equivalent value, blackmail, or anything listed on #1.
3. Usually #1.  Occasionally #2.
4. Money could have been held in escrow, to be paid only on fulfillment of contract.  #A could have verified reputation of #B *(i.e. through credit agencies and/or reviews)*.  Pay half before, half after (lower risk). 

Usually an arbitrator is one of the alternatives on #1, but arbitration is not the only option.  All of the above exists as an option, even WITH an arbitrator available.

For more information, see my article: *["Restitution, Arbitration, and Refusing Arbitration"](http://jamescarlin.wikidot.com/refuse-arbitration)* &amp;gt;Usually an arbitrator is one of the alternatives on #1, but lucubration is not the only option.

Read that as "lubrication" and was really confused with how justice was administered in your system... &amp;gt;Usually an arbitrator is one of the alternatives on #1, but lucubration is not the only option.

Why?

That seems like an arbitrary instruction to me.  Ignore arbitrary rules! Dress for utility!  I dress fashionably for the utility of being attractive That works. My main complaint is people spending far more on clothes than it costs to look good. Consider Steve Jobs' "uniform", or a basic t-shirt and jeans, black shoes, black wool coat or similar. Bold colors, rather than random arbitrary lines and patterns. I like the futuristic aesthetic of Starship Troopers, Star Wars and Star Trek. Why *should* we wear different colored/patterned clothes every day? Why not a gray shirt and jeans every day? There's something to be said about "professional" dress being an attempt to bring about a change in internal mindset, but I'd say the internal mindset drives the external.

As a proof, when you judge a girl (for the guys), do you *really* give a shit what she's wearing, or is most of your focus on what she'd look like naked? For me it's naked. Clothes aren't us. Cold climates created that tradition. Try to be fit and have a stable mindset, and that's more of you than anything you can accessorize your body with, so might as well make clothing relatively minimal and utilitarian. I like the Liam Neesen character in Batman Begins, and what he wore, that style of being so above your clothes, that nothing but something simple can match your life. It's the difference between Hunger Games' capitol city folks and normal, utilitarian style. &amp;gt;Why should we wear different colored/patterned clothes every day? Why not a gray shirt and jeans every day? 

There's nothing wrong with an individual "uniform" it actually makes you distinctive. I think the most important part of fashion is fit and classic pieces rather than keeping up with trends. Yes, I've become a fan of slim-fit shirts, since most shirts are by default baggy and oversized for the oversize population. That works.

He believes that it is impossible to shift blame, share blame, distribute blame&#8230; as blame, guilt, responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings singly and nowhere else. But being rational, he knows that not all individuals hold his evaluations, so he tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world&#8230;aware that his effort will be less than perfect yet undismayed by self-knowledge of self-failure.

&#8220;My point is that one person is responsible. Always. [...] In terms of morals there is no such thing as &#8216;state.&#8217; Just men. Individuals. Each responsible for his own acts.&#8221; 

&#8220;I will accept any rules that you feel necessary to your freedom. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.&#8221;

Wow! Yeah, I'm using that  Imagine if this was assigned reading just once in a high school AP English class, instead of the nth minority weeping tale. Hey now, I read the autobiography of Malcolm X for my AP lit class.  I get you're point though. Are you serious? That guy is so controversial even MLK condemned him. What's next? Mein Kampf? Das Kapital? I'm confused; why is being controversial a reason not to hear what someone has to say?  Unless that is your point.  But to make reading a viewpoint *required* is different from "hearing what someone has to say." eh, a biography is required for the AP Lit curriculum.  I can't think of a more interesting one to read, regardless what his views were.  

On a side note, how could education function (public or private) if any time a teacher says "This is the book we are reading, be prepared for a discussion" a student could respond with "I think the book is wrong, I refuse to read it to understand why I might think it is"? Imagine if this was assigned reading just once in a high school AP English class, instead of the nth minority weeping tale. Chopin is the worst.   I didn't really care for how politically heavy-headed The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was. Heinlein really used a sledgehammer. It was a fun ride though, and as far as pop culture goes I think if they made it into a movie it would do way greater things for mainstreaming libertarian ideals than any Ayn Rand.  It was a fun ride though, and as far as pop culture goes I think if they made it into a movie it would do way greater things for mainstreaming libertarian ideals than any Ayn Rand.  it was super fun, but that's not why. and imo libertarian ideals are better spread when they're told in a non-explicit manner. I think a movie adaption would be fantastic, if this sort of dialogue were left out of it. I think a lot of ideas are that way. "Artists use lies to tell the truth" :D I didn't really care for how politically heavy-headed The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was. Heinlein really used a sledgehammer.

I didn't really care for how politically heavy-headed The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was. Heinlein really used a sledgehammer.  I've had this quote on my Facebook page for years, even since before I was a libertarian.  Heinlein's been tremendously influential to me both politically and philosophically.  Which one?  Apparently I *really* need to read this Heinlein guy; his name keeps popping up everywhere.    I don't really connect with the writing shared by the OP.  I don't understand this "*impossible to shift blame, share blame, distribute blame&#8230; as blame, guilt, responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings singly and nowhere else*" stuff, as free-market corporations can certainly be sued for malfeasance.  

And this "*so he tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world*" sounds like a statement from some angry teenager.  No one is asking anyone to "live perfect" to make a Stateless system work.  That is what Statists want you to think, that anarchism is some Utopia that requires us to act perfectly.  No, all that is basically required is an appreciation for property rights.  That isn't some grandiose vision of  some Tolkien fairy tale, its pretty basic and boring.

Just like Ursula Le Guin and her 'Dispossessed', I think maybe Heinlein should have had a chat with M. Rothbard before writing their books. </snippet></document><document><title>I like Anarcho-Capitalism, but i think it will devolve into some form of government eventually. Thoughts?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18he95/i_like_anarchocapitalism_but_i_think_it_will/</url><snippet>As a History lover and major, i found myself arguing against Anarcho Capitalism to my roommate. I think i make some valid points and he suggested i post them here. My argument is that eventually, it will devolve into some form of government, and i have a few reasons why it will.

1) It will do so, because of humanities need for social injustices. Without one person being above another, capitalism can not be sustained. You need a lower class to harvest the raw materials at a cheep price, then you need lower middle class to take those raw materials and turn them into products, then you need an upper middle class to oversee the distribution of said product, finally you need a rich upper class to organize and manage the entire chain. 

2) Society can not be sustained with out government. The second someone gets robbed or mistreated in any way, they will want someone to step in and correct this injustice. The second someone is appointed to the position of "injustice corrector" they will inherently have power over people, and in a modern society, with a large population, you will need multiple people to help maintain the peace (which would mean they would be a lot harder to do away with if they abused their position). Also, what is to keep someone from outside the community and the "injustice corrector" jurisdiction from giving you trouble? Therefore you will have to appoint someone to protect you from the outside forces. Once you have that, why not expand your society? after all more land under your control means a bigger profit for  you, and isnt that what Capitalism is all about?

3) If i understand my roommates argument correctly, big corporations will be tempered by consumerism and thus preventing corruption. However, what if a few companies ban together to form trusts? these companies, now unified have the economic ability to dominate a particular region, and what is to prevent them from turning that region into versions of company towns http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_town where the company controlled everything from the housing to the jobs and the stores. Yes, people could leave, but how many of them would have the resources to make it out of the region? furthermore, with their whole family in this region, how many people would want to abandon everyone, despite the disparity? And realize, i am not arguing that you would see the degree of corruption demonstrated in the days of the company tows, but rather living standards that just meet acceptable, so that people have something to loose if they speak out.

4) I would like to draw reference to early Mesopotamia. Here you saw the development of farming. Before farming, humans practiced hunting and basic gathering and had no true social order. but once humans figured out how to cultivate and grow their food, people were able to settle down and form the first cities. When not everyone was needed for food production, people were able to begin to diversify and specialize. With these specializations came wealth and status. And with wealth and status came a hierarchy that led, in part to a king. Another thing that led to the first kings were the development of rival city-states, and the need to defend the all important land and wealth from those who would otherwise take it. All lessons applicable to any point in human history.

I am sure i left one of my arguments out, but i forget it. i might add it later in and edit if i remember.

TL;DR- Anarcho Capitalism cannot work because of greed, the need for social order, and the need for protection.

EDIT:

Wow, you guys (and gals) are quite smart. I am finding it hard to come up with a valid argument for a lot of these comments. You can not find this sort of maturity on /politics. Please do not be offended if i do not respond, it just means your point can not be argued.  I do not support the end of slavery because there is a chance it will come back, which is intolerable to me. This argument most fundamentally addresses the flaw in thinking here. When did we get flair? When did we get flair? Sometime in the past 2 days I believe. Woo flair! I do not support the end of slavery because there is a chance it will come back, which is intolerable to me. I do not support the end of slavery because there is a chance it will come back, which is intolerable to me. The argument for a "Reemergentist" might be:

I do not support the end of slavery because this master gives me steak, A/C and Cable TV, while every other master in history has given their slaves dog food and concrete for mattresses. Indeed, they see what they have to lose rather than what they stand to gain. It's called Loss aversion in economics, and one of the reasons why AnCap would need to start out small, possibly someplace that's presently unoccupied, because everyone else would be saying "gamble with your own goddamn life." ~~No, it's called "shooting yourself in the foot."  Your time is likely better spent finding profitable ways around the existing system rather than trying to expend what will undoubtedly be a great deal of effort making a bad system marginally more efficient and therefore harder to get rid of.~~

Ignore this post.  I derped. &amp;gt; No, it's called "shooting yourself in the foot."

 I'm pretty sure the concept I was talking about matches loss aversion. Shooting yourself in the foot is active, making do is passive.

 Historically passive groups who transition to political activism have a poor record of success, such as the evangelical christians who were catalyzed by Falwell's "Moral Majority" only to see it turn into something ugly. Ideologists looking for revolutionary change often get it, but the results are rarely what they had in mind.

 Until it's been shown that AnCap societies work as advertised and are desirable places to live, it's not irrational to be dubious of Yet Another Socio-Economic Order^TM Sorry, I thought you had responded to a different comment in a different thread and I hadn't bothered to check what I was responding to. Oops, no prob. Made the same mistake myself yesterday. I do not support the end of slavery because there is a chance it will come back, which is intolerable to me. I do not support the end of slavery because there is a chance it will come back, which is intolerable to me. I don't support curing diseases either, because the person is going to die later anyway. I don't support taking a shower because I will need to again later.    &amp;gt;1) It will do so, because of humanities need for social injustices... 

These people are only "above" each other in terms of wealth and they are wealthy as a consequence of their productivity. Unlike other anarchist schools, anarcho-capitalists are non-utopian, especially in regards to the division of labor and thus the equality of wealth. Many ancaps believe that a stateless, market-ordered society would as a side-effect tend to equalize wealth. Those who become wealthy would do so by continually operating at the margins. They would be innovators, prudent investors, and those with unique talents (actors, singers, artists, etc.).

Anarcho-capitalism  does not intend to do away with the division of labor or inequalities of wealth. Ancaps maintains that wealth will equalize (relative to our society now) because of the more efficient divisions of labor provided by market mechanisms.

&amp;gt;2) Society can not be sustained with out government...

Please watch this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o), and if possible read the book for free [here](http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf). It's what introduced many others and I to anarcho-capitalism. I had many of the same sorts of questions and I'm also a History Major. It will help if you have read up on some basic economics. Wikipedia is a great starting point, and then head to this subreddit and find more articles to read. Anarcho-capitalism is better argued based on its economics, than it's deontology (natural rights stuff).

&amp;gt;3) If i understand my roommates argument correctly,..

Consider this... what you are essentially describing is a state: A few powerful groups gain monopoly power over a territory and exploit the populace through the cartel -&amp;gt;

&amp;gt;"Yes, people could leave, but how many of them would have the resources to make it out of the region? furthermore, with their whole family in this region, how many people would want to abandon everyone, despite the disparity?"

The same argument applies to states. States are really just monopolies that exploit a certain defined territory for the benefit of a well-connected elite. They have to make some concessions to the subjects to prevent revolt, especially as the state's territory and population increases. The most prolific today is "representative" government, which is basically an illusion of representation and more like a system to keep people factionized and at perpetual ritual war with other factions within the territory. the factions, of course are "represented" by the wealthy and well-connected elites.

States have been the sole source and cause of monopolization (in the sense you use it). In a robust free market system, there is always competition, actualized or potential, internal or external, to break the cartel.

&amp;gt;4) I would like to draw reference to early Mesopotamia...

I think hierarchy has existed long before the neo-lithic era. A causal glance at non-human species should convince you that animals, including mammals, live hierarchically with pecking orders that are violently enforced. Humans simply carried these tendencies into the new agrarian world. that is very well thought out answer. however, i have just one point to make

Anarcho-capitalism does not intend to do away with the division of labor or inequalities of wealth. Ancaps maintains that wealth will equalize (relative to our society now) because of the more efficient divisions of labor provided by market mechanisms.

For most things yes, but as far as resources such as oil/coal/metal/ect..(i say ect... because i can think of no other examples, but i am sure they are out there) once someone gains control of those, it would be hard to get those same market mechanisms that apply to technology and end product goods, to apply to these. especially if the local providers of these get together to control the market. it is not like people can easily walk a few miles to another provider. Lets assume such a cartel has formed, and as part of a role playing experience I am part of it.

Now this cartel is good yes, but since I already know what everyone wants the price set at, if I put mine just a bit lower I could momentarily monopolize the market and make more in a month than I would all year with the cartel. . . MUAHAHA suckers! that is very well thought out answer. however, i have just one point to make

Let's assume that cartelization does happen for an entire resource (doubtful) and the firms are able to maintain cartelization indefinitely (doubtful).

1. Competing firms provide the resource synthetically
2. The resource is replaced by another resource (coal power -&amp;gt; nuclear power).

And those options will be present before and during a formal cartel. Without a state apparatus to disguise the operation as something beneficial to consumers and entry-level competitors, the cartel would be in all likelihood short-lived or fictional.

The fear that cartels may form in a free-market is not a cogent reason to thus actively support cartelization through the state. &amp;gt;    1. Competing firms provide the resource synthetically
&amp;gt;    2. The resource is replaced by another resource (coal power -&amp;gt; nuclear power).

 I don't think we currently have substitutes for Tantalum, but even if we do there are other raw materials that are both rare and without alternatives. Also, supposing an alternative was developed, would the time gap be long enough to provide a would-be state with a sufficient window of opportunity? that is very well thought out answer. however, i have just one point to make

Every system collapses at some point, for some reason. Whether it be ignorance, apathy, corruption, an outside force, or some inefficiency that is overlooked somehow and exploited, an anarcho-capitalist society will not last forever. If it could last a thousand years, it would be wonderful. If it could last ten years, it would still be unmistakably wonderful. A moment of liberty among thousands of years of slavery is surely a thing to strive for and believe in; not only will an anarcho-capitalist society last at least a bit longer than a moment, but it will set a precedent of freedom. One a person tastes true liberty, it is very difficult to be lulled into slavery once again. The worst-case scenario (not including one in which humanity is destroyed) is that a tyrannical government (sorry, redundancy there) will lull the people into slavery, and cover up all evidence they can find of anarcho-capitalism ever having existed. Even if they succeed, how long until the government collapses? How long until rational thinkers spring up once more, and understand society in an objective lens? Voluntaryism is not a fleeting thought of some political analyst that has been blown into larger proportions; rather, it is objectively the end-game of secular ethics, and the only result of rational analysis of objective truths with respect to societal order. If "1+1" were lost, it would most surely be determined again, because it is objectively true, and it only takes so long to find the truth. It could take forever to re-discover the concept of monarchy, since it is made-up, but not voluntaryism.

tl;dr: Anarcho-capitalist society will inevitably fall. Our goal is to bring one about and prolong it for as long as we possibly can, but even more importantly, to make sure that no one ever forgets it once it has been established. If it is forgotten, don't despair, because it will, without a doubt, re-emerge, and eventually a new voluntaryist society will be created. You make no argument here that i can disagree with. And that is a profoundly true point, once people taste the freedom, all governments afterwards will have to try to model themselves off of that, else risk revolution. Definitely, they would have to either pretend to be a government sponsoring liberty, or they would have to work incredibly hard at covering up the fact that liberty ever existed.

Our largest problem is that it is very difficult to convince a slave (let alone millions upon millions) with Stockholm Syndrome that it is better to be free, and especially difficult when we are all slaves and none of us have experienced freedom. Once people are educated and no longer ignorant, they will free themselves. (hopefully through agorism and the collapse of the state, violent revolutions tend to create power vacuums since they are so sudden, also they're just in bad taste if we're trying to create a society of peace)

Our second largest problem, the largest once we establish a free society, is the problem of maintaining that society; protecting it from the artificially wealthy, the powerful, outside forces, etc., prolonging it as long as possible, expanding it as much as possible, and making sure that it will have an incredibly prominent legacy.

Compared to these two problems, minor ideological differences, even the difference between capitalism and socialism, seem petty. (although this difference would actually tie into the second problem, since if society ended up drifting towards making voluntary socialism the most prevalent version of free society, it would most likely collapse much quicker than anarcho-capitalism) A better example of a petty dispute might be intellectual property or something along those lines. wow, you sir are an incredibly well educated and wise person. I cannot argue one of these points. You just have to start from an objective truth, and work out an ideological perspective from there. If you do that kind of thing, you can reason out the proper actions to take in any situation, all of the reasoning behind the philosophy of freedom, and a whole lot more.

I started out as a minarchist who just had a preference for freedom, but after a while I was introduced to /r/Anarcho_Capitalism , and I ended up figuring it out. :P It's honorable to love freedom and help others achieve it, but even more honorable to know, beyond intuition, why freedom is right.

There are a number of so-called "objective truths" that are not objective in themselves, but are deemed so by many anarcho-capitalists. Things like self-ownership, ownership of one's labor, ownership of the property of one's labor, rights, etc. I try to view these things as the consequences of deduction based on objective truth (although to many they're deduction based on intuition).

So long as you think rationally and thoroughly about something and start from the right place (objectivity), you'll come to the right answer. It also helps that we're typing here, so I can spend time editing and looking over what I've written to make sure everything is consistent and correct. Still, no one can no everything about a given subject, and especially in the case of the knowledge of the workings literally every aspect of a society. For example, I still really have no idea how private property can be justified over another type of property, and thus I have no idea how property disputes should work if a mutualist and a capitalist were having the dispute. I've been trying feebly to figure it out, but I haven't come up with a good answer and haven't heard one that satisfies me.

I'm not wise or well-educated, I just start with an objective truth and look for its ramifications. What are your objective truths?  Every system collapses at some point, for some reason. Whether it be ignorance, apathy, corruption, an outside force, or some inefficiency that is overlooked somehow and exploited, an anarcho-capitalist society will not last forever.

Have you ever read "Time will Run Back", by Henry Hazlitt? It's not quite the same situation you're describing, but it's pretty close. A very interesting read, all in all. 
 I haven't, but I'll look into it, now that you've said it. I'm afraid I still have a number of books to read, and I also have a lot of The Twilight Zone to watch. :P Every system collapses at some point, for some reason.

 That's one of the best arguments I've seen against "Reemergentism" (a term I invented in an earlier comment, in respect to a re-emerging state), I wish you were in the "Ex AnCap" thread from a couple days ago.

 It's like approaching the problem de Maistre style ("Every nation gets the government it deserves"), you repeatedly infect the culture with examples, mindsets and values.

You shouldn't bother cleaning up, because it will just get dirty again one day?   &amp;gt;Without one person being above another, capitalism can not be sustained.

Can you clarify this statement? I don't see at all how this is the case.

&amp;gt;You need a lower class to harvest the raw materials at a cheep price, then you need lower middle class to take those raw materials and turn them into products, then you need an upper middle class to oversee the distribution of said product, finally you need a rich upper class to organize and manage the entire chain.

How does this lead to the reemergence of a government?

&amp;gt;The second someone gets robbed or mistreated in any way, they will want someone to step in and correct this injustice.

Absolutely.

&amp;gt;and in a modern society, with a large population, you will need multiple people to help maintain the peace (which would mean they would be a lot harder to do away with if they abused their position)

Yes, you do need many many people to do this. We simply want a system in which there is not one organization that holds a monopoly on providing this service. We want multiple organizations. That way, when one inevitably becomes corrupt or evil in some way it can simply be crowded out by the others who are providing better services. 

&amp;gt;Also, what is to keep someone from outside the community and the "injustice corrector" jurisdiction from giving you trouble? Therefore you will have to appoint someone to protect you from the outside forces. Once you have that, why not expand your society? after all more land under your control means a bigger profit for you, and isnt that what Capitalism is all about

You're simply thinking about this in a statist mindset. The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that the 'governments' (ie the organizations that provide justice, we normally call them DROs for dispute resolution organizations) do NOT have monopolistic control over large areas of land. Any land they have 'control' over they only have control over as long as the actual owner allows it. This makes it impossible for them to expand by seizing control of areas of land in the way that a state does. They must provide the actual land owners the services of justice etc in order to expand their profits.

&amp;gt;However, what if a few companies ban together to form trusts?

There's been immense amounts of literature written on this subject, but basically, without a government to grant them privileges and encode their collusion in law, any large collusion such as this would be highly unstable, and if all consolidated into one company would simply be outcompeted by smaller more efficient companies due to diseconomies of scale.

&amp;gt;Yes, people could leave, but how many of them would have the resources to make it out of the region? 

This whole scenario is such a far-fetched scenario it's hardly worth addressing, but do you really think people can't afford 50 bucks in gas? I mean come on...that's like all of half a day's work if that. The whole thing could never happen simply because anything in that area that wasn't bought by the company would become exponentially more valuable. Many people would simply refuse to sell, many would only sell for so much it wouldn't be worth it. Media would go into a frenzy over allegations in inhumane treatment, etc. Company towns can only exist in geographically isolated or undeveloped areas in the first place, which in today's world (at least in developed nations) means just about nowhere. Plus, can you really imagine people putting up with that in today's world? It's laughable at best and akin to being worried that we're all of a sudden going to regress a couple hundred years and start enslaving Iraqis or something. 

As for your fourth point, I don't get what it has to do with a polycentric law society reforming statutory law.

TL;DR - Anarcho-Capitalism would work because distributed, non-monopolistic law would be more effective at providing justice, security, and defense than centralized, monopolistic law. In my view, capitalism extracts as much wealth as possible with as little investment. therefore capitalism will always lead to inequality. 

&amp;gt;You're simply thinking about this in a statist mindset. The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that the 'governments' (ie the organizations that provide justice, we normally call them DROs for dispute resolution organizations) do NOT have monopolistic control over large areas of land. Any land they have 'control' over they only have control over as long as the actual owner allows it. This makes it impossible for them to expand by seizing control of areas of land in the way that a state does. They must provide the actual land owners the services of justice etc in order to expand their profits.

but what is to keep a rich company from simply hiring a group of people to take that land. in my opinion, this is a highly optimistic view of not only society but of humanity itself. there will always be people who want power, and have the ability to convince others to pick up arms and follow them. Once one person picks up a gun for another person, this entire society comes apart. There are just too many people out there who want what you have, and instead of working for it, would just rather take it by force.    The state is that one rich company, and their shareholders and subsidies  are always coming for what you have.

You want to solve the problem by putting fire out with fire. The source of the problem is the fire. im confused, i am not offering a solution, but rather questions for answering.

1) How has this evil company come to be so large and wealthy if people hate it? Was it a good company that simply went bad? Looking at it in isolation without any history behind it is folly. 2) It would simply be resisted by other companies that are hired to do just that. 3) Violence is incredibly expensive and they would almost certainly be operating at a loss, not even including the enormous hits they'd take due to others reacting to their actions. (getting thrown out of stock markets, investors pulling out, credit/reputation ratings tanking, etc etc)

&amp;gt;Once one person picks up a gun for another person, this entire society comes apart.

This is such a ridiculous statement. Of course it doesn't. Our society spends TRILLIONS killing people, and yet our society is relatively stable. We do not expect that there would never be war or conflict, of course there would be! It would simply be much smaller and more isolated than in a statist world with tax financed armies.

&amp;gt;There are just too many people out there who want what you have, and instead of working for it, would just rather take it by force.

Yeah, but it costs more to hire people to take it from me than it would to just buy the damn thing from me lol   This is off topic but I have a question regarding property rights in a Anarcho-Capitalist society. Who enforces them? I mean how do you have rights without some form of judge making sure everyone respects them. If there is market demand for courts then courts will develop. Judge.me is a good early example of private arbitration services.  Ok, but what forces the opposing party to comply with the private judges decision. Forgive me if I'm mistaken but I was led to believe Anarcho-Capitalists do not believe in the state enforcing property rights.  you should look in examples of free market, hint - the Internet. What forces Amazon and other store users to comply? The State? But there is no state in the internet. Here's your answer. Interesting example. I just look at it in property rights terms, or in just "rights" in general. I mean sales between people go on today without oversight all the time and people understand the risk but I don't understand how Anarcho-Capitalists can believe in "rights" with no "one" body to enforce them. Aren't "rights" something that everyone has to recognize and obey. Interesting example. I just look at it in property rights terms, or in just "rights" in general.

I mean how do you have rights without some form of judge making sure everyone respects them. Property rights (or any other "rights", for that matter) are impossible without government.  Anarcho-capitalism is a pipe dream for this reason alone.   haha that was funny, nice try at trolling :) still a novice, aren't you? Please explain how property rights exist without public law.  polycentric law. Another ancap fiction. 
 people going to moon was fiction too. You don't seem to understand. Law has to be monopolistic by definition.  It's not just a fiction - it's an oxymoron.  Maybe "Law", but not "law".  You don't seem to understand. Law has to be monopolistic by definition.  It's not just a fiction - it's an oxymoron.  Laws have never been monopolistic. They have never applied to everyone equally.   I don't have time to read all of your points, but I quickly read number 2 because it caught my eye. 

I think that society can surivive with out government. This is all about perspective. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, in the primitive times (weird analogy but just go with me on this) the thought of government had yet to be established. They all lived together in harmony (mostly). Now. Governments came along much later but we won't get into that. 

I believe that people believe that they need government just like I believe that I need to go to school. I don't *need* to go to school, but it makes things easier for me. I can just learn all this crap on my own though. 

Look at spain during world war two. There's a nice documentary on the Anarcho Communists that popped up in southern spain and had fully functioning communities with out government for quite a while until the Fascists came in. Also, in Ukraine before the Soviet annexation, the same thing. 

People don't need a government, but it's nice to have around to a certain degree. Gives people something to talk about at dinner parties but that's just about it.  Yes, but if you notice, there were other entities that came in and overthrew it. also look at point 3. the early humans hundreds of thousands of years ago did not live in harmony, the whole reason for the spread of humans around the globe was in part to following of game, but the biggest reason was because the growth in population caused a competition for resources, and that competition lead to conflict.

I don't understand. It's not a Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac / Ginnie Mae situation where it's a public-private entity.

I guess there is more threat of government involvement than for most private groups, but I don't think there is much of a risk of any tax money going to them. They'd just raise the domain registration fee.

There are alternative DNS systems or replacements. The Tor .onion network is probably the most well known. Or you can just use IP addresses. There was a Firefox extension created that allowed browsing to happen that way in order to get around SOPA DNS filtering if it ever was implemented.

I don't think anyone has established that Ron Paul is using government interference to get the domain. ICANN is a private organization and has rules for registering domains with them.  &amp;gt; One can be a constitutionalist or otherwise believe in limited government [and be a libertarian].

When you advocate violating the NAP, as which intellectual property does, you are not doing so as a libertarian qua libertarian. Strictly speaking, you are not a libertarian.

Devil's advocate: IP does not violate the NAP because violating IP is aggression.

There are people that would be commonly called libertarians that reject the NAP. Therefore, they are libertarians and NAP-acceptance is not essential to being libertarian.

How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one. 
If a lot of people do, then yes, it is. That's how words work. Tails and legs aren't words, they are tails and legs. See, you mean something specific by "tail" and "leg." It's what *you* mean. If most people meant something else, then that's what the words would mean. Words evolve over time - they aren't objective. They are defined by their use.

You just have very strong libertarian leanings. It's like calling yourself a pacifist even though you engage in the occasional bar fight. First of all, the IP in question in a trademark. Kinsella and others who write about opposition to IP are usually only talking about copyright and patents. The law trats all of them differently and your confusion about that is a great example of why some people don't think we should use the term intellectual property to group them all together. 

There is a legitimate libertarian basis for some aspects of trademark law because it can constitute fraud.

In this case, if the owners of ronpaul.com were using the domain to trick people into thinking that the site was endorsed by Ron Paul himself when it was not, that could be fraud. 

ICANN rules about domain squatting actually very much take this into account. In the past the owner of Tupac.com was able to keep the domain because it was make quite clear that it was an unofficial fan site and was not in any way actually affiliated with Tupak himself. You're the one that's confused. It's also clear that you haven't read Kinsella's book which is called "The Case Against Intellectual Property" and in which he argues **against** trademarks. If I sell you a Coca-Cola but it's really a Pepsi, that's fraud. You're the victim, not Coca-Cola or Pepsi.

Next time, know what you're talking about before accusing people of being "confused". He argues against trademarks as they currently exist in US law. I just reread the passage. 

And I agree with your explanation of fraud in relation to trademarks, but I think it's unclear how that has to interact with domain names that are used as part of fraud. The private, but created by the government, status of ICANN also further muddies the waters because I think a totally private DNS registrar could choose to enforce their own trademark rules. AFAIK, Ron Paul isn't trying to utilize any trademark protection above and beyond that which is in the ICANN rules. &amp;gt; AFAIK, Ron Paul isn't trying to utilize any trademark protection above and beyond that which is in the ICANN rules.

I never said anything about Ron Paul. The quote that started this exchange between you and I is by Lew Rockwell. In the article linked to in the OP, he argues that you can be a libertarian and still support violations of the NAP, either through advocating IP or some other minarchist government. My point was that I don't think it's at all clear that Ron Paul is violating the NAP by doing this. If ICANN is fully private, which is questionable since it was created and handed control over DNS registration by the US government, and if the only authority Ron Paul is appealing to is their rules, that leaves open the possibility that it's not a NAP issue, but simply one concerning ICANN rules. You're talking about Ron Paul and I'm talking about Lew Rockwell. I don't disagree with you but also, this is irrelevant. Ok fair enough. I don't care to have a debate about the definition of the word libertarian, but nearly everyone uses to mean a much broader range of political views than just people who believe in the NAP. If you define libertarian to mean the same thing as anarcho-capitalist and voluntaryist, we now have a bunch of terms that all mean the same thing and no term to describe people who broadly believe in small government and social tolerance. &amp;gt; If you define libertarian to mean the same thing as anarcho-capitalist and voluntaryist, we now have a bunch of terms that all mean the same thing and no term to describe people who broadly believe in small government and social tolerance.

The website's content is directly about the politician Ron Paul, and not about any other ron paul or any other subject.

If the rules of the private ICANN organization provide for this claim, then there's nothing wrong with what Ron Paul is doing, as everyone involved voluntarily agreed to these rules beforehand.

Property is whatever you can defend. Given that the squatters agreed to ICANN's rules, Ron Paul has ICANN to come to his defense ***without initiating violence***. The squatters are doomed.

They no doubt had an opportunity to sell RonPaul.com at a reasonable price and ensure some kind of maintenance for their [legitimate] work, but instead decided to play [a rude game of chicken](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/18difb/israel_from_ronpaulflixcomron_paul_has_not_gone/c8dxw4d) and lose according to the rules of the game they *chose* to play. &amp;gt; If the rules of the private ICANN organization...

That's a rather odd thing to read on /r/anarcho_capitalism. Most the people here subscribe to the Lockean concept of property not the might makes right concept of property. I'll give you some point for holding a unique opinion.

&amp;gt; Given that the squatters...

How can you be a squatter of your own property? The term squatter generally refers to somebody that occupies property that they don't own under the generally accepted principles of ownership in their given society. The owners of ronpaul.com purchased the domain under the generally recognized system of acquiring domain names, meaning they don't qualify as squatters.

&amp;gt; They no doubt had an opportunity to sell RonPaul.com at a reasonable price...

No. There is nothing stopping organized people from implementing an alternative administration of DNS information.

There are 2 prices given in an exchange between 2 parties. In this case, each party felt that the other's price was unreasonable; this led to the engagement of other legitimate dispute resolution machinery. &amp;gt; It's based on reality, not ideology.

Kudos for being a realist. I actually hold a similar view of property and am often lambasted by libertarians for stating that, at least pragmatically, property rights are what you can get others to recognize.

&amp;gt; No. There is nothing stopping organized people from implementing an alternative administration of DNS information.

Actually the matter isn't so black and white. Several ISPs were "caught" (I use quotes because I'm bettering their terms of service alerted customers to their practices) using different DNS setups in order to direct traffic means for search engines like Google and Bing to the ISP's customer search services. Needless to say that [opened the door for legal action](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/08/small-isps-turn-to-malicious-dns-servers-to-make-extra-cash/) on the grounds that doing so violated United States wiretapping laws.

To say there is nothing stopping organized people from implementing their own DNS requires ignoring state regulations, especially in regards to ISPs. One could argue that such matters are outside of ICANN's control but at the same time ICANN, being a state-created organization, can also legitimately be considered part of the state.

&amp;gt; Allow me to repeat myself: Given that the squatters agreed to ICANN's rules, Ron Paul has ICANN to come to his defense without initiating violence.

You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means. Based on ICANN's rules the current owners of RonPaul.com are the legitimate owners. Unless ICANN sides with Ron Paul on the matter the current owners are the legitimate owners, by the very criteria you set forth, and therefore not squatters.

&amp;gt; There are 2 prices given in an exchange between 2 parties. In this case, each party felt that the other's price was unreasonable; this led to the engagement of other legitimate dispute resolution machinery.

You said the owners of RonPaul.com had a chance to sell the domain at a reasonable price. The statement necessarily implies that the offer they were made was reasonable but now you're saying neither side found the price reasonable.

Who decides what price is reasonable and why do they have that power? ICANN was not created by the state.  It is an organization that was created when groups of people got together and said "We need an organization for this purpose!"  It then worked with other organizations providing infrastructure relevant to the internet to work out agreements.

That the US Government pretends like it is giving them a license is bullshit.

ICANN predates that, and is an example of a completely anarchic, independent, organization arising without needing the blessing of any government. 

This entire thing is all about contracts with ICANN and the forum is ruling on that contract.  The only reason that this ruling has "force" is because the people who manage the infrastructure of the internet (also mostly individual organizations) agreed to those rules.

It's contracts all the way down, for the most part. (Government does like to get involved and there is a US anti-cybersquatting law, but that isn't at issue here.) &amp;gt; ICANN was not created by the state. It is an organization that was created when groups of people got together and said "We need an organization for this purpose!"

The history of ICANN, [according to ICANN](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/history), came about due to a joint decision by United States Department of Commerce and Network Solutions, Inc. Looking back at the [history of Network Solutions, Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Solutions#Registry_and_registrar_business) you find that they were granted a monopoly on .com, .net, and .org top-level domains by the National Science Foundation (itself a government foundation). Due to Network Solutions, Inc.'s practice of charging $100 for a domain name and censoring domain names the Department of Commerce decided to step in and together a plan was drafted to allow competition in the realm of domain sales. In all likelihood, due to the state's involvement in the entire matter form the start, it was decided that a private corporation would be given the power to control domain registrars.

ICANN was created (after, not predating, the decision made by the Department of Commerce and Network Solutions) to be the oversight corporation and was granted the authority by the Department of Commerce. To say it was the creation of individuals coming together and fulfilling a need overlooks the fact that the "need" was mandated by the state through the Department of Commerce.

To claim the creation of ICANN was not due to the state would be akin to claiming that the creation of [Corrections Corporation of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections_Corporation_of_America) was not due to the state (specifically due to its creation of federal prisons and, later, its desire to shed the cost of operating those very prisons).

If you want to see an organization that was organized by individuals who sawa need to run a domain name system have a look at [OpenNIC](http://www.opennicproject.org/). Yes, no group of people could have POSSIBLY existed before some government deemed them into existence.  Most of your rant is about network solutions, which actually proves my point. 

The page you link to is about the registry system. You link to it to dishonestly pretend like the only facts it mentioned (eg: the history POST Dept. Commerce action) is all the history that exists. 

Of course, this isn't supported by this page.  Nowhere does it rebut what I said. 

But that's not how arguments work anymore, becuase nobody gives a fuck about learning anything, and they're much more interested in finding some link to some page to try and "prove" someone wrong.

Here you are, talking to someone who witnessed some of the events in question first hand, and you couldn't be bothered to actually learn from me... no you'd rather "prove" me wrong by linking to some page on a different topic and then going off saying things about network solutiosn that doesn't even address the issue at hand (but that you're dishonestly pretending does.)

The best (worst) thing about this profoundly dishonest method of arguing ?  You are trying to force me to debate some page on the internet-- when in reality, you admit that you don't know fuck all about the situation at all.

This makes you an intellectual coward and a piece of human shit.  Try thinking sometime.  Seriously, you're profoundly anti-intellectual, a reality denier.   And you stupidly, smugly, probably think that this page (that isn't actually relevant to the point) is "reality". 

Jesus fucking christ. Why do I waste time with such idiots?

 No.

The website's content is directly about the politician Ron Paul, and not about any other ron paul or any other subject.

If the rules of the private ICANN organization provide for this claim, then there's nothing wrong with what Ron Paul is doing, as everyone involved voluntarily agreed to these rules beforehand.

Property is whatever you can defend. Given that the squatters agreed to ICANN's rules, Ron Paul has ICANN to come to his defense ***without initiating violence***. The squatters are doomed.

They no doubt had an opportunity to sell RonPaul.com at a reasonable price and ensure some kind of maintenance for their [legitimate] work, but instead decided to play [a rude game of chicken](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/18difb/israel_from_ronpaulflixcomron_paul_has_not_gone/c8dxw4d) and lose according to the rules of the game they *chose* to play. &amp;gt;The website's content is directly about the politician Ron Paul, and not about any other ron paul or any other subject.

This does not give Ron Paul rights over the domain.

I suggest you read the rules, they are not in Ron Paul's favor.

I don't remember the exact question or the thread and I'm kicking myself for it now.

Anyway, in that thread, some people mentioned an anarchist thinker (I think from the 1800's). His philosophy on property was essentially "if you can take it and defend it, it's your property. If someone takes it from you, it's their property". This is a gross over simplification, but I'm hoping someone can help me with his name.

"All of them." I'm not sure how much money. Any ideas on the market price? I'll give you $20, but I need to see a pic first This is my first offer. Not much demand so far.

I got mad that people were speaking for me in their posts (We need to stand with Obama, The Gay Community Needs Hillary Clinton, etc.), so I brought it up. Now I'm ostricized as a "self-hating republican". The Libertarian Party has supported gay marriage in its platform since the 1970s.  Why does government have anything to say about marriage in the first place? I do not believe the government should be involved in marriage.

As a practical matter, the Libertarian Party takes a stance on issues in between statism and minarchism/ancapism. Getting gay marriage legalized is much more feasible than taking all marriage out of the law. If you pay attention to what is really driving this whole gay marriage brohaha it is the trial lawyers lobby. They are salivating at the thought of all those gay divorces and the huge amounts of revenue they are going to get doing them. Why does government have anything to say about marriage in the first place? Because somewhere along the way Government thought it was a good idea to incentivize marriage, and straightfags decided they could use the extra cash/benefits so they voted in favor of Government getting its dirty High fructose corn syrup-covered hands all over marriage.

Now I'm ostricized as a "self-hating republican". See it's really interesting because in my opinion, Obama just shit all over the gay community. In 2008 he ran on an anti-gay marriage platform. Only near his second election did his views "evolve". As a final slap in the face, not a month after reelection, his administration said something to the effect of, "gay marriage won't be a priority during this term". 

It's just so funny because Romney was portrayed as socially backward and regressive, yet gays rights would have been treated the exact same way under the two administrations - as a state issue. I can't stand how the state issue is being treated as a god send now. As if it's good for the federal government to cop out and allow states to decide if gay marriage should be legalized. That's not good. That's completely regressive. Just take away DOMA. That's all that needs to be done. I got mad that people were speaking for me in their posts (We need to stand with Obama, The Gay Community Needs Hillary Clinton, etc.), so I brought it up. Now I'm ostricized as a "self-hating republican". Fuck them. Have you tried lurking around the anarchist communities? It of course has its own host of problems, but generally speaking you won't see any of that shit going on. I do. But I run into those problems as well. They don't like capitalists. lol.

So I can imagine how they'll treat other abtracts. I don't think they necessarily dislike them (I remember one thread where many of them stated a sexual preference for feminine guys).

But I just thought it was funny how they have "guns" listed as one of their interests and when the subject of gun control came up they were all like, "I don't understand why anybody should have a gun except for police and troops!"  The groupthink is so strange.

Maybe I should start a "non-liberal-gay" subreddit.  Help me think of a better name for it that rolls off the tongue easier! "Flaming Freedom"...oh wait...hmm...if I think of one, I may just create the sub myself. :) I'll let you know! I put in a request for /r/FreedomFellows

ITT, straight guys are jealous. I suppose my real sentiment is "I wish there were more ancaps" so the distribution of gay ancaps would be larger as well. It's pretty difficult to find a gay ancap, and as the idea of a serious relationship with a statist makes me nauseated, I am unfortunately without realistic options. Ah. Well it's not exactly a consolation but straight guys aren't much better off :(

I can't imagine having a meaningful relationship with a statist either but single ancap women are almost impossible to find. Dude you gotta convert them with your cock. My girlfriend didn't start out ancap but now I'm practically left-libertarian in comparison to her. Lol. I have it worked out.

Plan A: Convert a woman to the principles of voluntaryism.

Plan B: Go gay. Dude you gotta convert them with your cock. My girlfriend didn't start out ancap but now I'm practically left-libertarian in comparison to her.

I was thinking of designing our own flag.  Gay Ancap here. I think one of the issues we really should start talking about around here is the concept of "free love." Not the crazy, titty-shakin' free love of the 1960s, but the free love that was ahead of its time in the Women's suffrage movement. The idea that love and sexuality should be free from the intervention of the government. As a voluntaryist, when I hear leftists scream about "women's rights", I have to roll my eyes.

Please take the opportunity, in this discussion of all things gay (and we should talk about sexuality and love as a whole) to check out some of this stuff. Great ammunition for when you get a pretentious Democrat and a backward Republican talking about their conception of women's rights.

I'm somewhat surprised you're getting pro-state perspectives from the homosexual community given their run-in at stonewall and what not. I know government is now more "accepting" of who you choose to love than they used to be, but I would think there's a lot of anti-government sentiment quietly left over.

One of the things that has been really going on in my mind is how much I hate going through airport security.  I have no problem with flying, taking off, or landing.  I have a huge anxiety problem with going through security.  I thought for sure that it was simply some paranoid delusion from being around so many strangers at once.  I never really made the connection to my sexual orientation at all.

Now that I openly admit here that I am gay, it makes a little more sense for me.  I really hate how the TSA sexually molests people and then pretends that getting a male or female to match the person for patdowns is somehow less invasive.

If anything, having a male pat me down is *more* invasive, even though I don't think it really matters at all, and the fact that my sexual orientation has anything to do with security is completely ridiculous.  For someone who dreads flying again but will have to start doing so again in the near future, what can people do to avoid or minimize this harassment?  It's about humiliation. It's about pleasure at your expense for the masters. It's about demonstrating to commercial travelers in particular, who go through these checkpoints multiple times a week, that they're property of the state.

It's about sharing some power with formerly downtrodden populations, establishing a loyal bond between the unemployable and their masters.

It's about corrupt deals between insiders looking to make easy money selling a humiliation device to the masters.

It's about establishing absolute power. What does anyone know, what goes on in the back rooms? It starts like this, but where does it end? When will they start picking suspect travelers for 'enhanced interrogations?' They can start whenever they like.

That's why it's there. That's the rationale. It only makes no sense if you pretend that the state is something that it's not. It's about humiliation.

I'm a straight male and would prefer a female to fiddle with my dong. Have you seen what the TSA females look like? I couldn't conjure a boner if my life depended on it. Have you seen what the TSA females look like? I couldn't conjure a boner if my life depended on it.  You're gay too?!

Good lord, so many gay ancaps lately!  I'm actually happy that here in Australia, we have no such pat downs. We just put our bags and personal items through an x-ray, go through metal detectors and then jump on the plane (if it is a domestic flight). There are some 'random' searchers though.

However, they're thinking about bringing more scanners and 'protection' methods in, which I think is bullshit. There have been NO domestic plane bomb threats in Australia, and the security is done by the air lines themselves. The extra protections are trying to be brought in by the government. 

They were also thinking about bringing in thermal cameras to catch people who are sick, which, as someone studying medicine, is ridiculous.  &amp;gt; They were also thinking about bringing in thermal cameras to catch people who are sick, which, as someone studying medicine, is ridiculous. 

Can you go in to more detail about that?  Is it not effective?  If not, why?  Shouldn't it be able to catch anybody with a fever.  Obviously that doesn't cover all (most?) illnesses, but it should be able to catch some, right? The median temperature for someone can vary depending on what medical or genetic issues they may have. There are several reasons why a person can have a fever... be it a basic ear infection that is not contagious to influenza.

They wanted to bring these in when the swine flu epidemic came around, but they didn't actually catch that many people. Mainly because where they were going to position the cameras in places where customs or other security members could not pick them up.

Also, what would be the criteria for apprehension on medical terms? To have an entire fully fledged pathology clinic to test for all sorts of illnesses would take an incredible amount of time an energy.

I think the only reason they wanted to put them in is to placate the general public over swine flu fears. It wouldn't be unreasonable for an airline to require a note from a doctor for a someone with a high fever to fly.  Or at least require a mask or something.

But you are right though, when my temperature hits 98.6, I'm probably sick, or at least fighting something off.  I just run a low temperature most of the time.  So people like me could get through sick, whereas other people who tend to run hot would be unnecessarily stopped.  I hate flying for this reason as well (plus the expense). 

I don't quite understand why you dislike the people you're sexually attracted to pat you down though? heck, if I could have a woman pat me down, then I seriously might go through the line 2-3 times, picking out the lines with the best looking women. I think it might have something to do with the fact that I am not openly gay.  I live in a conservative community and do not think I am in a good position to be openly gay, nor do I really have a wish to be as I am a very private person.

It makes me uncomfortable precisely because I am not sexually attracted to every man I come across.  I don't think every straight guy is attracted to every woman they come across either, right? yeah, of course we don't want every woman touching us, but I think it's passibly acceptable to have most of them touching us. I suppose they don't really hire the best looking people (men or women) for the TSA. 

Can you imagine how much better things would be if you had your choice of guard to pat you down! :) ... Next time I go through airport security I'm going to request the hottest guy to pat me down.  I'm going to try to imagine it is metro-sexual Bruce Willis Jeffrey Tucker patting me down.  It is going to be super awkward.

How can this plan go wrong? ;p </snippet></document><document><title>Anarchy - Awesome Speech.

&amp;amp;#3232;\_&amp;amp;#3232; They could have been talking about Keynesians... No, 'cause Keynesians use math which as we know automatically makes their perspective both correct and morally superior to anyone else. And makes them more handsome. And makes their personal preferences objectively valid, instead of the silly Austrians and their arrogance to declare all value subjective. We just need to bamboozle them with some Austrian charts or something, I'm sure we can make something up. I read that as "Austrian chants" at first and was suddenly very excited. Charts aren't nearly as fun, but I guess it works. Maybe we can just string together a bunch of unrelated graphs and just say it's related to the irreducible complexity of the market and the inability to properly isolate variables to study? No, 'cause Keynesians use math which as we know automatically makes their perspective both correct and morally superior to anyone else. And makes them more handsome. And makes their personal preferences objectively valid, instead of the silly Austrians and their arrogance to declare all value subjective. Actually, I think most people would say it is *arrogance* to merely declare all values subjective... instead of, you know, proving it. 

Carry on.  I'm interested in how one would even begin proving something like this. I view the idea of subjective/objective preference as something that must by definition be assumed. So if it is in fact arrogance, I don't see how it can be any more arrogant than making the opposite assumption. Well... there's arguments and there's evidence. You could give either of those a shot. 

It's not that assuming subjective values is more arrogant than assuming objective values, it is that assuming it is vastly more arrogant than justifying it.  &amp;gt; The key to "economics" is conjecture based on abstract principles that ignore evidence or reailty at every turn.

&amp;amp;#3232;\_&amp;amp;#3232;  I keep seeing "living wage" thrown around online... I really don't think people understand that not everyone needs, deserves, or wants a "living wage" from every job. 

I remember delivering an afternoon weekly paper, it was paid by the route (number of houses) it was like $4 and took me just over an hour. I enjoyed having something to do, I was young (13 or so) and that little bit of money made me have worth. I could buy a soda with my own money, I could learn to budget "here's what I have and here's what I want." I didn't want/need/expect a living wage from that! 

I know older people that just want "something to do" or "spending money" and would take minimum wage at a local shop, or less at a low traffic location. Maybe they get paid $4 an hour to sit and read until someone shows up? But maybe they don't Want to work a high traffic McDonald's, sure they might get paid more, but maybe they don't want the hassle of the food court McD's at the local mall when their in their 70's. 

One of my grandparents worked at a clothing store made just over minimum, part time, but it was something enjoyed. It was seen as a way to get out of the house and socialize.

Young/Old/Lower skilled - all these types of people are hurt by this, not just economically, but potentially in other ways such as rights and purpose.

/rant If the minimum wage was high, couldn't such people (ie: 13 year old you or a retiree who wants something to do) get a job under the table? 

I worked at a little shop when I was in my early teens, and did that. Swept, organized, watched for people stealing, and was given about $5 an hour off the books. The whole illegal thing makes it considerably more difficult to get those kinds of jobs.

I worked at a little shop when I was in my early teens, and did that. Swept, organized, watched for people stealing, and was given about $5 an hour off the books. When I was 13 the local bar owner needed someone to help clean up on saturday and sunday mornings.  I convinced him to hire me and he sat me down my first morning and explained payroll taxes. I said well if you pay me cash do I make more. That's when I realized how the government screws low wage employees.

There was a thread in /r/Libertarian on the minimum wage as well. It got SMASHED by statists, and it didn't seem that any of the libertarians had the arguments or studies to deal with the influx. 

Also, there seemed to be an insistence that lower employment would be taken care of by the increase in demand from increasing wages, and therefore will greatly improve the economy. I had to stop reading.

&amp;gt;i don't think anybody cares about a slight decrease in employment short term if you're creating demand long term.

Vomit. When we see threads like this we should post a link to a copy of 'What is seen and what is not seen' and upvote the shit out of it.  As much as that idea appeals to me, I feel like it is blatantly ineffective. No one will read it. They'll see that the link goes to Mises or something and reject the information offhand, like I see a lot of people on our side do when something comes out of a source we believe is biased. Its hard NOT to do.

I mean, how hard is it to see one of the most basic supply/demand systems of economics? 
But that's also the point at which I've learned not to argue or debate with statists (or /r/libertarian ), cause it becomes about economics instead of rights... No right to tell another man what he can and can't do voluntarily! It doesn't help when the wiki entry notes stuff like this

&amp;gt;A similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the American Economic Association. Whaples found that 37.7% of respondents supported an increase in the minimum wage, 14.3% wanted it kept at the current level, 1.3% wanted it decreased, and 46.8% wanted it completely eliminated.

That's 37.7% for increasing the minimum wage and 46.8% for abolishing it, total opposites.

[This comment thread was the last straw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18f32s/obama_calls_for_raising_minimum_wage_to_9_an_hour/c8e9qqi) I strongly advise you to either stop looking at r/politics or admit you like pain and wasting time. &amp;gt;you like pain

Maybe a little bit.

&amp;gt;wasting time

I disagree. The ignorant, slogan-chanting, misinformed Marxists that populate /r/politics are more or less the same as the masses all around us. Now I don't know about you, but I like to check in on the lemmings from time to time just to see whatever it is they want to change (for the social good, of course) next. 

Keeps me on my toes, but to each his own.  Similar point: when people talk about a restaurant or store being "greedy" when prices rise or quality drops.  It's inflation, not the specific restaurant.

I mean, it still sucks, but let's blame the right people - those assholes in DC! It is really sad how many people don't understand inflation. They need to start teaching basic economics in middle school, I'm sick of dealing with grown college-middle aged people who don't understand basic economics. Then again this is the outcome of a state run school system... I'm in middle school at a private school in Canada. We had a unit on economics, but it was mostly Keynesian theory. We didn't really learn supply and demand or any basic "laws" of economics. People either think it's a subject for greedy rich people to learn, or they are just not interested by it.

In debating tournaments in my city, I have rarely received an argument based upon economic theory.

Can someone explain to me what this means?  The Bill of Rights (first 10 amendments to the constitution) were originally designed to only apply to actions of the federal government, hence the first line of the 1st Amend. &#8220;**Congress** shall make no law&#8230;&#8221;  It wasn&#8217;t until the early 20th century that the Supreme Court began applying (&#8220;incorporating&#8221;) the amendments to the states, under the 14th&#8217;s privilages and immunities clause and due process clause.  The court has done this on a case by case basis, a process called [selective incorporation]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights#Selective_versus_total_incorporation) , and over the years has incorporated amendments: 1, 2, 4, part of 5, 6, and part of 8 [source]( http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/incorp.htm).  Because the court has either not had a case on an amendment (i.e. 3rd amend.) or has not fully incorporated due to specific problems (i.e. $20 requirement of 7th amend.) your professor is correct, the states are not bound by all of the provisions in the bill of rights, only the ones the court has incorporated to them. Oh ok, so is it only the 3rd amendment that hasn't been incorporated?   Fun fact about the bill of rights-- read the preamble.  No rights are created (which is why it says "congress shall make no law", rather than "people have the right to...")... all the rights pre-exist the constitution.

Which means, if the constitution doesn't explicitly give the government the power to do something, they can't, and doing so is violating rights. 

This is why there's a right to privacy, abortions and machine guns, even though none are mentioned in the constitution. Which means on a federal level there's a right to murder and steal as well.

*edit*

I'm saddened to see this subreddit is now using the 'downvote those who you disagree with' tactics. Not exactly. Murder and theft infringe others natural rights to life and property. Granted the right to property is challenged by certain philosophies but since we are in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism I think most people will agree on that it is a natural right. Well he mentioned abortion... which is homicide.  I think a few of us here would disagree that that is a right under the Constitution. Abortion isn't homicide. One might argue it is the same thing in fact, but legally it was (prior to Roe v. Wade) pretty much always distinct, because, not having been born, the foetus didn't have legal personality - this concept was inherited from English common law. This has been changed by some states to equate abortion with homicide after the mother feels the baby moving, or after foetal "viability", which only goes to show that abortion isn't intrinsically, automatically and unquestionably equal to homicide like your post implied. A fetus is undoubtedly human.  The definition of homicide is 'The killing of one human being by another human being.'  Abortion is clearly homicide. It's 'The *intentional* killing of one human being by another human being.'

So, at what point can a woman kick her child off her property? If the child refuses to leave can the woman escalate force?

I think you see where I'm getting... I know where you are going, and I disagree completely with evictionism as being an applicable scenario.  The unborn child did not choose to trespass, rather was brought on to the mother's property without consent... then killed.  Hardly a fair comparison.  It's akin to kidnapping me, bringing me on a plane, and telling me to leave mid-flight.  

You may see it as justifiable homicide, but that doesn't change that at the root it is homicide.  And I simply don't see abortion as a natural right.  I recognize it as mostly unenforceable in an an-cap world, but it doesn't change how I view its morality.   I feel the same.

I like to hear the arguments for and against abortion in the ancap community. It's largely avoided for obvious reasons. People don't want to find out that their anarcho-friends disagree with them over such an overly-emotionalized issue.

As long as people want to have abortions and willing to pay for them the market will accommodate. No way around it.

edit: *removed ad-hominem.* A fetus is undoubtedly human.  The definition of homicide is 'The killing of one human being by another human being.'  Abortion is clearly homicide. Personhood clearly begins at birth. (See how easy it is when you don't have to provide an argument and just use an adverb instead?) Personhood may start at birth... it's something that can be legitimately argued.  Some like to tie sentience to it... some will tie it to a discrete human life.  

Do you dispute that a fetus in a human mother's womb is human?  

I sense you don't like the reality that abortion is homicide.  When a person is euthanized, it is also by definition homicide.  Personally I take no issue with the latter so long as it's under the consent of the individual whose life is being taken.  But with abortion at least be honest about what it is.... don't hide behind marketing terms to make yourself feel better about it.   &amp;gt;Do you dispute that a fetus in a human mother's womb is human?

No. Doesn't imply it has the same rights as born people.

&amp;gt;I sense you don't like the reality that abortion is homicide. When a person is euthanized, it is also by definition homicide.

Wrong. "Homicide" is a criminal definition. It is whatever the law defines it to be - which has basically never included abortion of, say, a 10-week foetus.

Abortion and euthanasia are *killing*. This is the non-legal term you seem to be looking for. Yes, they are.

&amp;gt;But with abortion at least be honest about what it is...

It is killing a being which doesn't have the same rights as people, due to the fact of not having been born. Birth equals personhood, which equals having the same rights as everybody else.

And why is this? Because a foetus's life is biologically dependent on the mother. A 24-week premature baby can conceivably survive without its mother - maybe the fact that she died was precisely the reason why they had to take the sucker out of her womb. A foetus, *while it is a foetus* (i.e. is inside its mother), can't be said to have an independent right to life if its life depends on the mother. Who is thus entitled to terminate its life if she so chooses. Personhood may start at birth... it's something that can be legitimately argued.  Some like to tie sentience to it... some will tie it to a discrete human life.

But for debates sake, until an agreement is come to as to what constitutes a person (which is the root cause of the debate on abortion,) I like to leave it out. It tends just to be another thing people want to focus on instead of the topic at hand. Which means on a federal level there's a right to murder and steal as well.

*edit*

I'm saddened to see this subreddit is now using the 'downvote those who you disagree with' tactics. No, it doesn't. The enumerated powers do not enumerate murder or theft.    It's a word game.  It's semantics.  Nothing else.  

Rights do not exist in the sense that they are granted from government.  Rather they are privileges that they choose to grant or not.

Any privilege granted today can be taken away tomorrow if a sufficiently large portion of the population supports those actions.  

The idea that rights have to be incorporated (or accepted) by a sufficient share of the states is merely an attempt to add legitimacy to this game.

What use is gold if you won't trade it for something? There are many metals that are far more useful for hording and actually producing something of value. As far as I know, gold has very little value when it isn't either turned into something more valuable (like jewellery) or isn't used directly as a currency. Gold is great for making food-related items (I'm way into coffee, and gold filters are revered for their non-taste-altering properties, also the ice cream tester guys use gold spoons for this reason), and highly conductive and resists corrosion, great for electronics. As soon as we stop valuing gold as jewellery and currency, we can put it to better use in tools.   What if a power hungry businessman got all the fish? What if he got all the electrons in the world?

I think free-market solutions are generally the best way for interested consumers to preserver/conserve wildlife and that government has mostly been irresponsible with land management.  The common anarcho-capitalist offer to environmentalists curious about anarcho-capitalism is that in a free market, environmentalists can just "buy the land" if they care about it.  But how true is?  Help me untangle this experiment and show me where I am wrong:

Let's say there is an arbitrarily large forest with zero human improvements, to the extent that no market court would likely validate any random person's claim to ownership of the forest (as in, no market organization would willingly validate/defend/support someone's claim to owning the universe based on their claim alone, so arbitrarily smaller dimensions of the universe, such as a forest, would be no stronger).

I decide I really like this forest - this forest in its natural state, offering its natural resources, is valuable to me - so I homestead near it (or in a very small portion of it).  I use the forest to hunt animals, collect wood, food, resins, and other resources.  I think this would represent an easement to the land of some strength (the extent of which to be determined by a court, no doubt, but recognizable in common law to indeed represent an easement).

Now, on the opposite side of the forest, a logging company starts operations.  The forest has not been homesteaded in this area, and my homestead is *not in a reasonable vicinity*, so they are free to harvest the wood.  Over time, more and more of the forest is chopped down by the logging company.

I notice, however, that this deforestation has started to have a dramatic effect on the wildlife in the forest, particularly on the large mammals and birds.  If deforestation continues much longer, these animals will dissapear as the carrying capacity of the forest can no longer sustain biologically fit populations of these animals.  It is in my interest, as it was my original interest, to have these natural resources responsibly conserved, so I visit the logging company to ask them to stop chopping down the trees.  

The logging company, quite rightly, does not recognize myself as holding any kind of authority over what to do with land I do not own or have a homestead on.  Compared to their *improvement* of the land, my easement is a rather weak claim.  By what right do I have to tell them that they can't chop down the forest because on my end of the forest, I prefer to have deer?

A legal scholar tells me: "Well, if you want to have a stronger claim to the land, you should makes improvements to it, like building roads or lighting or something that shows you mixed your labor with the land."  But this is silly!  The land is *most valuable to me* without any human improvement!  Why should I arbitrarily put effort into something that nobody desires that I desire less to fulfill this silliness?  It sounds like something the state would do.

"So why don't you and a bunch of other tree-huggers get together and buy the forest?"  How?  From whom?  If the forest has not been improved in any way, how can anyone own it?  By what right would we have in exluding people from an arbitrary area without some sort of popular legal standard?

If a court decides, "Well, we think the 10m (or whatever precident or standard is extant in the market) of trees around your homestead is a reasonable personal use, and if anyone wants to make a shopping mall next door, that's fair game", what recourse is there to be like "Well, court, your standard is bullshit because you just destroyed the forest for me, the whole reason I live there in the first place!  It's like you just see the trees and not the forest!"

So yes, I'm terribly confused, can someone help me out with these concepts?

TL;DR: How do you preseve or conserve a forest in a free market society with a common law standard of homesteading and property ownership?  Many property concepts, especially easements and homesteading, arose and function as a TECHOLOGY.  There's nothing *"objectively correct"* about homesteading or easements, but these concepts were developed as a means for maximize the utility of LAND for the purpose(s) of serving humans. 

&amp;gt; *"Now, on the opposite side of the forest, a logging company starts operations. The forest has not been homesteaded in this area, "*

This is one area which *(IMO)* has not been adequately developed enough in Libertarian legal theory.  I have several ideas myself, but haven't had the time to develop them and am mostly focused on intangible-property theory.  I suspect that, given your scenario, humans would move into those areas, perhaps homestead them or create cooperatives to protect them, build trails, etc.  They may eventually be called upon to justify their claim *(or the size of their claim)*.

The flip-size is that any logging company may have difficulty justifying their own claims to be able to freely rampage through *(mostly unused)* forests.  Without a proper claim, they'd have difficulties with any "tree huggers" who start homesteading ahead of their current logging activities. &amp;gt;	 The flip-size is that any logging company may have difficulty justifying their own claims to be able to freely rampage through (mostly unused) forests.

Why would you be prevented from utilizing land that is not claimed?  Nobody promises that you can retain personal subjective value in something and it would be foolish to do so. If the forest you rightfully own is more valuable to you with parts you have not homesteaded intact,as far as property law and enforcement go, tough cookies. If you want land you have not homesteaded to be left in its natural state, you will have to use non-Legal means to retain it as such.  The solution is easy: Set up a contract with the companies in charge of holding property deeds to ensure that no deed shall be given for the "wildlife preserve." You're basically outbidding any prospective user of the land.

Property rights are enforced via contract, just like everything else.

Or, even easier: You can just pay the logging company or whoever wants to utilize the land to preserve it instead, against enforced via contract. I don't find either of those methods particularly convincing since both depend on non-commercial interests outbidding commercial interests in a market, which i don't think is likely to happen on any meaningful scale.  It could happen, but isn't likely to happen. Then aren't you just admitting that environmentalists/preservationists are demanding that others sacrifice for their benefit, because they can't provide sufficient compensation to the rest of humanity? It's not a sacrifice if they don't own it.  It's a limitation.  A reasonable, logical limitation for the sustainability of our species on this planet.  The objection on environmental concerns for anarcho-capitalists shouldn't be something like "enforcing sustainable management of natural resources is a strong case for central planning, so environmental concerns must be false".  That people have an understandably short time-preference (as in, the length of only their lives) is a long term problem if unsustainable interactions of the environment are allowed to occur for the sake of an individual's freedom that results in the loss of freedom and well-being for the future. &amp;gt; A reasonable, logical limitation for the sustainability of our species on this planet.

If it's so reasonable and logical, then it shouldn't be hard to get enough people together to pool resources to keep that land untouched. You can't have it both ways: Either it's a rational and reasonable choice and most people are going to see it as such, or it's a bad choice and you'll have trouble raising capital.

&amp;gt; That people have an understandably short time-preference (as in, the length of only their lives)

Untrue. Parents absolutely have a time-preference that extends beyond their lifespan, in that they want their children to lead healthy lives as well. People in general value the preservation of legacy in their culture as well. While some people do have the limitation on time preference you describe, many do not, and it's just wrong to claim they do.

&amp;gt; if unsustainable interactions of the environment are allowed to occur for the sake of an individual's freedom that results in the loss of freedom and well-being for the future.

I really don't understand this sustainability fetish these days. It's passed down from the environmental elites in government, so that should make you skeptical to begin with. Anyone who knows anything about natural resources should be aware that logging companies, for instance, own their land and replant trees continually. Their operation is sustainable - not because they give a fuck about the environment (though I bet many do) - but because they have a financial interest in maintaining a stable income stream.

Private property is sustainability. &amp;gt; If it's so reasonable and logical, then it shouldn't be hard to get enough people together to pool resources to keep that land untouched. You can't have it both ways: Either it's a rational and reasonable choice and most people are going to see it as such, or it's a bad choice and you'll have trouble raising capital.

That's not true at all.  There are plenty of things are individually irrational and collectively rational, and the opposite is also true.  Whitetail deer in America was almost extinct in the 1930s due to over-hunting because individually, everyone wanted to hunt deer, but eventually the resource almost went extinct until the government started regulating hunting and investing in conservation efforts.

People in general value the preservation of legacy in their culture as well. While some people do have the limitation on time preference you describe, many do not, and it's just wrong to claim they do.

I think it is more true as you describe on a smaller (individual) scale, but the more general the issue, the less people care.  There are many behaviors in our society that show this to be the case.

&amp;gt; I really don't understand this sustainability fetish these days. It's passed down from the environmental elites in government, so that should make you skeptical to begin with. 

Environmental elites in government?  Get over yourself.  While there are undoubtedly environmental elites, most people who care about the environment, who actually live and work in the environment, are common people, whether they're hunters, farmers, or just have a rural background.  It seems to me that the people with most warped and out-of-touch views about the environment are people you describe, but also many people such as yourself who are probably just as removed and comfortable and air-conditioned telling me the reality of real issues such as biodiversity, sustainability, and wildlife/habitat management.

&amp;gt; Anyone who knows anything about natural resources should be aware that logging companies, for instance, own their land and replant trees continually. Their operation is sustainable - not because they give a fuck about the environment (though I bet many do) - but because they have a financial interest in maintaining a stable income stream.

Not all logging is done on private land, but certainly private land is definitely the way to encourage proper land management.  But sustainable logging aside, there are also loggers who chop down forests for development in which your example doesn't address (never mind the differences between old and new growth ecosystems, or how logging activity disrupts wildlife).

&amp;gt; Private property is sustainability.

In cases where the owner of the property is interested in making the most on natural, renewable resources, sure.  But how does this address the destruction of wilderness areas for development?
 &amp;gt; Whitetail deer in America was almost extinct in the 1930s due to over-hunting because individually, everyone wanted to hunt deer, but eventually the resource almost went extinct until the government started regulating hunting and investing in conservation efforts.

The primary system used to reinvigorate populations was containment of populations to restricted hunting areas - aka privatization. It just so happened that government was the entity doing it. It could very well have been a private organization. &amp;gt; The primary system used to reinvigorate populations was containment of populations to restricted hunting areas - aka privatization.

So how does an individual claim arbitrary amounts of land for deer to live in as the state did (which isn't entirely true - millions of deer live in my state and obviously most don't live in state forests.  Most live on private and largely undeveloped land).  If I have 100 square acres of land currently in my state, but my house and immediate yard only takes up about 1/2 an acre, how do I claim for myself the other 99.5 square acres that I would like for deer to live on?  Currently, land is sold in tracts determined by real estate owners and city/county/state planners and you don't need to show improvements to the land in order to use it.   I think the root of the problem is this infatuation with Rothbardian homesteading as the answer to everything ever. I don't feel it necessary to justify everything under the homesteading banner, because property rights are a social construct designed to mitigate conflict over scarce resources. Homesteading is utilitarian in nature, not deontological. The solution is easy: Set up a contract with the companies in charge of holding property deeds to ensure that no deed shall be given for the "wildlife preserve." You're basically outbidding any prospective user of the land.

Could an infinite number of people not line up and say that they want to homestead the land then? Not saying that this is realistic, but I think certainly problematic in scenarios where someone wants to homestead an area that someone else wants to preserve for aesthetic purposes or the alike.  Property deed issuers might demand some sort of evidence that you actually are looking to homestead, and would take a security deposit. The only problem is, that if the land isn't homesteaded, what gives the "property deed issuers" any right to the property? It's not homesteaded. They are merely clerks of record. If you want to know if something is homesteaded/who owns it/record of sale you have to go to one of these guys. I can see that being a likely organization in a free society, however I don't think it would at all be large or competitive, if they were just recording information relevant to land claims. Moreover, I still take issue with a group of people trying to preserve an area of land when they have not actually homesteaded it. It's a theoretical possibility, however unrealistic, that an entity could pay off individuals looking to homestead an area of land in order to preserve its natural state. Yet I don't see this being realistic, because then anyone could just contact said group looking for a payoff claiming they are interested in homesteading the land. 

Not that there is really an alternative to this, but it's not a surefire way to protect what might be considered a reserve. On smaller scales, communities could agree that they want to preserve an area, and if someone wanted to homestead that area they could be ostracized, but in the end if we want to uphold the rigidity of the homesteading principle, people who have not homesteaded the land themselves have to legitimate reason to stop them.

I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, because as much as some places have great asthetic value, they are probably better served as homes and business that will benefit humanity.  &amp;gt; It's a theoretical possibility, however unrealistic, that an entity could pay off individuals looking to homestead an area of land in order to preserve its natural state.

I figure they don't pay off every party looking to homestead, just the deed issuers so that person could never get any property protection in a court of law, since the property would never be recognized as owned.

Ultimately this is what it comes down to. Perhaps environmentalism is completely counter to any sort of humanism or betterment of mankind. &amp;gt; I figure they don't pay off every party looking to homestead, just the deed issuers so that person could never get any property protection in a court of law, since the property would never be recognized as owned.

I'd be interested in where you heard of these proposed deed-issuer companies. From my own perspective, it seems as if they are antithetical to the homesteading principle. I don't see how someones property rights could be "less-valid" if they did in fact homestead the land in accordance with the homesteading principle, but were not recognized by a group of individuals with no claim to the land and seem to be described as monopolistic in their approach to recognizing land claims.

&amp;gt; Ultimately this is what it comes down to. Perhaps environmentalism is completely counter to any sort of humanism or betterment of mankind.

I think so, but I wory about things like the rainforst, which provides 20-40% of the earths oxygen supply. I think this could cause major conflict in the future in a free soceity.   One of the biggest problems of the state and it's violent coercion is externalities. An example of an externality is when a business pollutes the common space, the government will defend that business (assuming they are politically well connected) and the cost of cleanup is placed onto society. 

A common externality is security. A bank or business can't typically afford to pay for all their protection needs, so it gets passed along to the taxpayer in the form of a common police force. naturally the police are directed to protect the politically well connected businesses before everyone else. thus security is a common externality, where the expense is placed onto the taxpayers rather than the business.

So one of the principle benefits of anarchy is to eliminate externalities. If a business (or you) wants security, then it bears the full cost. Everyone decides for themselves how much to spend on security based upon their individual circumstances. This point alone will reduce the amount of land claimed by people, because the more land they have, the higher the costs in security. 

I think a lot of ancaps have a hard time with this idea. Many seem to think that if someone owns something, they don't need to defend it and it's somehow societies responsibility to protect their property claims. I disagree. It's the owners responsibility to protect his own property and if he doesn't, thats a sign of abandonment. 

In your case, if you want to defend a forest, then hire a bunch of guards to patrol it and stop the company from logging there. &amp;gt; I think a lot of ancaps have a hard time with this idea.

So, might makes right?  First Point.  Would a logging company clear its forest land?  Wouldn't it rotate logging with planting, to maintain the value of its land?

Second Point.  I don't think a free market would allow people to have nature preserves in the sense that you want.  The free market solution to arbitrarily large land claims is to insist that claimers emborder and homestead.  Homesteading means that you would have to put your land to some use.  You can put in roads and trails.  You can put in campsites.  You can take actions to prevent forest fires.  You can do animal husbandry of animals that are unique to that area (eagles, rare species).  You can put in cameras to view where animals gather (like those ape documentaries).  You can give helicopter tours.

Third point.  If the second point is true, a free market wouldn't allow nature preserves in the unused manner your talking about. &amp;gt; First Point. Would a logging company clear its forest land? Wouldn't it rotate logging with planting, to maintain the value of its land?

Sure, so private property is a great solution for property owners interested in harvesting renewable resources from their property.  The issue is private property owners collectively destroying large amounts of wildlife areas for development, which I'm not against in an individual way, but on a large scale, the actions of many property owners could have a huge net detriment to human life.

But what it is valuable to me is *not doing those things to the land*.  Furthermore, most of those activities would only represent weak easements to the land and probably do not represent a strong case for homesteaded land.

&amp;gt; Third point. If the second point is true, a free market wouldn't allow nature preserves in the unused manner your talking about.

Exactly.  I haven't seen a convincing argument about how wildlife areas are supposed to be protected by interested parties - even if a lot of people expressed a desire (money) - because there supposedly isn't any legitimacy to non-homesteaded land.  Even if someone like Bill Gates said "I have billions of dollars and I want to buy lots of wildlife areas", it wouldn't be respected.  If you think this is satisfying, then why do so many ancaps - and Molyneux says this a lot - simply say "if you care about the forests, you can just buy them"?  It's not true according to their own preferred legal market of homesteading.
 &amp;gt;But what it is valuable to me is not doing those things to the land

Yes.  You're screwed.  I'm making the argument that a free market would not support non-use.  If this is important to you, then you need to support central planning and autocracies.

I don't think your arguments holds up. There _was_ an adventage of microwaves over ovens otherwise people wouldn't have bought it and people wouldn't have produced it in the expectation to sell it.

You say this like there is some alternative. The market value of *anything* is dictated only by the laws of supply and demand. Yes, you are correct that there is a risk that the value will change over time, but the value of *everything* changes over time. Given that the total supply of bitcoins is fixed, the value ought to be about as stable as possible. The central bank of each country can buy and sell their fiat currency as to control its value. If there is too little demand and the value goes down, they can choose to buy government securities and thus limit the supply, therefore making the value stable. That's not stabilising the value, that's *destabilising* the value. If the market price of the currency goes down and then the central bank moves it back up to some previous value, the central bank has moved the price *further* than it otherwise would have if it had just been left at the new, lower price. I do not know much about economics, but shouldn't using a currency like gold or bitcoins be very risky? The value each bitcoin has seems to be dictated only by laws of demand and supply. Say everyone buys bitcoins only to sell them later at higher prices, that would cause the currency to be really unstable and loose or gain value very fast.  It's basically online gold. We like it because government's cannot control it, or print it, or steal it, or even know about it. What is bitcoin and why do we like it? What is bitcoin and why do we like it? What is bitcoin and why do we like it? </snippet></document><document><title>Privatized schools</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18g3mi/privatized_schools/</url><snippet>Tried searching around...I saw something a little while back about how schools in Hong Kong were mostly privatized and they were much better institutions than America's schools.

I'd love to hear the reason on what made you change your opinion? Please don't downvote and keep the discussion civil.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/18dn66/former_ancaps_minarchists_still_lurking_around/</url><snippet>I believe that a lot of people don't understand AnCap properly and that's why most of them are against it, but I'd like to challenge this believe and hear your side of the story. If you have once called you an AnCap why did you stop with it? What made you change your mind? What are you now?

  I was an ancap probably three or four months after I realized I was a libertarian and continued learning about it. About 6 months after that, even though I was still basically an ancap, I dropped the "cap" half of it, and just called myself an anarchist, and was ambivalent about capitalism, finding it generally was an unclear term.

I moved on to agorism (the movement, not the tactic), which had a much more compatiblistic approach to libertarian socialists, and made efforts to understand libertarian socialism using anarcho-capitalist frameworks of thought rather than simply disparage it as unrealistic, stupid, and economically bankrupt as the mainstream anarcho-capitalists were doing.

As I began to understand libertarian socialism better, I began to be persuaded by it, and eventually started seeing shortcomings in anarcho-capitalism. It isn't that anarcho-capitalism is really wrong, because what I believe is truly important to genuine anarcho-capitalists is still true, anarcho-capitalism just began to look incomplete.

Not calling myself an anarcho-capitalist is more of me taking issue with the anarcho-capitalist orthodoxy and what I see as some unhelpful capitalist-centric rhetoric than me being separated from it. I do have large disagreements, but my disagreements come from expanding upon the insights that I gained as an anarcho-capitalist, not from the disproving of those insights.

At the moment, I generally identify as an agoristic mutualist. The historical anarchist who best represents my views is Benjamin Tucker, the individualist anarchist. So I am somewhere in that range of views, opposed to capitalism as I understand it but not an advocate of communism as I understand it.

If you are interested to hear the arguments against it, anarcho-capitalists are bad at identifying injustice. The are entire categories of injustice that anarcho-capitalists are unable or unwilling to recognize or understand. Ancaps have very poor and peculiar understandings of concepts so central to their framework of thought as voluntariness, property, and aggression. They tend to ignore historical aggression's role in creating the property relations that exist today and assume them as a baseline of justice. They also tend to assume that every replacement for a government service is of the general form of "Customers purchase services from company in free market", because this is how capitalism works. Cooperative solutions, such as "individuals gather together for mutual aid to provide services they all benefit from" are wholly ignored. The extent to which anarcho-capitalists explicitly favor mutual aid is the extent to which they insist that market transactions always leave both transacting parties better off. They generally entirely ignore mutual aid relationships which do not take a market transaction format.

Ancaps also seem to spend inordinate amounts of time trying to recreate the state under explicit contract or property. Heathian anarchism, where one landowner acts as a state, a position advocated by Hoppe, is basically the same as a state with the exception that the property right in territory is legitimate according to libertarian standards. Other forms attempt to regenerate law under explicit contract, such as rulership by the insurance/DRO/PDA complex, who will let you buy law enforcement and through mutual agreements between themselves and their adherents create a network of contract to develop explicit law, but who have no institutional or legal reason not to simply kill people who do not subscribe to the services of any PDA in their network. These forms of society are as antithetical to liberty as the state if they come to dominate, they are just within the bounds of libertarian understandings of voluntariness and consent. What these forms really seem to be, in my view, are ways to explain to statists, how to have restriction and authoritarianism by consent rather than through aggression.

While a society without aggression is a good thing to pursue, doing so in ways that restrict human freedom and liberty is not a satisfying solution to many of us. Anarcho-capitalists become so preoccupied with consent that they have lost sight of freedom. I believe that a truly free society can only be developed from legally independent individuals cooperating to the extent possible, peacefully competing to the extent necessary, helping each other to the extent they find comfortable, but generally minimizing their contractual or social obligations to one another, building a society on continuing mutual benefit rather than adversarial contract and trade, fostering a culture of self-sufficiency and enriching hobbies and creative play that leaves more people in a position to offer help than in a position to need it. This system is not the one envisioned by anarcho-capitalists generally, though it is not one mutually exclusive with the fundamental tenets of anarcho-capitalism either. I still can't call myself an anarcho-capitalist because distinctly non-capitalist arrangements more closely approximate my views.

I hope this helps explain my views. Sounds like you and I had a similar transition away from anarcho-capitalism. I was an ancap probably three or four months after I realized I was a libertarian and continued learning about it. About 6 months after that, even though I was still basically an ancap, I dropped the "cap" half of it, and just called myself an anarchist, and was ambivalent about capitalism, finding it generally was an unclear term.

All of the things you mention are *allowed* under anarcho-capitalism. Most of the ancaps with whom I speak are very in favor of charity and aid. The ancap authors all cite non-state welfare, such as the Amish system.

Would you try to stifle an anarcho-capitalist society? Most anarcho-capitalists think *any* society is fine, so long as the individuals consent to it. I find anyone who can agree to live peacefully alongside my society to be an ally. That fact that you say "that's allowed" is why I am not an anarcho-capitalist, because that's quite possibly the most anarcho-capitalist response I can imagine. Yes, you've got the right answer to the question "what should government do about it" by answering "nothing", but you haven't answered the questions like "what is the best way to organize our efforts and resources to achieve this goal we all have?" In being satisfied that you have not provided the wrong answer, you have failed to provide the best one, or to even provide any insight into what the best solution might be or why. I don't find such answers satisfying, and it's this discontent with the answers given by the anarcho-capitalist orthodoxy that is largely responsible for my exploring the alternatives in the first place.

The fact that you call mutual aid "charity" is completely misunderstanding what is meant by the term. Mutual aid is not charity, charity is one-way. Mutual aid is, as its name suggests, mutual. Mutual aid is something you participate in, not something you receive or give.

There are aspects of anarcho-capitalism that I would oppose with violence if they became relevant to me, yes, in the same way I would defend myself from any illegitimate attack. Anarcho-capitalists have an incomplete understanding of property that obstructs the realization of justice in a situation dominated by anarcho-capitalist memes and frameworks of thought. For the most part, I think anarcho-capitalism if implemented would look nothing like what anarcho-capitalists expect, and to the extent that they try to force things back into meeting their expectations by rationalizing it within the framework of property, yes, I'll oppose it. I draw a distinction between the "anarcho"-capitalist who thinks that capitalism can only be fully realized absent the state, from the anarcho-"capitalist" who thinks that statelessness can only be fully realized through capitalism. I see both currents of thought within the anarcho-capitalist movement. The anarcho-"capitalist" is my misguided friend, the "anarcho"-capitalist is the defender of injustice.

As I described in my original post, the anarcho-capitalist pursuit of consent above all else limits it. Consent is simply a condition that precludes injustice. The bigger question is what to do about injustice, and this question is one that easy falls off to the wayside of anarcho-capitalist discourse. There are injustices which are not overt attacks. There are unintentional transgressions against person and property which are not aggressions, and any agreement to coexist peacefully doesn't tell you what to do when these happen. 

It kind of goes back to the anarcho-capitalist's peculiar understanding of property and voluntariness which fundamentally puts it at odds with everything else. While the anarcho-capitalist thinks they have posited the most tolerant and universal system imaginable, what they have actually done is put every feature which creates incompatibility with alternative viewpoints into the understanding of property, where they can blame any incompatibility on the other person as an aggressor for violating that understanding of property. Anarcho-capitalists have not made the most tolerant system under which all others may flourish or die as nature and fortune would have it, they make a system fundamentally unable to address its compatibility issues without overhauling the core of the philosophy and having no process by which such a change may easily be made as the democratic anarchists would have. Anarcho-capitalists have rigged the rules of the game to favor anarcho-capitalism, and to exclude all others, and then they complain when their competitors break the rules.

Anarcho-capitalism is just one among many, it is not an exception among its rival ideologies, it occupies no central position at the fulcrum of balance between positive and negative rights. Thinking that you have found the one truth that provides the context in which all that is possible within concerns of justice may take place, is exactly the idea that I overcame when I started moving away from anarcho-capitalism.  Thanks for the long response.

I would like to point out that you are putting words in my mouth:

&amp;gt; The fact that you call mutual aid "charity" is completely misunderstanding what is meant by the term.

Read my post. I never said mutual aid is charity.

&amp;gt; That fact that you say "that's allowed" is why I am not an anarcho-capitalist

I said that what you want to do is allowed under anarcho-capitalism, not just allowed as if I have the right to approve or ban things. A clearer statement is that mutual aid and anarcho-capitalism are not mutually exclusive or antagonistic. Therefore, you must have other reasons to reject anarcho-capitalism.

&amp;gt; but you haven't answered the questions like "what is the best way to organize our efforts and resources to achieve this goal we all have?" In being satisfied that you have not provided the wrong answer, you have failed to provide the best one, or to even provide any insight into what the best solution might be or why.

Anarcho-capitalists do not claim that anarcho-capitalism is a sufficient condition for the well being of society. Anarcho-capitalists only claim that taking a person's property without that person's consent is illegitimate; anarcho-capitalists find nothing wrong with voluntarily giving up their property.

&amp;gt; There are aspects of anarcho-capitalism that I would oppose with violence if they became relevant to me, yes, in the same way I would defend myself from any illegitimate attack. Anarcho-capitalists have an incomplete understanding of property that obstructs the realization of justice in a situation dominated by anarcho-capitalist memes and frameworks of thought.

Could you provide some examples?

&amp;gt; Anarcho-capitalism is just one among many, it is not an exception among its rival ideologies, it occupies no central position at the fulcrum of balance between positive and negative rights.

Anarcho-capitalists don't believe in positive rights.

On a different note, most of your post criticizes the anarcho-capitalist discourse for not worrying about (an ill-defined idea of) injustice. Anarcho-capitalists do not deal with what "should" be done; all recognize that each individual solely acting in his/her self-interest will not make for a happy society. All recognize that, as a normative matter, we should care for the elderly, disabled, unfortunate, etc. The only divide between anarcho-capitalists and other schools of thought is that anarcho-capitalists do not want any violations of property (defined in an anarcho-capitalist sense), while other schools either (1) justify violations of property or (2) define property differently.  You never said mutual aid is charity, it was implied by the way you chose the say it.

I explained why I do not consider myself an anarcho-capitalist at the end of my first post:

&amp;gt; I still can't call myself an anarcho-capitalist because distinctly non-capitalist arrangements more closely approximate my views.

I don't care if you think that my viewpoints are compatible with anarcho-capitalism. I don't fetishize compatibility, I am concerned with concision, exactness, and accuracy. I don't like capitalism as I understand it. I explained the reasons why I differ, and I explained that anarcho-capitalism is no exceptionally compatible ideology. Other than to try to save your belief that anarcho-capitalism is exceptionally compatible, I see no reason for you to emphasize compatibility. You will not be able to sell me on any kind of capitalism on the basis of compatibility.

&amp;gt; Could you provide some examples?

Does the laborer own the product of their labor when working for an employer? If yes, then they have the right to negotiate a price for it above their wages which is never honored, and employment implies uncompensated theft of a property right. If no, then the fundamental tenet of property is violated. It does not read "A person owns the product of their capital", it is "a person owns the product of their labor". The laborer owns the product, not the capitalist. This is a gap or blind spot in the anarcho-capitalist conception of property.

&amp;gt; Anarcho-capitalists don't believe in positive rights.

Exactly, and they imagine themselves to perfectly understand the fine line between the two, with others either providing positive rights or violating negative rights or both in some way or another which is unbalanced and unjust.

&amp;gt; On a different note, most of your post criticizes the anarcho-capitalist discourse for not worrying about (an ill-defined idea of) injustice.

Justice is a condition wherein each person bears and reaps the full consequences of their actions, without passing costs onto others. You enjoy the fruits of positive consequences of your actions, you suffer the costs of the negative consequences of your actions. Nobody else suffers the negative consequences of your actions, and you do not suffer the negative consequences of anyone else's. Injustice is deviation from this principle.

&amp;gt; Anarcho-capitalists do not deal with what "should" be done;

Should the government intervene in anything ever? If you answer yes or no, then you have refuted your position here by dealing with what should be done.

&amp;gt; The only divide between anarcho-capitalists and other schools of thought is that anarcho-capitalists do not want any violations of property (defined in an anarcho-capitalist sense), while other schools either (1) justify violations of property or (2) define property differently.

No, there are a lot of other differences. You never said mutual aid is charity, it was implied by the way you chose the say it.

&amp;gt; Anarcho-capitalism is just one among many, it is not an exception among its rival ideologies, it occupies no central position at the fulcrum of balance between positive and negative rights.

Anarcho-capitalists don't believe in positive rights.

On a different note, most of your post criticizes the anarcho-capitalist discourse for not worrying about (an ill-defined idea of) injustice. Anarcho-capitalists do not deal with what "should" be done; all recognize that each individual solely acting in his/her self-interest will not make for a happy society. All recognize that, as a normative matter, we should care for the elderly, disabled, unfortunate, etc. The only divide between anarcho-capitalists and other schools of thought is that anarcho-capitalists do not want any violations of property (defined in an anarcho-capitalist sense), while other schools either (1) justify violations of property or (2) define property differently.  That fact that you say "that's allowed" is why I am not an anarcho-capitalist, because that's quite possibly the most anarcho-capitalist response I can imagine. Yes, you've got the right answer to the question "what should government do about it" by answering "nothing", but you haven't answered the questions like "what is the best way to organize our efforts and resources to achieve this goal we all have?" In being satisfied that you have not provided the wrong answer, you have failed to provide the best one, or to even provide any insight into what the best solution might be or why. I don't find such answers satisfying, and it's this discontent with the answers given by the anarcho-capitalist orthodoxy that is largely responsible for my exploring the alternatives in the first place.

The fact that you call mutual aid "charity" is completely misunderstanding what is meant by the term. Mutual aid is not charity, charity is one-way. Mutual aid is, as its name suggests, mutual. Mutual aid is something you participate in, not something you receive or give.

There are aspects of anarcho-capitalism that I would oppose with violence if they became relevant to me, yes, in the same way I would defend myself from any illegitimate attack. Anarcho-capitalists have an incomplete understanding of property that obstructs the realization of justice in a situation dominated by anarcho-capitalist memes and frameworks of thought. For the most part, I think anarcho-capitalism if implemented would look nothing like what anarcho-capitalists expect, and to the extent that they try to force things back into meeting their expectations by rationalizing it within the framework of property, yes, I'll oppose it. I draw a distinction between the "anarcho"-capitalist who thinks that capitalism can only be fully realized absent the state, from the anarcho-"capitalist" who thinks that statelessness can only be fully realized through capitalism. I see both currents of thought within the anarcho-capitalist movement. The anarcho-"capitalist" is my misguided friend, the "anarcho"-capitalist is the defender of injustice.

As I described in my original post, the anarcho-capitalist pursuit of consent above all else limits it. Consent is simply a condition that precludes injustice. The bigger question is what to do about injustice, and this question is one that easy falls off to the wayside of anarcho-capitalist discourse. There are injustices which are not overt attacks. There are unintentional transgressions against person and property which are not aggressions, and any agreement to coexist peacefully doesn't tell you what to do when these happen. 

It kind of goes back to the anarcho-capitalist's peculiar understanding of property and voluntariness which fundamentally puts it at odds with everything else. While the anarcho-capitalist thinks they have posited the most tolerant and universal system imaginable, what they have actually done is put every feature which creates incompatibility with alternative viewpoints into the understanding of property, where they can blame any incompatibility on the other person as an aggressor for violating that understanding of property. Anarcho-capitalists have not made the most tolerant system under which all others may flourish or die as nature and fortune would have it, they make a system fundamentally unable to address its compatibility issues without overhauling the core of the philosophy and having no process by which such a change may easily be made as the democratic anarchists would have. Anarcho-capitalists have rigged the rules of the game to favor anarcho-capitalism, and to exclude all others, and then they complain when their competitors break the rules.

Anarcho-capitalism is just one among many, it is not an exception among its rival ideologies, it occupies no central position at the fulcrum of balance between positive and negative rights. Thinking that you have found the one truth that provides the context in which all that is possible within concerns of justice may take place, is exactly the idea that I overcame when I started moving away from anarcho-capitalism.  &amp;gt; Yes, you've got the right answer to the question "what should government do about it" by answering "nothing", but you haven't answered the questions like "what is the best way to organize our efforts and resources to achieve this goal we all have?"

I haven't been part of this discussion but I want to point out here that an anarcho-capitalist admits to *not knowing what the best way is.* Knowing what the optimum political structure is for optimum capital allocation is not the same as knowing what the optimum capital allocation is. Permitting entrepreneurs maximum latitude in inventing competitive solutions is the best we can do.

One of my favorite examples right now is Duolingo. These entrepreneurs have managed to invent a way to make a high-quality foreign language education *free*. If you posed the question "How do we make foreign language education as cheap and available as possible?" in 1983, 1993, and 2003, the answers would have all been different. Suddenly in 2013 the answer is "It can be free if we sell the students' homework!"

tl;dr - knowing what capitalism will do in general != knowing what capitalism will do in particular That fact that you say "that's allowed" is why I am not an anarcho-capitalist, because that's quite possibly the most anarcho-capitalist response I can imagine. Yes, you've got the right answer to the question "what should government do about it" by answering "nothing", but you haven't answered the questions like "what is the best way to organize our efforts and resources to achieve this goal we all have?"

lol, get off your moral high horse; you pretend mutualism doesn't also impose an ethos.

&amp;gt;Mutual aid is something you participate in, not something you receive or give.

Appropriating past substantial homesteading merely because it's being presently used by someone different is *not* mutual aid, champ.

&amp;gt;Anarcho-capitalists have an incomplete understanding of property that obstructs the realization of justice

What self-referential drivel.

&amp;gt;an aggressor for violating that understanding of property

We all do this; it is inescapable.

&amp;gt;Anarcho-capitalists have rigged the rules of the game to favor anarcho-capitalism, and to exclude all others, and then they complain when their competitors break the rules.

These are called value-judgments, buddy, just like left-libertarians "rig the game" by defining "Justice" as they do.

&amp;gt;Thinking that you have found the one truth that provides the context in which all that is possible within concerns of justice may take place

It's amusing you have no problem applying this razor to other's views, but not your own. &amp;gt; If you are interested to hear the arguments against it, anarcho-capitalists are bad at identifying injustice. The are entire categories of injustice that anarcho-capitalists are unable or unwilling to recognize or understand. Ancaps have very poor and peculiar understandings of concepts so central to their framework of thought as voluntariness, property, and aggression. They tend to ignore historical aggression's role in creating the property relations that exist today and assume them as a baseline of justice. They also tend to assume that every replacement for a government service is of the general form of "Customers purchase services from company in free market", because this is how capitalism works. Cooperative solutions, such as "individuals gather together for mutual aid to provide services they all benefit from" are wholly ignored. The extent to which anarcho-capitalists explicitly favor mutual aid is the extent to which they insist that market transactions always leave both transacting parties better off. They generally entirely ignore mutual aid relationships which do not take a market transaction format.

All of the things you mention are *allowed* under anarcho-capitalism. Most of the ancaps with whom I speak are very in favor of charity and aid. The ancap authors all cite non-state welfare, such as the Amish system.

Would you try to stifle an anarcho-capitalist society? Most anarcho-capitalists think *any* society is fine, so long as the individuals consent to it. I find anyone who can agree to live peacefully alongside my society to be an ally. "Allowed under anarcho-capitalism"; so basically, presupposing everything from the baseline of your own particular framework. Or, put bluntly, taking all of your assumptions for granted. "You can have communes, just as long as you respect our property!*" 


*provided you don't squat on the thousand acres I claim ownership over! &amp;gt; provided you don't squat on the thousand acres I claim ownership over!

No anarcho-capitalist views claims on undeveloped land as legitimate. The vast majority of land in this world is undeveloped, so communes should not have a problem forming.

You don't have to respect my property; you just need to realize I will use force to protect it. Likewise, I don't give two shits what the North Korean government does, so long as they don't come to my house/work and harm me. I realize I can't open a McDonald's there,  even on undeveloped land, but I don't feel like their state violates my rights because I do not interact with it. Honestly, if it weren't for the media, I would have no idea that North Korea existed.

My critique was much more along the lines of Zhwazi's supposed rejection of anarcho-capitalism, while s/he does not reject any central tenets of anarcho-capitalism. S/he just seems to reject the goals that many anarcho-capitalists have, which are to ensure a personal profit and increase efficiency in society. Voluntary charity, voluntary mutual aid, and the like do not go against anything that any anarcho-capitalist has ever said. &amp;gt; No anarcho-capitalist views claims on undeveloped land as legitimate.

You would be surprised how often ancaps disagree, believing that holding onto undeveloped land as a speculator is within the legitimate property rights a person has and is central to rational economic calculation.

&amp;gt; You don't have to respect my property; you just need to realize I will use force to protect it.

Property is a question of right, not of might, and making it the latter undermines property entirely.

I am male. 

I specifically did not reject anything I considered fundamental to anarcho-capitalism. I do reject things I consider central, such as the NAP and self-ownership. These things are not fundamental to anarcho-capitalism (and I consider them to be useless, circular layers, respectively saying "bad things are bad" and "I own what I own because I own it"). What is fundamental is the basic idea that individuals are the real moral agents, that no individual or group of them has any natural privilege over any other, that all people are equal, and that they can own things. It doesn't matter if you believe in natural law or utilitarian or egoist justifications. They all begin with these presuppositions. 

I do not reject goals like personal profit and increasing efficiency. They are just not primary concerns. No amount of injustice is worth greater profit. No loss of liberty is worth greater efficiency. Even if the whole world could be made better under the dictatorial rule of an omniscient AI, I would reject it in defense of individual liberty and justice. To explicitly favor profit and efficiency as if they were goals necessary to anarcho-capitalism is essentially to say that anarcho-capitalists would accept slavery and aggression if it would make them better off. I hope that no anarcho-capitalist would find that acceptable. In my mind, it would disqualify you from being an anarcho-capitalist if you did. You would be a tentative anti-statist, at best. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; You don't have to respect my property; you just need to realize I will use force to protect it.

&amp;gt; Property is a question of right, not of might, and making it the latter undermines property entirely.

I agree, property rights are true rights. However, property rights are peculiar in that you hold them against the *entire world* so that no one should be able to interfere with such rights. This can be problematic when two groups or individuals disagree on the definition of property rights. As far as I can tell, people will disagree over property rights for eternity. Therefore, to a large degree, property rights are only meaningful because people use force to protect them. 

If several large anarcho-capitalist societies formed, I would move to one and then stop caring about the taxes in the United States because, although I still find them to be illegitimate, I recognize that others have a different view on property that doesn't affect me whatsoever. I would also recognize that the United States would use force against me if I squatted on their national parks, which are illegitimate forms of property because the land is undeveloped.

&amp;gt; I specifically did not reject anything I considered fundamental to anarcho-capitalism. I do reject things I consider central, such as the NAP and self-ownership.

Self-ownership is absolutely fundamental to anarcho-capitalism because self-ownership is a subset of property rights. "Allowed under anarcho-capitalism"; so basically, presupposing everything from the baseline of your own particular framework. Or, put bluntly, taking all of your assumptions for granted. "You can have communes, just as long as you respect our property!*" 


*provided you don't squat on the thousand acres I claim ownership over! I was an ancap probably three or four months after I realized I was a libertarian and continued learning about it. About 6 months after that, even though I was still basically an ancap, I dropped the "cap" half of it, and just called myself an anarchist, and was ambivalent about capitalism, finding it generally was an unclear term.

I moved on to agorism (the movement, not the tactic), which had a much more compatiblistic approach to libertarian socialists, and made efforts to understand libertarian socialism using anarcho-capitalist frameworks of thought rather than simply disparage it as unrealistic, stupid, and economically bankrupt as the mainstream anarcho-capitalists were doing.

As I began to understand libertarian socialism better, I began to be persuaded by it, and eventually started seeing shortcomings in anarcho-capitalism. It isn't that anarcho-capitalism is really wrong, because what I believe is truly important to genuine anarcho-capitalists is still true, anarcho-capitalism just began to look incomplete.

Not calling myself an anarcho-capitalist is more of me taking issue with the anarcho-capitalist orthodoxy and what I see as some unhelpful capitalist-centric rhetoric than me being separated from it. I do have large disagreements, but my disagreements come from expanding upon the insights that I gained as an anarcho-capitalist, not from the disproving of those insights.

At the moment, I generally identify as an agoristic mutualist. The historical anarchist who best represents my views is Benjamin Tucker, the individualist anarchist. So I am somewhere in that range of views, opposed to capitalism as I understand it but not an advocate of communism as I understand it.

They generally entirely ignore mutual aid relationships which do not take a market transaction format.

Ancaps also seem to spend inordinate amounts of time trying to recreate the state under explicit contract or property. Heathian anarchism, where one landowner acts as a state, a position advocated by Hoppe, is basically the same as a state with the exception that the property right in territory is legitimate according to libertarian standards. Other forms attempt to regenerate law under explicit contract, such as rulership by the insurance/DRO/PDA complex, who will let you buy law enforcement and through mutual agreements between themselves and their adherents create a network of contract to develop explicit law, but who have no institutional or legal reason not to simply kill people who do not subscribe to the services of any PDA in their network. These forms of society are as antithetical to liberty as the state if they come to dominate, they are just within the bounds of libertarian understandings of voluntariness and consent. What these forms really seem to be, in my view, are ways to explain to statists, how to have restriction and authoritarianism by consent rather than through aggression.

While a society without aggression is a good thing to pursue, doing so in ways that restrict human freedom and liberty is not a satisfying solution to many of us. Anarcho-capitalists become so preoccupied with consent that they have lost sight of freedom. I believe that a truly free society can only be developed from legally independent individuals cooperating to the extent possible, peacefully competing to the extent necessary, helping each other to the extent they find comfortable, but generally minimizing their contractual or social obligations to one another, building a society on continuing mutual benefit rather than adversarial contract and trade, fostering a culture of self-sufficiency and enriching hobbies and creative play that leaves more people in a position to offer help than in a position to need it. This system is not the one envisioned by anarcho-capitalists generally, though it is not one mutually exclusive with the fundamental tenets of anarcho-capitalism either. I still can't call myself an anarcho-capitalist because distinctly non-capitalist arrangements more closely approximate my views.

I hope this helps explain my views. I enjoy reading Tucker... especially once he accepted egoism. Do you agree with Tucker that "capitalism is at least tolerable, which cannot be said of communism and socialism"?

What work of his do you think was most influential to you? Or would you say that you came to your own conclusions and Tucker happens to best represent them?

Although I have not seen you say it, I would guess you think people can own capital and let others use it without losing their "right" to own it. I am guessing the user will simply pay rent to the capital owner? This does sound very Tuckerite-ish.

What disagreements do you have with Carson? &amp;gt; Do you agree with Tucker that "capitalism is at least tolerable, which cannot be said of communism and socialism"?

For the definitions of communism and socialism he used in that phrase, yes. His meanings there are most closely resemblant to the ancap definitions of those words. At other times he called himself a socialist, his "State Socialism and Anarchism" he defended anarchism as a wing of socialism, just a decidedly anti-authoritarian one. He never did have anything good to say about communism, and I'm slightly inclined to agree, though the anarcho-communists who I have spoken with have been pretty clear that nobody is forced into participation in a commune or federation. Anarcho-communism seems to have been coming to its own around the time that Tucker was busy in the US, but in a country halfway around the world, so I don't know that his judgement of communism is applicable to anarcho-communism, though I suspect he'd still not consider it preferable. Capitalism is at least relatively limited in its scope, which state socialism and communism are not. However, its tolerability is not it's justness.

&amp;gt; What work of his do you think was most influential to you? Or would you say that you came to your own conclusions and Tucker happens to best represent them?

The latter. I have started reading "Instead of a Book" and agree with almost everything he says. I came to the same conclusions on land mostly on my own (though ironically was first exposed to geoism by a troll using the name "bentucker" on a forum I frequented).

&amp;gt; Although I have not seen you say it, I would guess you think people can own capital and let others use it without losing their "right" to own it. I am guessing the user will simply pay rent to the capital owner? This does sound very Tuckerite-ish.

If the user pays rent to the capital owner than I see it as a similar condition where the renter would be gradually losing their property right in the thing rented over time. My reasoning for this isn't as clear or easily explained as it is with capitalist employers, but the general trend is the same. I reserve the right to retreat from this position if I'm unable to explain it to my own satisfaction.

&amp;gt; What disagreements do you have with Carson?

Not many that I know of. I think his defense of the labor theory of value could probably use a dose of labor theory of property mixed in, given that labor creates value and property right simultaneously and to the same extent as one another, the extent to which you own something is the extent to which you have improved it, the extent to which you have improved it is generally evaluated by the owner's subjective wants and needs. That's not really a disagreement though, just perhaps an incompleteness or expansion that there is room for. He's pretty insightful in general. He often describes himself as an individualist also, and Benjamin Tucker's image is the cover of "Mutualist Political Economy". I was an ancap probably three or four months after I realized I was a libertarian and continued learning about it. About 6 months after that, even though I was still basically an ancap, I dropped the "cap" half of it, and just called myself an anarchist, and was ambivalent about capitalism, finding it generally was an unclear term.

I believe that a truly free society can only be developed from legally independent individuals cooperating to the extent possible, peacefully competing to the extent necessary, helping each other to the extent they find comfortable, but generally minimizing their contractual or social obligations to one another, building a society on continuing mutual benefit rather than adversarial contract and trade, fostering a culture of self-sufficiency and enriching hobbies and creative play that leaves more people in a position to offer help than in a position to need it. This system is not the one envisioned by anarcho-capitalists generally, though it is not one mutually exclusive with the fundamental tenets of anarcho-capitalism either. I still can't call myself an anarcho-capitalist because distinctly non-capitalist arrangements more closely approximate my views.

I hope this helps explain my views.  The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). That's only an issue if you subscribe to the *ad coelum* doctrine which holds that when you own land, you own it all the way to the center of the Earth and out to an ever expanding cone into space. That's false though. You don't own anything near the core of the Earth because you've never been there. If you own land on the surface, I can tunnel under you. I simply have to dig deep enough so as to not cause your land to cave in.

We live in three dimensions. Even if all land on the surface were owned (not even close) we can still build up and down. There's plenty of room. &amp;gt;We live in three dimensions.

Ahem. Three spatial dimensions, pedant. That we can perceive.

I also go by dickhead. There are also no unicorns, that we can perceive. Nice to meet you, dickhead. I'm NghtRppr. It's not as ridiculous to believe in other dimensions as it is to believe in unicorns.  A lot of mainstream mathematical models of the universe posit that there are more spatial dimensions than the ones we can perceive.   That's only an issue if you subscribe to the *ad coelum* doctrine which holds that when you own land, you own it all the way to the center of the Earth and out to an ever expanding cone into space. That's false though. You don't own anything near the core of the Earth because you've never been there. If you own land on the surface, I can tunnel under you. I simply have to dig deep enough so as to not cause your land to cave in.

We live in three dimensions. Even if all land on the surface were owned (not even close) we can still build up and down. There's plenty of room. What about airspace? I'd think you could infer his position on that as well.  As long as I don't fly so low over your house as to disrupt your use of your property, we're good.  If you build a tower into the sky, you've homesteaded that portion of sky.  I haven't the right to fly my plane into your building. What about airspace? The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). Geolibertarian then?  The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). The problem of [land monopoly](http://www.grundskyld.dk/2-churchill-uk.html). "land is the original source of all wealth". I stopped reading after that. The human mind is the original source of all wealth, land has no intrinsic value. It only has value if it's used by man.  I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

Pinpointing all of the reasons why this is so would require a post of greater volume and depth than I have time for at the present, but I'll do my best to sum up my primary objections.

I suppose the most basic reason that I reject the concept is that capitalism (defined here simply as "an institutional ideology which emphasizes the role of capital ownership in determining the distribution of goods") offer any positive position for the elimination hierarchy. In fact, it more often than not offers *defenses* of hierarchy, which is difficult to square with the historical anarchist analysis that hierarchy, to put a spin on an old anarchist adage, is the mother of tyranny. This is part and parcel with the AnCap habit of suggesting that if an arrangement is nominally "voluntary", it is by definition *just*-- which I find objectionable for some obvious reasons: if I "voluntarily" entered your house, the mere fact I have done so doesn't imply that I've accepted all of the assumptions that might come with it (do you have a right to kill me? If you acknowledge you don't, then you acknowledge that at the very least there are conceptual limits to "property" as it is often used by AnCaps).

I find that the arguments for market reductionism (i.e. "This problem exists because of State intervention! The market could solve it!") aren't very convincing, and typically regress into a poor defense of existing markets. While it is undeniable a great deal of problems faced by society stem from the State, it cannot be denied that it's counterparts, Organized Religion and Capitalism, have played roles just as great in shaping the existing world we live in. Even if we accept that the market could plausibly offer solutions that might otherwise be difficult to achieve, the AnCap habit of coloring all problems as necessarily being because the market lacks complete elasticity really doesn't help it out, and often times ends up confusing the debate. A good example of this is when people like Brad Spangler unequivocally state "Rothbardian Capitalism is Libertarian Socialism" (this is so fucking flawed from the start) or suggesting that a mutual aid organization is in fact a market organization, which sort of leaves one incredulous-- how can an organization premised in absolute equality for all participants permit profit?

I'm also unconvinced that the typical AnCap vision of property would last in a genuinely liberated society. Even if we take for granted most assumptions AnCaps make -- that DRO's/PDA's/Pigs/Whatever will be prolific, that private courts would assume the roles of existing courts, and that absentee forms of property would be respected -- it does not really leave much of a positive situation to work from. Let me explain: 

For the sake of argument, let's imagine you *legitimately* sit atop a four acre plot of land which you claim ownership over, and immediately adjacent to your east is a four acre wooded lot which you only intermittently use (wood, foraging, small game hunting), but nonetheless believe is your property.

Now let us imagine that squatters end up pitching camp on the land you foraged and hunted from. You, believing that it is your property, do your best to evict them without having to resort to violence (it must be noted here that there can be no strong objection to characterizing evictions as violence; there can be nothing peaceful about physically removing people from their shelter or home, no matter how the property relations are framed), but it seems that nothing can be done to ultimately prevent them from coming back without resorting to violence that cannot be undone or without incurring such a great cost to yourself where you would drive yourself into debt (because as is often pointed out by AnCaps, violence is *expensive*). You, in your frustration, turn to a private court to help solve the matter. It is here that a crucial note should be taken: no vision of property is self-evident. The court, then, has to decide which framework of property it would apply: does it apply the possession and use standard preferred by the squatters? Or does it apply the absentee property theory favored by you?

If the court favors the standard of possession and use, you, their client, would likely turn away from their service. Additionally, it would help set a cultural precedent of possession and use, wherein future situations similar to yours would not be found to have much in the way of merit. At this point, the proposition of defending your claim without sinking yourself into debt makes it virtually impractical to hold any faith in the concept of absentee ownership. But what if the court should decide in your favor? Indeed, it seems more plausible that such an outcome might be found considering the precedent they would set for themselves: by legitimizing the evictions of squatters today, they create the very real possibility that they would use that same legitimizing power to evict more squatters in a cycle of continuing to generate revenue while favoring a vision of property that specifically effects their bottom line. And what of the costs of enforcement of that eviction? You would likely have to pay premiums to the thugs you hired to evict the squatters, which is going to come out of your pocket. And what if squatters keep returning? Either one must accept that their vision of property simply isn't tenable, or that they must constantly turn to an institution to enforce that claim, which is likely to become so astronomically expensive as to drive most subscribers of any such system into debt peonage. We are left, in many ways, with a situation not unlike what exists today excepting several cosmetic differences.

Finally, I suppose my cultural inclinations also had something to do with my resulting disillusion. I often find that AnCaps have not let go of many of their prejudices, particularly as it might relate to those who they consider "leeches"; I am addressing specifically here their penchant for treating those who collect infinitesimally small amounts from the State as if they were necessarily the source of our problems; I am addressing here the treatment of people of color, single parents collecting welfare, and working class. Though it may be frustrating that these people often support the programs which end up hurting them, they don't support it out of "laziness" or whatever characterizations AnCaps want to use, but out of the fact that so many of their options have been *destroyed* by a system that looks at them as inputs to be exploited.

So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections. &amp;gt;defined here simply as "an institutional ideology which emphasizes the role of capital ownership in determining the distribution of goods"

Does any ancap support this? If not, what does it have to do with anarcho-capitalism? And what is an institutional ideology?

&amp;gt;if I "voluntarily" entered your house, the mere fact I have done so doesn't imply that I've accepted all of the assumptions that might come with it (do you have a right to kill me? If you acknowledge you don't, then you acknowledge that at the very least there are conceptual limits to "property" as it is often used by AnCaps).

I have never met an ancap that supports the right to kill your visitors as you please. If someone doesn't obey your rules while visiting your home, you have the right to ask them to leave. If they refuse to leave, then you have the right to use force to get them out of your house. Have you ever met such an ancap? If not, why do you bring it up?

&amp;gt;the AnCap habit of coloring all problems as necessarily being because the market lacks complete elasticity really doesn't help it out, and often times ends up confusing the debate.

Who does this? This sounds more like a strawman argument against neoclassical economists, who wouldn't make that case either...

&amp;gt;A good example of this is when people like Brad Spangler unequivocally state "Rothbardian Capitalism is Libertarian Socialism" (this is so fucking flawed from the start) or suggesting that a mutual aid organization is in fact a market organization

Since Austrians tend to define markets as the sum of all voluntary trade, how are mutual aid organizations not market organizations? And don't say "Well I define markets as..." because that is completely irrelevant to the question.

&amp;gt;how can an organization premised in absolute equality for all participants permit profit?

Monetary profits are not a prerequisite for markets. 

Regarding your long story of a land ownership conflict, ancaps have different views on land ownership. I don't support lockean land ownership and I don't support occupancy and use. I have had long discussions with mutualists about this and they have also agreed that this sort of thing would be dealt with through compromise and dialogue between the affected parties. Because the problem is as much the squatters' as it is the lockean landowners'. You can just as well turn the question around and ask "how would the mutualists solve this problem?". And I would like to ask you. How would you solve land owership disputes?

&amp;gt;So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections.

And I believe your view of anarcho-capitalists should have no influence over your opinion on anarcho-capitalism. Neither should its degree of "true anarchism-ness". You cannot criticize anarcho-capitalism by pointing fingers at anarcho-capitalists. Especially when you don't point it at anyone in particular, but at a bunch of strawmen. I don't know where to start, to be perfectly honest. Do I open up with how the entire point of the thread was to explain my own personal reasons for why I became dissatisfied, and that my reasons were shaped by years of living with, interacting with, and *being* an anarcho-capitalist? 

Do I point out that, through-out your response, you ask questions like:

&amp;gt;Does any ancap support this?

and

&amp;gt;I have never met an ancap that supports the right to kill your visitors as you please.

but nonetheless feel compelled to try and make an issue of what exactly it is I feel about anarcho-capitalists. If this weren't about the people, but were about the ideas, why are you asking me "what AnCap believes this"? Why aren't you simply addressing the issue at hand instead of making a big show for your peers in an attempt to make it look as if I am only here to mischaracterize AnCaps so you can dismiss it without any substantive input on your part?

It is pretty evident that you take yourself pretty seriously, but not seriously enough to keep a lock down on your knee-jerking. This much is made clear by your selection of passages in which you feel you can try and make it appear I'm strawmanning AnCaps; but unless you're ready to denounce Block and Hoppe, who have made unequivocal defenses of the alleged right of a homeowner to execute a "trespasser". Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the logical conclusions of propertarianism (i.e. absolute authority over one's claimed property is justification for execution if so willed) it might mean it really isn't all that phenomenal of an idea and recognize (though will not admit) that there are conceptual limits to the ideas of property and authority.

I *don't* think you're here to better understand why I bailed on anarcho-capitalism, but instead try and make yourself look good in front of your equally ill informed and ill mannered peers. When you write things like

&amp;gt;Since Austrians tend to define markets as the sum of all voluntary trade, how are mutual aid organizations not market organizations? And don't say "Well I define markets as..." because that is completely irrelevant to the question.

it sort of leaves one to wonder just how stupid you believe your audience is. Why is it that the Austrian "tendency" (i.e., not a formal phenomena, but merely an observation of a trend) of definition is inscrutable here? Why is it that my own personal definition is meaningless, while the "tendency" of the Austrians is unquestionable? In other words, why are you insisting that we limit the conversation to strictly to your definitions and exclude all others? It would be pretty easy to sum up that particular passage as "Mises said it, I believe it, that settles it."

If you think repeating the mantra "the market will solve it!" is any more substantive than the claim "the State will fix it", you really haven't departed that much from authoritarian thinking at all. Suggesting that the market, in it's vaguely monolithic crowd-wisdom glory, is "the sum total of all voluntary trade" means that market institutions *aren't* formed on the basis of mutuality-- i.e., the motive is profit, not social security.

Wrapping this up, I don't think you fully understand the enormity of what my "land problem" really was dealing with. It isn't simply a matter of "how disputes will solved", but "if disputes are solved by paid institutions, what incentive exists to prevent them from acting in their rational self-interest of maximizing their return by favoring only visions of property which require evictions? How will this not devolve into debt peonage to those enforcing institutions? How does this not reflect the fundamental arrangement between State and Society today?" Re-think it, if you like. &amp;gt;but nonetheless feel compelled to try and make an issue of what exactly it is I feel about anarcho-capitalists. If this weren't about the people, but were about the ideas, why are you asking me "what AnCap believes this"? Why aren't you simply addressing the issue at hand instead of making a big show for your peers in an attempt to make it look as if I am only here to mischaracterize AnCaps so you can dismiss it without any substantive input on your part?

I understand your criticism. However, if I have been unable to find any ancap that holds your position, among my peers and among prominent ancap authors, I would like to know where you got your impression that the things you point out have anything to do with anarcho-capitalism.

&amp;gt;It is pretty evident that you take yourself pretty seriously, but not seriously enough to keep a lock down on your knee-jerking. This much is made clear by your selection of passages in which you feel you can try and make it appear I'm strawmanning AnCaps; but unless you're ready to denounce Block and Hoppe, who have made unequivocal defenses of the alleged right of a homeowner to execute a "trespasser". Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the logical conclusions of propertarianism (i.e. absolute authority over one's claimed property is justification for execution if so willed) it might mean it really isn't all that phenomenal of an idea and recognize (though will not admit) that there are conceptual limits to the ideas of property and authority.

First of all, I don't call myself an anarcho-capitalist. This isn't some kind of knee-jerk response to someone criticizing my position, because it isn't my position. I don't know about Hoppe, but Block based his entire argument for evictionism on the idea that you are *not* allowed to kill someone just because you don't want him on your property. I think he made the case that you only should have the right to escort unwanted people off your property in the gentlest manner possible, using as little force as needed. And this was of course to oppose the right to kill a baby because it is in your body, which is your property, if it is possible to evict it without killing it.

&amp;gt;Additionally, if you're not comfortable with the logical conclusions of propertarianism (i.e. absolute authority over one's claimed property is justification for execution if so willed) it might mean it really isn't all that phenomenal of an idea and recognize (though will not admit) that there are conceptual limits to the ideas of property and authority.

I don't think anyone here supports propertarianism as you define it. Whether or not it is just to use force to defend property depends on whether that property was justly acquired. Just claiming it is not enough. And what constitutes just property differs depending on who you ask. And of course you must be allowed to use force to defend your property, and lethal force if absolutely necessary. Otherwise it isn't property. Otherwise it's up for grabs.

&amp;gt;it sort of leaves one to wonder just how stupid you believe your audience is. Why is it that the Austrian "tendency" (i.e., not a formal phenomena, but merely an observation of a trend) of definition is inscrutable here? Why is it that my own personal definition is meaningless, while the "tendency" of the Austrians is unquestionable? In other words, why are you insisting that we limit the conversation to strictly to your definitions and exclude all others? It would be pretty easy to sum up that particular passage as "Mises said it, I believe it, that settles it."

I think you misinterpreted my point. My point isn't that one definition is correct and another definition is wrong. All definitions are made arbitrarily by men. The point is that we need to use *the same* definitions, no matter what those definitions are, if we ever want to carry out any form of meaningful exchange. If you are criticizing someone else's argument, you should do it using the definitions that person used. In other words, you should criticize what he means, not what words he uses. It is a very common tendency among anarchists on the left, such as mutualists, to be fully aware of what Austrians mean by "market" or "capitalism", but still criticize them by applying their own definitions. But they don't support your definition of the concept they claimed to support. They support their own. So if you want to criticize their position. Criticize it using their definitions.

And this is again not a knee-jerk reaction, because I don't even consider myself an Austrian. I adhere to the neoclassical school of microeconomics. So your "Mises said it, that settles it" point is completely false.

&amp;gt;Suggesting that the market, in it's vaguely monolithic crowd-wisdom glory, is "the sum total of all voluntary trade" means that market institutions aren't formed on the basis of mutuality-- i.e., the motive is profit, not social security.

You can trade for profit and you can trade for security. Not sure what you are trying to say here.

&amp;gt;Wrapping this up, I don't think you fully understand the enormity of what my "land problem" really was dealing with. It isn't simply a matter of "how disputes will solved", but "if disputes are solved by paid institutions, what incentive exists to prevent them from acting in their rational self-interest of maximizing their return by favoring only visions of property which require evictions? How will this not devolve into debt peonage to those enforcing institutions? How does this not reflect the fundamental arrangement between State and Society today?" Re-think it, if you like.

I have thought a lot about land. It is an extremely important question. Personally, I oppose land ownership alltogether and think that both the lockean and occupancy and use positions are inadequate. So I don't feel obliged to defend the lockean position. I am interested in hearing your solutions to the problems with lockean land ownership though. What are YOUR enforcing institutions? What are they driven by? Will they not act on their rational self-interest? I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

Pinpointing all of the reasons why this is so would require a post of greater volume and depth than I have time for at the present, but I'll do my best to sum up my primary objections.

Though it may be frustrating that these people often support the programs which end up hurting them, they don't support it out of "laziness" or whatever characterizations AnCaps want to use, but out of the fact that so many of their options have been *destroyed* by a system that looks at them as inputs to be exploited.

So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections. &amp;gt; I suppose the most basic reason that I reject the concept is that capitalism (defined here simply as "an institutional ideology which emphasizes the role of capital ownership in determining the distribution of goods") offer any positive position for the elimination hierarchy. 

Why do you want to eliminate hierarchy? How do you define hierarchy?

If you define hierarchy as ability to influence, anarcho-capitalists realize that different individuals will have different degrees of influence on us; this influence is not illegitimate. Because of my social relationship with my parents, they can influence me to a greater degree than you can. Because billionaires can provide me with a mansion and lifetime supply of food, Bill Gates has a greater influence on me than does a homeless person.

Furthermore, the only monopolies in existence are government-created monopolies (e.g. only Apple can sell iPads). Therefore, under anarcho-capitalism, no individual can absolutely deny any other individual a good or service.

&amp;gt; Even if we accept that the market could plausibly offer solutions that might otherwise be difficult to achieve, the AnCap habit of coloring all problems as necessarily being because the market lacks complete elasticity really doesn't help it out, and often times ends up confusing the debate.

No ancaps theorize a Utopian society under anarcho-capitalism. Ancaps just think the society will be more ethical than our current ones.

&amp;gt; Now let us imagine that squatters end up pitching camp on the land you foraged and hunted from. You, believing that it is your property, do your best to evict them without having to resort to violence (it must be noted here that there can be no strong objection to characterizing evictions as violence; there can be nothing peaceful about physically removing people from their shelter or home, no matter how the property relations are framed)

There is a very plausible solution to evict people without violence. You send out a notice to the public that squatters are on your land, then the community stops trading with them. The squatters will run out of food or water and will have to leave within the near future. I do not assert this solution to work 100% of the time, but it is a reasonable, nonviolent solution.

&amp;gt; If the court favors the standard of possession and use, you, their client, would likely turn away from their service. Additionally, it would help set a cultural precedent of possession and use, wherein future situations similar to yours would not be found to have much in the way of merit. At this point, the proposition of defending your claim without sinking yourself into debt makes it virtually impractical to hold any faith in the concept of absentee ownership. But what if the court should decide in your favor? Indeed, it seems more plausible that such an outcome might be found considering the precedent they would set for themselves: by legitimizing the evictions of squatters today, they create the very real possibility that they would use that same legitimizing power to evict more squatters in a cycle of continuing to generate revenue while favoring a vision of property that specifically effects their bottom line. And what of the costs of enforcement of that eviction? You would likely have to pay premiums to the thugs you hired to evict the squatters, which is going to come out of your pocket. And what if squatters keep returning? Either one must accept that their vision of property simply isn't tenable, or that they must constantly turn to an institution to enforce that claim, which is likely to become so astronomically expensive as to drive most subscribers of any such system into debt peonage. We are left, in many ways, with a situation not unlike what exists today excepting several cosmetic differences.

Most an-caps realize that one universal truth to these disputes does not exist and local courts will vary in their opinions; local courts will come to an efficient outcome.

The cost of litigation should not be too great and will not make anyone go broke. The DRO/etc. would send out an inspector to report to a judge, which would actually be quite inexpensive. If we assume such costs were distributed throughout all of the members of the DRO *and* we assume that the total court/jail costs are comparable to those today in the United States (but, cut in half because half of those costs are spent on drug related crimes) then the cost of a DRO would be quite affordable.

&amp;gt; Finally, I suppose my cultural inclinations also had something to do with my resulting disillusion. I often find that AnCaps have not let go of many of their prejudices, particularly as it might relate to those who they consider "leeches"; I am addressing specifically here their penchant for treating those who collect infinitesimally small amounts from the State as if they were necessarily the source of our problems; I am addressing here the treatment of people of color, single parents collecting welfare, and working class. Though it may be frustrating that these people often support the programs which end up hurting them, they don't support it out of "laziness" or whatever characterizations AnCaps want to use, but out of the fact that so many of their options have been destroyed by a system that looks at them as inputs to be exploited.

The ancaps I know only consider the government to be a leech. We view government's huge stake in land (~40% of land in the United States) as the greatest factor preventing the poor from accessing affordable housing, and for that reason we feel sorry for the government's tragic effect on the poor. &amp;gt;Why do you want to eliminate hierarchy? How do you define hierarchy?

I want to eliminate hierarchy because it is 1.) a manifestation of authoritarianism (which is the antithesis of libertarianism, the basic ethical framework of anarchism) and 2.) it is inefficient. I define hierarchy as the institutional and/or cultural arrangement in which decision making power is alienated from those who make up a particular relationship or set of social relationships.

&amp;gt;If you define hierarchy as ability to influence, anarcho-capitalists realize that different individuals will have different degrees of influence on us; this influence is not illegitimate. 

Hierarchy as it is related to anarchist analysis is actually pretty well-explored topic, and isn't at all related to "influence"; it refers to a specific social arrangement in which one has unequal power in decision making processes as related to all other human components of that process. I strongly suggest you maybe read some Situationist and Anti-Organization articles, as they would give you a pretty good insight of just how far anarchism takes the anti-hierarchy train (spoiler: no stops).

&amp;gt;There is a very plausible solution to evict people without violence. You send out a notice to the public that squatters are on your land, then the community stops trading with them. The squatters will run out of food or water and will have to leave within the near future. I do not assert this solution to work 100% of the time, but it is a reasonable, nonviolent solution.

I think we can agree then, if this were the case, that evictions have no teeth, and there is nothing to stop people from squatting atop absentee owned land. There is nothing preventing a member of the community from defecting and interacting with these people; there is nothing stopping these people from making their own gardens and raising their own stock; in other words, if you can't enforce it with violence, it ain't gonna make a lick of a difference how much you go on about how it is yours.

&amp;gt;The cost of litigation should not be too great and will not make anyone go broke. The DRO/etc. would send out an inspector to report to a judge, which would actually be quite inexpensive. If we assume such costs were distributed throughout all of the members of the DRO and we assume that the total court/jail costs are comparable to those today in the United States (but, cut in half because half of those costs are spent on drug related crimes) then the cost of a DRO would be quite affordable.

I call BS. You can't know what the costs will be in a genuinely liberated market; but what we *do* know that is in *any societal arrangement, violence is expensive*. I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

Pinpointing all of the reasons why this is so would require a post of greater volume and depth than I have time for at the present, but I'll do my best to sum up my primary objections.

I suppose the most basic reason that I reject the concept is that capitalism (defined here simply as "an institutional ideology which emphasizes the role of capital ownership in determining the distribution of goods") offer any positive position for the elimination hierarchy. In fact, it more often than not offers *defenses* of hierarchy, which is difficult to square with the historical anarchist analysis that hierarchy, to put a spin on an old anarchist adage, is the mother of tyranny. This is part and parcel with the AnCap habit of suggesting that if an arrangement is nominally "voluntary", it is by definition *just*-- which I find objectionable for some obvious reasons: if I "voluntarily" entered your house, the mere fact I have done so doesn't imply that I've accepted all of the assumptions that might come with it (do you have a right to kill me? If you acknowledge you don't, then you acknowledge that at the very least there are conceptual limits to "property" as it is often used by AnCaps).

I find that the arguments for market reductionism (i.e. "This problem exists because of State intervention! The market could solve it!") aren't very convincing, and typically regress into a poor defense of existing markets. While it is undeniable a great deal of problems faced by society stem from the State, it cannot be denied that it's counterparts, Organized Religion and Capitalism, have played roles just as great in shaping the existing world we live in. Even if we accept that the market could plausibly offer solutions that might otherwise be difficult to achieve, the AnCap habit of coloring all problems as necessarily being because the market lacks complete elasticity really doesn't help it out, and often times ends up confusing the debate. A good example of this is when people like Brad Spangler unequivocally state "Rothbardian Capitalism is Libertarian Socialism" (this is so fucking flawed from the start) or suggesting that a mutual aid organization is in fact a market organization, which sort of leaves one incredulous-- how can an organization premised in absolute equality for all participants permit profit?

I'm also unconvinced that the typical AnCap vision of property would last in a genuinely liberated society. Even if we take for granted most assumptions AnCaps make -- that DRO's/PDA's/Pigs/Whatever will be prolific, that private courts would assume the roles of existing courts, and that absentee forms of property would be respected -- it does not really leave much of a positive situation to work from. Let me explain: 

For the sake of argument, let's imagine you *legitimately* sit atop a four acre plot of land which you claim ownership over, and immediately adjacent to your east is a four acre wooded lot which you only intermittently use (wood, foraging, small game hunting), but nonetheless believe is your property.

Now let us imagine that squatters end up pitching camp on the land you foraged and hunted from. You, believing that it is your property, do your best to evict them without having to resort to violence (it must be noted here that there can be no strong objection to characterizing evictions as violence; there can be nothing peaceful about physically removing people from their shelter or home, no matter how the property relations are framed), but it seems that nothing can be done to ultimately prevent them from coming back without resorting to violence that cannot be undone or without incurring such a great cost to yourself where you would drive yourself into debt (because as is often pointed out by AnCaps, violence is *expensive*). You, in your frustration, turn to a private court to help solve the matter. It is here that a crucial note should be taken: no vision of property is self-evident. The court, then, has to decide which framework of property it would apply: does it apply the possession and use standard preferred by the squatters? Or does it apply the absentee property theory favored by you?

If the court favors the standard of possession and use, you, their client, would likely turn away from their service. Additionally, it would help set a cultural precedent of possession and use, wherein future situations similar to yours would not be found to have much in the way of merit. At this point, the proposition of defending your claim without sinking yourself into debt makes it virtually impractical to hold any faith in the concept of absentee ownership. But what if the court should decide in your favor? Indeed, it seems more plausible that such an outcome might be found considering the precedent they would set for themselves: by legitimizing the evictions of squatters today, they create the very real possibility that they would use that same legitimizing power to evict more squatters in a cycle of continuing to generate revenue while favoring a vision of property that specifically effects their bottom line. And what of the costs of enforcement of that eviction? You would likely have to pay premiums to the thugs you hired to evict the squatters, which is going to come out of your pocket. And what if squatters keep returning? Either one must accept that their vision of property simply isn't tenable, or that they must constantly turn to an institution to enforce that claim, which is likely to become so astronomically expensive as to drive most subscribers of any such system into debt peonage. We are left, in many ways, with a situation not unlike what exists today excepting several cosmetic differences.

Finally, I suppose my cultural inclinations also had something to do with my resulting disillusion. I often find that AnCaps have not let go of many of their prejudices, particularly as it might relate to those who they consider "leeches"; I am addressing specifically here their penchant for treating those who collect infinitesimally small amounts from the State as if they were necessarily the source of our problems; I am addressing here the treatment of people of color, single parents collecting welfare, and working class. Though it may be frustrating that these people often support the programs which end up hurting them, they don't support it out of "laziness" or whatever characterizations AnCaps want to use, but out of the fact that so many of their options have been *destroyed* by a system that looks at them as inputs to be exploited.

So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections. &amp;gt;Pinpointing all of the reasons why this is so would require a post of greater volume and depth than I have time for at the present

Still writes 1,200 words.

Your objections are pretty standard leftism.  You assuredly were the deontological variant of ancap.  I think, though, that if you were to do even further inspection, you'd realize that authority always exists and TRUE FREEDOM^TM is a meaningless concept; proposed systems can only merely reshape it.

Hence, propertarianism over tragedy of the commons becomes the deciding factor for me (and very extensive capital ownership rights, so its accumulation isn't retarded and funneled into demonstrably less desired places, regardless of the bellyaching by those with high time preferences). I'm a compulsive over-achiever.

EDIT RESPONSE:

&amp;gt;Your objections are pretty standard leftism. 

"Standard leftism"? Oh, brother. If the best you can respond to my objections is to simply characterize them as being "standard leftist", it is clear you don't have much to go on. After all, what is so objectionable about my objections?

&amp;gt;You assuredly were the deontological variant of ancap. 

No, I was a moral realist. Deonotology and consequentialism are both useful, but emphasizing one over the other only creates problems. My objections came after living in the Free State Project for some time, after immersing myself in AnCap culture and intellectual circles, after gaining a better understanding of the variety in ideologies that exist.

&amp;gt;I think, though, that if you were to do even further inspection, you'd realize that authority always exists; proposed systems can only merely reshape it.

Saying "authority always exists" is about as meaningful as saying "liberty always exists", and that one must simply reshape it. But this is false-- liberty and authority are antithetical. They cannot be reconciled, and any attempt leads only to dissonance.

&amp;gt;Hence, propertarianism over tragedy of the commons becomes the deciding factor for me.

Describe for me the tragedy of the commons and where it existed in history. Then, describe for me why it is the work of Elinor Ostrom (who pretty clearly explained why "tragedy of the commons" is a myth that only comes close to reality when you have *centralized authorities managing resources*; it's why she got the Nobel in economics, after all) doesn't hold up. &amp;gt;"Standard leftism"? Oh, brother.

I didn't say that necessarily disparagingly; I'm merely describing your views, and they *are* standard egalitarian, hyper"anti"authoritarian leftism.

&amp;gt;it is clear you don't have much to go on

I think it's clearer you don't understand exactly where I'm objecting.

&amp;gt;At this point, the proposition of defending your claim without sinking yourself into debt makes it virtually impractical to hold any faith in the concept of absentee ownership.

All such a thought experiment achieves is that weak homesteading claims don't stand up to higher ones; just because there are cases where absentee ownership is not granted does not categorically end its existence.

You're going to have to make a *hell of a lot* better consequentialist, economic argument than that.

&amp;gt;No, I was a moral realist.

That is moral realism; it is one of its many subsets.

&amp;gt;My objections came after living in the Free State Project for some time, after immersing myself in AnCap culture and intellectual circles, after gaining a better understanding of the variety in ideologies that exist.

Much of the FSP community biases heavily toward the *activist* sect of ancaps.  Some of us just look at it as a mindset in which to see the world more clearly, but still maintain much of our past life and other hobbies.

&amp;gt;Saying "authority always exists" is about as meaningful as saying "liberty always exists"

What's being said is that both always exist in different senses; neither has full, absolute meaning.  Authority in creating what is considered good and negating what is considered bad are also good, but it is still authority.

&amp;gt;"tragedy of the commons" is a myth that only comes close to reality when you have centralized authorities managing resources

Isn't this just defining the matter in such a way as to be inclusive of Austrian ancaps; can't the government be this centralized authority in "managing" resources by antagonizing the creation of private property rights? &amp;gt; Some of us just look at it as a mindset in which to see the world more clearly, but still maintain much of our past life and other hobbies.

In other words, you have no real intention of changing anything, particularly a system which virtually props up your way of life. I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

The Iron Law of Oligarchy will crush any anarchy that attempts to eliminate hierarchy.  It cannot be done.  You cannot eliminate the leader-follower aspect of life.  You can only remove the ability of a leader to become a ruler; to turn a voluntary relationship into a coercive one.

This is why most anarchists actually propose a hierarchy of the majority over the minority in direct democracy.  They're just apparently not willing to recognize that direct democracy means there is a *government*, and that inevitably some people will come to control that government.  Likely bureaucrats carrying out the "will of the people".

&amp;gt;if I "voluntarily" entered your house, the mere fact I have done so doesn't imply that I've accepted all of the assumptions that might come with it

If you voluntarily enter my house, you have accepted the assumptions that come with it.  To do otherwise is to say that it is not my house - that I have no right to exclude people from my living room.  Even most anarchists recognize the right to "personal property" such as this, and in doing so implicitly accept voluntary hierarchy regardless of their stance.

&amp;gt;a mutual aid organization is in fact a market organization, which sort of leaves one incredulous

The market, as defined by anarcho-capitalists, would include mutual aid organizations, as long as those organizations respect property rights and are voluntarily entered.  They're really nothing more than a form of insurance company.

&amp;gt;It is here that a crucial note should be taken: no vision of property is self-evident.

On the contrary.  Homesteading is objectively verifiable and a necessary aspect of any property system.  It is further self-evident that there is no objective way to determine what kind of time frame qualifies "possession and use".  Any system which declares that Person B has a right to what Person A was first to use without A's consent can only be arbitrary.  If I have a house I live in, and I temporarily leave it, at what point can the stuff inside and the house itself by taken by another?  If I leave for a day?  A week?  A month-long trip?  A year touring Europe?  When can you say that I no longer "possess and use" the house?

&amp;gt;If the court favors the standard of possession and use, you, their client, would likely turn away from their service. Additionally, it would help set a cultural precedent of possession and use, wherein future situations similar to yours would not be found to have much in the way of merit.

Only if this court is really a big deal in the culture, as there is no monopoly on this sort of thing.  Also, it is highly unlikely that said court would decide as you hypothesize, given that the entire basis for a court is in self-ownership and individual property rights.

&amp;gt;I am addressing specifically here their penchant for treating those who collect infinitesimally small amounts from the State as if they were necessarily the source of our problems

Most AnCaps I know favor the taking of money from the state, even by those that didn't get directly stolen from in income taxes.

&amp;gt;I am addressing here the treatment of people of color, single parents collecting welfare, and working class.

You are collectivizing people to accuse them of racism, and are apparently unaware that there are some individuals - not all, obviously - that do take actions for the sole purpose of getting or staying on welfare.  More importantly, there are people that agitate for greater payments - and greater theft to pay for it - to help.  One can recognize the economic disincentive to supporting themselves and be against a state policy without disapproving of the person who is hurt by the system, without realizing it.

&amp;gt;I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections.

If AnCaps are "outside the anarchist paradigm", the anarchist paradigm will never work.  Trying to end all hierarchy is to attempt the impossible.  It is a Sisyphean task.  &amp;gt;This is why most anarchists actually propose a hierarchy of the majority over the minority in direct democracy.

Horseshit.

&amp;gt;The market, as defined by anarcho-capitalists, would include mutual aid organizations, as long as those organizations respect property rights and are voluntarily entered.

Yet "anarcho"-capitalists respond to the idea of fascist-wet-dream insurance/court/police corporations running locked-down company towns with sweeping adulation, while treating mutual aid organizations and collectives with "well I guess, if you want".

&amp;gt;When can you say that I no longer "possess and use" the house?

Everyone with at least half a brain understands that if you have credible plans to come back to something then you're still using it, with some caveats.  Of course there's no hard-and-fast rule for determining it.  It's intuitive.  Every fucking human being on the planet is hardwired to understand how it works, even though you can't write it down.  The fact that there are certain social interactions that are extremely functional but can't be codified is WHY we're anarchists!

&amp;gt;Trying to end all hierarchy is to attempt the impossible.

To make a statement like this annihilates any claim of being an Anarchist. I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

For the sake of argument, let's imagine you *legitimately* sit atop a four acre plot of land which you claim ownership over, and immediately adjacent to your east is a four acre wooded lot which you only intermittently use (wood, foraging, small game hunting), but nonetheless believe is your property.

Now let us imagine that squatters end up pitching camp on the land you foraged and hunted from. You, believing that it is your property, do your best to evict them without having to resort to violence (it must be noted here that there can be no strong objection to characterizing evictions as violence; there can be nothing peaceful about physically removing people from their shelter or home, no matter how the property relations are framed), but it seems that nothing can be done to ultimately prevent them from coming back without resorting to violence that cannot be undone or without incurring such a great cost to yourself where you would drive yourself into debt (because as is often pointed out by AnCaps, violence is *expensive*). You, in your frustration, turn to a private court to help solve the matter. It is here that a crucial note should be taken: no vision of property is self-evident. The court, then, has to decide which framework of property it would apply: does it apply the possession and use standard preferred by the squatters? Or does it apply the absentee property theory favored by you?

If the court favors the standard of possession and use, you, their client, would likely turn away from their service. Additionally, it would help set a cultural precedent of possession and use, wherein future situations similar to yours would not be found to have much in the way of merit. At this point, the proposition of defending your claim without sinking yourself into debt makes it virtually impractical to hold any faith in the concept of absentee ownership. But what if the court should decide in your favor? Indeed, it seems more plausible that such an outcome might be found considering the precedent they would set for themselves: by legitimizing the evictions of squatters today, they create the very real possibility that they would use that same legitimizing power to evict more squatters in a cycle of continuing to generate revenue while favoring a vision of property that specifically effects their bottom line. And what of the costs of enforcement of that eviction? You would likely have to pay premiums to the thugs you hired to evict the squatters, which is going to come out of your pocket. And what if squatters keep returning? Either one must accept that their vision of property simply isn't tenable, or that they must constantly turn to an institution to enforce that claim, which is likely to become so astronomically expensive as to drive most subscribers of any such system into debt peonage. We are left, in many ways, with a situation not unlike what exists today excepting several cosmetic differences.

Finally, I suppose my cultural inclinations also had something to do with my resulting disillusion. I often find that AnCaps have not let go of many of their prejudices, particularly as it might relate to those who they consider "leeches"; I am addressing specifically here their penchant for treating those who collect infinitesimally small amounts from the State as if they were necessarily the source of our problems; I am addressing here the treatment of people of color, single parents collecting welfare, and working class. Though it may be frustrating that these people often support the programs which end up hurting them, they don't support it out of "laziness" or whatever characterizations AnCaps want to use, but out of the fact that so many of their options have been *destroyed* by a system that looks at them as inputs to be exploited.

So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections. I self-identified as an Anarcho-Capitalist for about half a decade, and though I strongly identify even today as an anarchist, I have come to the conclusion that capitalism, itself, is wholly incompatible with a genuine theory of liberation.

Pinpointing all of the reasons why this is so would require a post of greater volume and depth than I have time for at the present, but I'll do my best to sum up my primary objections.

I suppose the most basic reason that I reject the concept is that capitalism (defined here simply as "an institutional ideology which emphasizes the role of capital ownership in determining the distribution of goods") offer any positive position for the elimination hierarchy. In fact, it more often than not offers *defenses* of hierarchy, which is difficult to square with the historical anarchist analysis that hierarchy, to put a spin on an old anarchist adage, is the mother of tyranny. This is part and parcel with the AnCap habit of suggesting that if an arrangement is nominally "voluntary", it is by definition *just*-- which I find objectionable for some obvious reasons: if I "voluntarily" entered your house, the mere fact I have done so doesn't imply that I've accepted all of the assumptions that might come with it (do you have a right to kill me? If you acknowledge you don't, then you acknowledge that at the very least there are conceptual limits to "property" as it is often used by AnCaps).

I find that the arguments for market reductionism (i.e. "This problem exists because of State intervention! The market could solve it!") aren't very convincing, and typically regress into a poor defense of existing markets. While it is undeniable a great deal of problems faced by society stem from the State, it cannot be denied that it's counterparts, Organized Religion and Capitalism, have played roles just as great in shaping the existing world we live in. Even if we accept that the market could plausibly offer solutions that might otherwise be difficult to achieve, the AnCap habit of coloring all problems as necessarily being because the market lacks complete elasticity really doesn't help it out, and often times ends up confusing the debate. A good example of this is when people like Brad Spangler unequivocally state "Rothbardian Capitalism is Libertarian Socialism" (this is so fucking flawed from the start) or suggesting that a mutual aid organization is in fact a market organization, which sort of leaves one incredulous-- how can an organization premised in absolute equality for all participants permit profit?

I'm also unconvinced that the typical AnCap vision of property would last in a genuinely liberated society. Even if we take for granted most assumptions AnCaps make -- that DRO's/PDA's/Pigs/Whatever will be prolific, that private courts would assume the roles of existing courts, and that absentee forms of property would be respected -- it does not really leave much of a positive situation to work from.

So I guess to sum it up, I feel like most anarcho-capitalists are essentially "Vulgar Libertarian Lite", and are basically outside of the anarchist paradigm despite their most sincere objections.  I am either a minarchist or an ancap. But I have no way of telling which. There is unfortunately no real evidence a modern ancap community could work well since there basically have been no examples. I would advocate trying an ancap set up somewhere as soon as possible. But I cannot profess that a strategy will work when it basically has not been tested. 

(Somalia, old Ireland are not convincing examples of the sort of systems people here want to set up imo). Principled minarchists are really ancaps in disguise; they just cling to the word, but what they're really advocating for is an accountable gov't -- that's simply what a market in security and law does for them.

So, to me, it's really mostly semantics and I don't bust their chops too much about it, unless they're the weird, unprincipled kind.

&amp;gt;There is unfortunately no real evidence a modern ancap community could work well since there basically have been no examples.

Do you feel the effectiveness and accountability of markets in other industries has been adequately demonstrated? &amp;gt; Principled minarchists are really ancaps in disguise; they just cling to the word, but what they're really advocating for is an accountable gov't -- that's simply what a market in security and law does for them.

I accept that minarchy advocates for an accountable government.

For me, markets offer great solutions to many issues.  But security and law is definitely not one of them.  The reason for minarchy is to manage what cannot be done through markets. &amp;gt; Principled minarchists are really ancaps in disguise; they just cling to the word, but what they're really advocating for is an accountable gov't -- that's simply what a market in security and law does for them.

(Somalia, old Ireland are not convincing examples of the sort of systems people here want to set up imo). See agorism. It's "applied ancap." Abolishing the state is a work in progress, but we've already seen that countereconomics is a winning strategy. There are plenty of an-caps who don't think agorism is a viable strategy to abolish the state. What evidence is there that it's a winning strategy? Has it managed to succeed in abolishing the state anywhere? Any money saved from going to fund the war machine is a good thing.  Strategically perhaps not. There is very good evidence based upon public choice theory that starve the beast leads to more spending because of what is called the debt illusion.

(Somalia, old Ireland are not convincing examples of the sort of systems people here want to set up imo).  Pretty much just emotional reasons in my case. I think we're more likely to see the state slowly fade away due to technology as opposed to some intellectual revolution. In the meantime we'll never be able to convince enough people that we're right. Most of the human beings I meet just don't have a concept of civilization or justice. They absolutely WILL do whatever they can get away with. All that matters to them is whether the risk is worth the reward. Meanwhile, so long as the central authority in place they will behave like submissive dogs because that's their nature.

High IQ people. Cultured, intelligent, they'd do great in a completely free-market world. But I believe it'd be generous to say that even as many as 10% of the human race qualify as those sort of people. The rest crave and absolutely depend on a strong central authority, a god in their lives, and they will EAT the intelligent, self-actualized minority whom they despise, whenever they get the chance to. The mass of human beings don't believe in freedom, they believe in communism. Tribal communism is the environment our species evolved for. The fact that most people aren't high IQ people makes for a strong case against democratic government (and every other kind of government we know from experience to be worse). To operate effectively in a free-market environment, the populace only needs a very basic level of information-- things like, "am I better off buying this apple for $1, or that loaf of bread for $2?" Furthermore, people actually have an incentive to pick the right option when it relates directly to them, as they have total control over the outcome.

Voting on government issues or for government candidates is *not only* something that people have no incentive to learn about-- 1 vote in 300,000,000 is far from "total control"-- it's also *incredibly complicated* for the average person. Everyone can read a price tag, or spend some time shopping around for a car, but when most people have to read a few pages on why corporate subsidies are the product of business pandering to the government- rather than some group of wise, benevolent rulers carefully considering what's in the "general welfare"- they get tired.

Non-high IQ "regular" people get screwed over by government on a regular basis, and unknowingly screw over everyone else on an equally regular basis by supporting various laws and regulations that sound good, but aren't. 

'FDA? Of course! I don't want poisoned meat!' Without realizing that meat providers already have the right incentives to *not* poison their customers- say hello to wasted money on superfluous management, and wasted food that wasn't going to harm anyone. 'Save the automobile industry? Of course! I like cars!' Never mind the fact that whatever's *worth* saving would- for purely rational reasons- be bought up by other, *responsible* entities of the market- hello to backwards incentives, and corporations that are bound to take unreasonable risks because they're "too big to fail."

The very stupidest of people can function near-perfectly in a free market. Will they get stiffed every now and again by some over-zealous advertisement? Sure, but at least that product is sold at a market price- since it has to sell to the more knowledgeable amongst us, and at the very least they aren't hurting others in the process.

Edit: grammar, spelling. I'm no fan of democracy at all. And I don't support the state primarily because I think it's "for the good of the majority" or something pretentious like that, though I do believe that it does tend to be a positive at least by virtue of being an axis society can revolve around. First and foremost I am a cynic who believes we will always have a state until evolution or technology changes us dramatically. We will always have a state because you'll never be able to convince enough people to abandon the state. The state as a meme is alive and well, and at present completely unassailable. 

I would argue that the democratic form of government is the very worst possible. Historically monarchy and even modern dictatorship has behaved more responsibly and with more foresight. Only with the introduction of democracy and the politicization of all life which it entailed, did you start to have total war, full mobilization, cities regularly used as fortresses, etc etc. 

For sheer lack of any other options I advocate single-party rule, chiefly for the benefit of said minority. The dumb masses hate freedom, and they will never allow the minority to be free. But the dumb masses are, in fact, really dumb and easy to manipulate and exploit. Under the circumstances, I see this as the closest humanity can currently come to justice.
 I don't know. You appeal to High IQ people don't sound very convincing. Most people with higher education tend to be more liberal and progressive than anything else and most of the greatest mind in history had more a tendency to the left than to the right when it came to politics. Of course, I am claiming this as an "average IQ" person but I don't think there is a strong connection between intelligence and political affiliation. I'm no fan of democracy at all.

 Your claim that monarchy has behaved "more responsibly" is pretty unfounded. The middle ages weren't exactly the highlight of human society.

And by 'not exactly the highlight' I mean dreadful. 

Only with the introduction of democracy did you have total war? Are we referring to the same history? The Monarchs in Europe, the Czars of Russia, the rulers of various Asian countries including the emperors of China and Japan and dictators throughout all of Africa have waged war unceasingly.

If you grant total power to a king, appointed by bloodline, it's only a matter of time before someone exceptionally unfitting takes the throne and drives the entire country straight downward. Quite irresponsibly. I'm no fan of democracy at all. And I don't support the state primarily because I think it's "for the good of the majority" or something pretentious like that, though I do believe that it does tend to be a positive at least by virtue of being an axis society can revolve around.

 &amp;gt;I think it's "for the good of the majority" or something pretentious like that

So you're against being pretentious but then you say this,

&amp;gt;But the dumb masses are, in fact, really dumb and easy to manipulate and exploit.

Hypocrite much?

Also, I'm no fan of democracy but this,

&amp;gt;Historically monarchy and even modern dictatorship has behaved more responsibly and with more foresight. Only with the introduction of democracy and the politicization of all life which it entailed, did you start to have total war, full mobilization, cities regularly used as fortresses, etc etc.

is just outright nonsense. If you say so. But I'm not a hypocrite. I've been trying to state quite plainly I don't care about the majority of human beings. I would if they showed any signs of wanting to be free, but they don't. It's their fault we're saddled with the state, and always will be. The best we can mange is to enrich and free ourselves at their expense.   Well I was an AnCap up until relatively recently and I frequented this subreddit under a different username.

I moved ideologically from AnCap to a roughly mutualist position. After some time debating/listening to social anarchists when they visited this subreddit, I found myself thinking they had legitimate concerns about authoritarian business practices. I became dissatisfied with the attitude taken by many AnCaps (formerly by myself) that any sort of business arrangement that doesn't violate the NAP is just dandy.

So what I began doing was expanding on my libertarianism. Upon some reflection, I saw that what attracted me to right-libertarianism was my visceral hatred of arbitrary authority. So it made sense for me to oppose all authoritarian relationships, including non-NAP-violating ones. This isn't to say I'd use force to stop these sorts of relationships. Rather, they require some cultural changes to happen. AnCaps, however, tend to be passive on these issues, because they have a singleminded intention of abolishing the state. Abolishing the state is fine, IMO, but it isn't sufficient to reach a just society.

There was also the issue of conflating what happens in the market now with what might happen in a completely stateless free market that I had been advocating. Some left-libertarians took the Misesian argument against centralized authority and applied it to corporations. They argued that large corporations that we see in today's economy couldn't exist without governmental privilege as they face the same economic calculation problems Mises described of socialist states. So if the state is abolished, I'd expect the bureaucratic corporate culture to fall with it.

Moving onto some more central issues, I began to question the validity of permanent ownership of property, or on some level, property itself as AnCaps understand it. After some time, I questioned and rejected Rothbard's view that land can be held indefinitely by the owner once homesteaded. I took the view that if the owner doesn't make use of or occupy the land for a sufficiently long time, then it makes more sense to see it as abandoned. Another issue regarding property is that I see land, posessions, etc. as the physical objects we use to achieve our goals. What matters is that we are able to make use of them for our goals without interference from others, not that we should be able to exclude people from anything we touch. So if I make a tire swing in the woods somewhere, it wouldn't make sense for me to try to prevent others from making use of it when I'm not using it. Rather, it makes more sense to try to prevent others from interfering with my use only. So a kid going for a ride when I'm not around isn't a problem, but some jerk cutting it down is.

Regarding a still more central issue, the NAP. I now see it as a generally good rule of thumb, but not as an absolute mandate on all my actions. So things people do like practical jokes, changing diapers, pushing people out of the way of cars, or whatever are what I'd consider technically violations of the NAP. These are instances where you do in fact interfere with someone's use of their body or property to reach some goal. I wouldn't say that these sorts of things mean that the NAP is worthless. But like any moral principle, it has its limitations and it's worth appreciating that.

**TL;DR I found AnCapism insufficient and moved on to pinko ~~communist~~ libertarian anarchism like a heretic :P** &amp;gt; This isn't to say I'd use force to stop these sorts of relationships. 

This is my problem with most left anarchists. They say they're all for socialism or communism, but wouldn't use force to coerce others into their own system of economics and justice. Well, where does this leave us? 

If you're not willing to use force against others that you disagree with, then you are a voluntaryist. I think it's abominable to try and force people into your own system of coercion when people change their minds on what coercion is justifiable so frequently.  You have to use force against others as well to enforce property rights.  That's only if someone aggresses against your property rights. In reality, force is going to be needed under any system of ethics. Hopefully, that use of force can be contained to self-defense. In terms of property, if someone built a structure, ie a house, under communism; would they not use force to prevent a huge mob of people coming in and occupying it for extended periods of time after the "freeloaders" put no effort into building the house?

I don't think so. Most communists like the idea of exclusivity of their property, as long as it's on a communal scale. Violence doesn't become any more legitimate or illegitimate if you back it with a few more people. &amp;gt;That's only if someone aggresses against your property rights.

Question begging; it smuggles in normative assumptions about the nature of property that are not self-evident or held true across all circumstances. You can't appeal to your vision of property rights to prove your vision of property rights.

And your question about how communists would deal with the "freeloaders" is as ridiculous as when people ask "but who will build the roads"? It belies a complete disinterest in actually understanding what the analysis is and the recommendations are. That's only if someone aggresses against your property rights. In reality, force is going to be needed under any system of ethics. Hopefully, that use of force can be contained to self-defense. In terms of property, if someone built a structure, ie a house, under communism; would they not use force to prevent a huge mob of people coming in and occupying it for extended periods of time after the "freeloaders" put no effort into building the house?

I don't think so. Most communists like the idea of exclusivity of their property, as long as it's on a communal scale. Violence doesn't become any more legitimate or illegitimate if you back it with a few more people. Your property rights are not self-evident or universally accepted and to uphold them you would require force going beyond the the frame of "self-defense". &amp;gt; This isn't to say I'd use force to stop these sorts of relationships.

If you're not willing to use force against others that you disagree with, then you are a voluntaryist. I think it's abominable to try and force people into your own system of coercion when people change their minds on what coercion is justifiable so frequently.  Culture has an enormous impact on the sorts of arrangements people make. I advocate an anti-authoritarian culture that encourages horizontal business arrangements rather than hierarchical ones. That's really all there is to it.

I'll put this another way, Stefan Molyneux (despite being obnoxiously egocentric) does makes some good points about his idea of "peaceful parenting." He's proposing a complete reevaluation of the parenting paradigms in our society. Fun fact, he doesn't want to force parents to act the way he wants them to. Does this mean he's making a moot point about the sorts of parent-child relationships we should have? I don't think so.

You are probably the first person that I believe that was previously an ancap and left. I see too many that make the claim, but don't really grasp the ideas fully. I actually feel exactly like you do on this topics, but I still consider myself an ancap.

&amp;gt; I began to question the validity of permanent ownership of property

I completely agree. IMO ownership rights "spoil" as per Lockes proviso. Labor must continuously be input into the land to maintain any claim of ownership.

So if someone builds a fence, they own that until time and weather turn it to dust. I find it silly when someone claims that the land surrounding that fence, even though it's now dust, is still owned. there is no labor basis for ownership at that point and the whole idea of homesteading is out the window without labor.

&amp;gt; What matters is that we are able to make use of them for our goals without interference from others, not that we should be able to exclude people from anything we touch.

One in the same. the problem here is who determines whether touching is OK or not? The owner does. 

However I agree with where your thinking is at here. You're imagining a large area that several people might share and it's not fair for one person to exclude others for stuff he'll never use. This is why again I think that it's the responsibility of the owner to exclude people and not the responsibly to respect anyone elses property that might be abandoned. Thats the real discussion, what constitutes abandonment.

So if someone wants to spend the money guarding their property 24/7 to keep people off of it, then they should be allowed to. What shouldn't be happening is that they claim property and then don't do anything to protect it, expecting it to be just as they left it 50 years prior. Thats absurd.

&amp;gt; So things people do like practical jokes, changing diapers, pushing people out of the way of cars, or whatever are what I'd consider technically violations of the NAP. These are instances where you do in fact interfere with someone's use of their body or property to reach some goal.

But there is still a cost to these. it might be your goal to push someone out of the way of a car, but what if they were filming a movie and actually wanted to be hit by that car? Would you simply walk away saying "hey i saved you"? No, you damaged them through your aggression and would therefore be responsible. 

I agree that many times the damage would be waved by the person you saved, but thats for them to decide, not you.

In regards to mutualism, I think they are too reluctant to let go of the idea of charity. if they didn't believe that everyone owes everyone else charity, then I could accept them more. After all, if I want to use the market, but don't want to give charity, then why should I be forced to? &amp;gt;But there is still a cost to these. it might be your goal to push someone out of the way of a car, but what if they were filming a movie and actually wanted to be hit by that car? Would you simply walk away saying "hey i saved you"? No, you damaged them through your aggression and would therefore me responsible. 

Well, okay. But really, how likely is that? I have my doubts over the prospects of a polycentric legal system being that...legalistic about it. Granted, if this happened to me, I'd probably say "well okay. Sorry. I won't interfere next time you get in front of a car." Well I was an AnCap up until relatively recently and I frequented this subreddit under a different username.

I moved ideologically from AnCap to a roughly mutualist position. After some time debating/listening to social anarchists when they visited this subreddit, I found myself thinking they had legitimate concerns about authoritarian business practices. I became dissatisfied with the attitude taken by many AnCaps (formerly by myself) that any sort of business arrangement that doesn't violate the NAP is just dandy.

So what I began doing was expanding on my libertarianism. Upon some reflection, I saw that what attracted me to right-libertarianism was my visceral hatred of arbitrary authority. So it made sense for me to oppose all authoritarian relationships, including non-NAP-violating ones. This isn't to say I'd use force to stop these sorts of relationships. Rather, they require some cultural changes to happen. AnCaps, however, tend to be passive on these issues, because they have a singleminded intention of abolishing the state. Abolishing the state is fine, IMO, but it isn't sufficient to reach a just society.

There was also the issue of conflating what happens in the market now with what might happen in a completely stateless free market that I had been advocating. Some left-libertarians took the Misesian argument against centralized authority and applied it to corporations. They argued that large corporations that we see in today's economy couldn't exist without governmental privilege as they face the same economic calculation problems Mises described of socialist states. So if the state is abolished, I'd expect the bureaucratic corporate culture to fall with it.

Moving onto some more central issues, I began to question the validity of permanent ownership of property, or on some level, property itself as AnCaps understand it. After some time, I questioned and rejected Rothbard's view that land can be held indefinitely by the owner once homesteaded. I took the view that if the owner doesn't make use of or occupy the land for a sufficiently long time, then it makes more sense to see it as abandoned. Another issue regarding property is that I see land, posessions, etc. as the physical objects we use to achieve our goals. What matters is that we are able to make use of them for our goals without interference from others, not that we should be able to exclude people from anything we touch. So if I make a tire swing in the woods somewhere, it wouldn't make sense for me to try to prevent others from making use of it when I'm not using it. Rather, it makes more sense to try to prevent others from interfering with my use only. So a kid going for a ride when I'm not around isn't a problem, but some jerk cutting it down is.

Regarding a still more central issue, the NAP. I now see it as a generally good rule of thumb, but not as an absolute mandate on all my actions. So things people do like practical jokes, changing diapers, pushing people out of the way of cars, or whatever are what I'd consider technically violations of the NAP. These are instances where you do in fact interfere with someone's use of their body or property to reach some goal. I wouldn't say that these sorts of things mean that the NAP is worthless. But like any moral principle, it has its limitations and it's worth appreciating that.

This is interesting, but what do you think about ownership of larger objects like houses? This would allow people to walk inside them and enjoy them as long as they don't "get in the owner's way" as it were. E.g. you can't disallow someone from being in your house while you're at work. And what do you think about physical exclusionary mechanisms like doors and locks? Would a person be "allowed" to lock up his or her house?

Btw I don't think this is a mutualist position per se since "use" in their terminology would be "continual possession" i.e. you technically own your house regular style while you live in it. Correct? This argument *again*?

I know this has been answered for you (you, /u/MyGogglesDoNothing specifically) multiple times. A little common sense is all that is needed to understand whether someone is using a house or not. 

Do you have no neighbors that have ever seen your face? Do you never clean your house? Is there a layer of dust built up for months? Do you have no pictures of yourself or your family? Do you not have a dog or a cat? A bird? Do you *never* maintain your lawn? Is there spider-webs on your fence gate? 

Is it *really* that hard for you to tell whether someone lives in a house or not?

Or do you just need a state-like force of law to dictate that for you? &amp;gt; So if I make a tire swing in the woods somewhere, it wouldn't make sense for me to try to prevent others from making use of it when I'm not using it.

I don't see why not. Like most people, I don't particularly want strangers walking through my ~~house~~ apartment. That said. Even if we take residences as an example, it's a fairly common practice for people in neighborhoods to turn around their cars in the driveways of strangers and it seems like an accepted practice. However, does this not technically count as trespass?

Edit: Or to take another example, in most neighborhoods, people let their dogs urinate or defecate on others' lawns. Both may be considered trespass by AnCaps. However, most people have accepted both, (so long as the dog owner picks up poop afterwards).

I will admit that there is a certain fuzziness to this issue and different communities or societies may come up with different conventions to deal with these sorts of disputes through their legal systems. But if you're worried, no, I won't [take over hour house while you're out grocery shopping](http://imgur.com/DyBWC).

**TL;DR I found AnCapism insufficient and moved on to pinko ~~communist~~ libertarian anarchism like a heretic :P**  I think one of the questions is whether or not opposition to the state, which is something I'm not likely to change my mind on, implies some sort of anarchy.

Likewise I certainly object to the excesses of property, but I don't think those situations rise to an advocacy for the abolition of property -- I cannot conceive of any livable society without property.  In order for me, personally, to be happy, I require property and solitude, and a fair amount of it.  I like property itself, by which I mean not so much the means of production, but land.  I like property itself more than the "idea" of property as a philosophical principle, though I understand that the two are inextricably linked.

The question as to anarchy is whether or not we'd rather deal with the problems of it (and there are many, no matter which variant of it you're talking about), or those of the state.  And likewise property.

Given the choice, I choose to deal with the problems of statelessness rather than statism, and I would rather choose to deal with the problems of property rather than propertylessness.

Lastly there is this: Are the current paradigms escapable?  In point of fact, the vast majority of people, however they feel theoretically about property, would object violently to having it taken away from them (this only builds as people age and acquire it -- it's one thing to be anti-property when you're 22 and don't have any, and another to be anti-property when you finally score your rural getaway at 50).  This is one reason why anarchism is so popular among the young, but you find less and less anarchists as people age.  

I am finished with picking a label for myself because every single political position has flaws and considerable problems.  Generally speaking I care to describe myself as on the far left of propertarian anti-statelessness.  I avoid using the term capitalist for myself because while I can't conceive in a free or just society in which capitalism is impossible (by which I mean: employer-employee hierarchies and so on), these are not the arrangements I'd personally choose in a system of competing organizational schemes (I like worker-run enterprises...until and unless they're wrecks and disasters.)  I am not very interested in accumulating wealth, possessions, or gold, but I simply cannot see the injustice in this that critics on the Left do -- sometimes, obviously, but not always.  I have my needs and dreams and wants, and I acknowledge that capitalists do, too.

There is absolutely nothing about the Left's position against property which makes me even want to sympathize with them on this: societies in which property has been abolished in part or in whole are not places I'd want to live in, and I do not want strangers squatting fifty feet (or whatever the limits of possession are) from my house.  I do not want some council or vote or something determining my "needs," which seems implicit in any society that abolishes property but recognizes possessions.

I have little love nor pity for the majority.  I do not want what they want, and I do not tend to see things the way they do -- I have no class consciousness, even in terms of my own class.  A thing does not automatically become a moral imperative simply because lots of people want it or demand it.  A thing does not become automatically evil because only a minority wants it.  Sometimes things line up that way, but often they don't.  That the majority of people apparently want endless war, for example, and keep electing people to wage it, doesn't really make any kind of convincing moral case for it. 

I don't think of myself as alike or different from others as a consequence of my social class and don't really understand those who do (I am middle-middle class).  Class to me is like differentiating people along the lines of hair color.  Filthy rich or dirt poor, white or black, gay or straight, if you like standing on desert plains watching dust devils rip into the guts of the earth, you're my kind of people.

I walk in any city in this country and feel alienated and alone, like I'm from somewhere else.  The world as it has been made, is not how I would have made it.   The kinds of things traditional anarchists want and envision for a better society, I'm about 50/50 on.  Certainly I will need a vacation from them as I tend to need a vacation from anything.

I will insist on property, and my right to create my own little world on it, and this goes beyond mathematical philosophical arguments -- I need it to live, and am more than happy to share my things with those who ask.    I do not feel, think, or feel particularly bad about my insistence on property, nor my willingness to defend it with force if necessary.

Asking to share, or asking for easement rights, or asking to cross my field, is likely to be granted with a dismissive "of course, no problem."

It's the demanding that's a problem.

And all of this is why I don't like the term AnCap, for me.  If anything, I am a Walden Pond type.  I despise fences, no trespassing signs, and so on, but will insist on them -- the right to put them up -- should circumstances warrant.  Undoubtedly anti-property types will doubt my assertion here, but I really do hate signs and fences -- a lot.  I just sometimes think they become necessary because people can be total douchebags.

And I understand why someone would want to get rich and buy a Lamborghini, and that's their right, even if it isn't for me...and it just isn't for me.  But if I expect them to stand up for my lifestyle, well, it seems important than I stand up for theirs.  

I do believe wealth can be honestly accumulated, and I do not believe, having been an employee all of my life, that every employee-employer relationship is necessarily exploitative or that the hierarchy that results is necessarily unjust.  Often it is -- often it isn't.  My real-life experience just doesn't reflect anarchist claims regarding this scenario.

Anarcho-capitalism implies something about one's values, and I just don't think of mine as falling within that category, but in recognizing we all want different things, I have to respect the entrepreneurial spirit and all of the things the capitalism part of anarcho-capitalism implies.

I find it funny the degree to which, especially online, people will be judged by how they say they think.  A fellow could own his own business and put $15K a year into the food bank in his community and he'll say, "I am a capitalist," and he'll be sneered at and (virtually) spat upon, while some anarchist vagrant who can't even keep his own nose wiped will insist on his moral superiority on account of his ideology.

I judge people on what they do, not what they insist they believe.  As a result, I have friends all over the political spectrum.  In a situation in which the state withers and recedes, I will likely continue to live my values in the same way. I think one of the questions is whether or not opposition to the state, which is something I'm not likely to change my mind on, implies some sort of anarchy.

Likewise I certainly object to the excesses of property, but I don't think those situations rise to an advocacy for the abolition of property -- I cannot conceive of any livable society without property.  In order for me, personally, to be happy, I require property and solitude, and a fair amount of it.  I like property itself, by which I mean not so much the means of production, but land.  I like property itself more than the "idea" of property as a philosophical principle, though I understand that the two are inextricably linked.

The question as to anarchy is whether or not we'd rather deal with the problems of it (and there are many, no matter which variant of it you're talking about), or those of the state.  And likewise property.

Given the choice, I choose to deal with the problems of statelessness rather than statism, and I would rather choose to deal with the problems of property rather than propertylessness.

Lastly there is this: Are the current paradigms escapable?  In point of fact, the vast majority of people, however they feel theoretically about property, would object violently to having it taken away from them (this only builds as people age and acquire it -- it's one thing to be anti-property when you're 22 and don't have any, and another to be anti-property when you finally score your rural getaway at 50).  This is one reason why anarchism is so popular among the young, but you find less and less anarchists as people age.  

I am finished with picking a label for myself because every single political position has flaws and considerable problems.  Generally speaking I care to describe myself as on the far left of propertarian anti-statelessness.  I avoid using the term capitalist for myself because while I can't conceive in a free or just society in which capitalism is impossible (by which I mean: employer-employee hierarchies and so on), these are not the arrangements I'd personally choose in a system of competing organizational schemes (I like worker-run enterprises...until and unless they're wrecks and disasters.)  I am not very interested in accumulating wealth, possessions, or gold, but I simply cannot see the injustice in this that critics on the Left do -- sometimes, obviously, but not always.  I have my needs and dreams and wants, and I acknowledge that capitalists do, too.

There is absolutely nothing about the Left's position against property which makes me even want to sympathize with them on this: societies in which property has been abolished in part or in whole are not places I'd want to live in, and I do not want strangers squatting fifty feet (or whatever the limits of possession are) from my house.  I do not want some council or vote or something determining my "needs," which seems implicit in any society that abolishes property but recognizes possessions.

I have little love nor pity for the majority.  I do not want what they want, and I do not tend to see things the way they do -- I have no class consciousness, even in terms of my own class.  A thing does not automatically become a moral imperative simply because lots of people want it or demand it.  A thing does not become automatically evil because only a minority wants it.  Sometimes things line up that way, but often they don't.  That the majority of people apparently want endless war, for example, and keep electing people to wage it, doesn't really make any kind of convincing moral case for it. 

I don't think of myself as alike or different from others as a consequence of my social class and don't really understand those who do (I am middle-middle class).  Class to me is like differentiating people along the lines of hair color.  Filthy rich or dirt poor, white or black, gay or straight, if you like standing on desert plains watching dust devils rip into the guts of the earth, you're my kind of people.

I walk in any city in this country and feel alienated and alone, like I'm from somewhere else.  The world as it has been made, is not how I would have made it.   The kinds of things traditional anarchists want and envision for a better society, I'm about 50/50 on.  Certainly I will need a vacation from them as I tend to need a vacation from anything.

I will insist on property, and my right to create my own little world on it, and this goes beyond mathematical philosophical arguments -- I need it to live, and am more than happy to share my things with those who ask.    I do not feel, think, or feel particularly bad about my insistence on property, nor my willingness to defend it with force if necessary.

Asking to share, or asking for easement rights, or asking to cross my field, is likely to be granted with a dismissive "of course, no problem."

It's the demanding that's a problem.

And all of this is why I don't like the term AnCap, for me.  If anything, I am a Walden Pond type.  I despise fences, no trespassing signs, and so on, but will insist on them -- the right to put them up -- should circumstances warrant.  Undoubtedly anti-property types will doubt my assertion here, but I really do hate signs and fences -- a lot.  I just sometimes think they become necessary because people can be total douchebags.

And I understand why someone would want to get rich and buy a Lamborghini, and that's their right, even if it isn't for me...and it just isn't for me.  But if I expect them to stand up for my lifestyle, well, it seems important than I stand up for theirs.  

I do believe wealth can be honestly accumulated, and I do not believe, having been an employee all of my life, that every employee-employer relationship is necessarily exploitative or that the hierarchy that results is necessarily unjust.  Often it is -- often it isn't.  My real-life experience just doesn't reflect anarchist claims regarding this scenario.

The only ancaps I've seen change were the deontological ones and they do it simply because their ethics shift into libertarian socialism / left-libertarianism; I've never seen an Austrian, consequentialist ancap change their mind about it.

There are *many* nuances you can develop, though, like how you talk about anarcho-capitalism or whether you even choose to.

Since becoming an ancap about two years ago, what I've done since is kind of calm down about many things.  I've also gotten really good at irl discussion of the issue. It's the economics baby. Nothing in our DNA needs to change, we just need to reason our way out of our fear of society and *stop the goddamn stealing*. &amp;gt;It's the economics baby.

then you say,

&amp;gt;we just need to reason our way out

As I understand economics, it has absolutely no connection to democracy.  People needing to "reason things out" implies the democratic theory of social change.  But, as you know, economies don't function like that and I don't think I've ever seen a society liberalize its political economic policies except in those instances where reality created incredibly uncomfortable, distressing crises.

When I look at the global economy and the history of its development, I see spontaneous order.  It's my belief that if Man had to tribally plan his way through progress, we never would've left the caves and trees.

Taking this into consideration, I don't believe such conscious "reasoning out" amounts to anything on the global societal scale of order.  To me, being an ancap is mostly about being a critical thinker, one who was probably a political junkie and avid debater who enjoyed the joust before they arrived at the position, than it is about any sort of conscious activism.

I know this sounds distressing to some people, that one can't do anything to influence the system positively toward their ends, but there's a silver lining to the view in that the system spontaneously progresses regardless of the political predation and capital disruption. The only ancaps I've seen change were the deontological ones and they do it simply because their ethics shift into libertarian socialism / left-libertarianism; I've never seen an Austrian, consequentialist ancap change their mind about it.

I'm a philosophy novice, explain the difference in deontological versus consequential philosophies, please? (An example included would help me understand easier. Also, if you know a good video.)  The inability of anarchic systems to confront the reality of warfare. This does not really seem to be an issue these days. Very little warfare is boots on the ground. If an ancap society is as rich as this subreddit predicts they should be able to produce the weapons of modern warfare easily (fighter planes, etc). &amp;gt; these days

Shouldn't the ancap principles be timeless and technology-independent? 

I wouldn't want to be caught arguing that private roads can work because we can RFID cars and detect them as they drive past an overpass...

EDIT: spelling This does not really seem to be an issue these days. Very little warfare is boots on the ground. If an ancap society is as rich as this subreddit predicts they should be able to produce the weapons of modern warfare easily (fighter planes, etc). + as much as we hate them for offensive purposes, drones for defense may be a needed levelling factor in defending smaller countries. Also, think of the Swiss Guard in the middle of the last millennium. A hired force that readily protected huge swaths of land against other countries.  I'm not an expert on Swiss or European history, but I always thought that they tended to got get invaded in large part because they made a credible commitment to staying neutral. Attempts at European domination skipped them over because potential conquerors knew they wouldn't have to worry about being attacked by the Swiss. They could be safely ignored until the real enemies were taken out. They made invading a bad idea not by making the costs so great, but rather by making the benefits so meager. This does not really seem to be an issue these days. Very little warfare is boots on the ground. If an ancap society is as rich as this subreddit predicts they should be able to produce the weapons of modern warfare easily (fighter planes, etc). The inability of anarchic systems to confront the reality of warfare. The inability of anarchic systems to confront the reality of warfare. Pah, the militias of the CNT crushed the coup, and they could have united Catalonia to Asturica, used the "People's War" large-scale guerrilla strategy that had flummoxed Napoleon, and promised liberty to Morocco, if they hadn't been organized for expediency in recruiting rather than on principle to prefigure the post-capitalist society.  The madness of joining the capitalist Republican government, rather than wiping it away entirely and proclaiming the social revolution, should have been the only sign that was needed that the CNT was the walking dead; joining the government turned a class war into just another war of two sections of the bourgeoisie, using the proletariat as pawns.  Even in May 1937, as the Stalinist boot descended on the people's throat, there was one last opportunity to reject regularization of the militias, overthrow the government, and "restructure" the CNT (at one point, an anarchist artillery crew had their guns trained on the Barcelona headquarters)- yet because the organization and preparations did not exist, the people were paralyzed and defeated.

An Anarchist society can certainly carry out a war, if we're ready- but then that's what separates an Anarchist society from one which merely does not have a State.  I'm an ex-an-cap, you'll see me around... Is that a threat or a promise?  When I was a teenager I was a default Anarcho-Capitalist without ever knowing that such a movement existed. I was firmly anti-authoritarian (anti-state, anti-ruler, anti-boss, anti-church-elder) because I believed respect had to be earned through action; it should never be granted through authority.

I also had a teacher that explained in very simple terms why communism fails; despite my furthered research into communism I still found that major flaw of lack of motivation to be present. So, I figured I was pro-capitalist on this virtue alone.

Then as I grew up, I became more involved in various anarchist movements and struggles, I saw the danger of capitalism, I saw the vast inequality that having an ownership class and a worker class creates. 

It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I finally understood the distinct difference(s) between *Capitalism* and *Free Markets*. For all my life I, like most everyone in America, directly linked the two as one complete thought. Once I realized that you can maintain free market ideals without an inevitable unequal and oppressive Owner&amp;gt;Manager&amp;gt;Supervisor&amp;gt;Worker system, I began "creating" my own solutions. 

**"He that does not work, neither let him eat."** - Most pro-capitalists love to support the idea of being rewarded for their labor without realizing that capitalism specifically supports the opposite: Reward for someone else's labor. They denounce and decry the "lazy" lower class for not wanting to work but still receiving the fruits of someone else's hard work, while at the same time supporting and defending owners and the upper class for doing *the same fucking thing*. 

First, despite my former adherence to property rights, I realized that we cannot weave the two concepts of "Worker Ownership" and "Private Property Rights." It just doesn't work. As I fooled around with various ideas, bouncing them off of other people, having a variety of individuals from many aspects of life bring up very valid counter-arguments to my ideas... 

I eventually worked out what I felt was a workable system that perfectly straddles free market ideals, worker ownership, absence of oppressive worker/owner systems, a state-less society, voluntary relationships, while standing up for the oppressed.

Turns out it was pretty damn close to *Mutualism*. I am not a true "mutualist" (no mutualist is), but I found out about a year ago that all my ideals, my self-proposed systems and philosophies, were already laid out in a system.

------

For all the "benefits" of capitalism (which I admit most certainly do exist), I cannot ignore all the dangers it creates. I feel it is a fantasy to believe that there is not widespread inequality, danger to health and safety, massively oppressive hierarchal structures, damaging the Earth, global warming, information suppression, all largely *due to capitalism* (not the state). The idea that without the state that the "free market" will fix capitalism is no less idealistic and fake than communists utopian bullshit. 

The rationale behind the "free market regulates itself" makes sense when you're 16 and just learning economics. How any adult can fully believe that, is beyond me.

(Although, at least with communists, their utopia *would* be pretty fucking awesome: no money, everyone has fulfilling work, no bosses, no state, no leaders, everyone working together... I just don't think it's realistic)

There has to be a better way. Ignoring your own system's faults makes you no better than the statists or communists. It's that "better way" that I constantly seek to find. "What's wrong with that?" or "Does it violate NAP?" is only a starting point. 

You should be asking "How can we do it better?" - Yet no AnCap ever does. &amp;gt; First, despite my former adherence to property rights, I realized that we cannot weave the two concepts of "Worker Ownership" and "Private Property Rights." It just doesn't work.

Why won't "Worker Ownership" and "Private Property Rights" both exist? I am going to push back on this idea and I assure you I am genuinely curious; I am not just being an ass.

Many socialists/black-star-anarchists/communists echo your sentiment. In contrast, I believe the systems can coexist. These folks merely tells me that capitalism is aggressive and will violently expand, crushing worker-owned systems.

First, I'd like to point out that capitalism and worker owned cooperatives already exist. Now I will delve into a longer argument.

Once ownership of undeveloped land is eliminated, then any group of people should be able to find land that can sustain their needs of food, water, and shelter (this will remain true for quite some time, so let's take this as an assumption for now). This frees them from non-violent outside forces and gives them the same type of lifestyle that almost all humans had until the year 1900 and that many humans have today. Even the young, disabled, and elderly are cared for in these societies. I view anything beyond this level of existence as a blessing, not a "right" (I know "right" is a loaded term, but you get the gist).

After this level of existence, those who want to engage in trade with big players, such as Foxconn can do so. People flock from rural China into factories like Foxconn to be able to live in a city and have a better life than they had before. Capitalists did not put them into their village lifestyle; capitalists made their lives better.

Alternatively, if workers felt they did *not* want Foxconn's wages, workers could (1) go back to their village, (2) strike and negotiate for better wages, or (3) create their own jobs. Workers do all three of these things.

In short, what do you have against the system as described above?

&amp;gt; damaging the Earth, global warming, information suppression, all largely due to capitalism (not the state)

What is the mutualist solution to these problems? &amp;gt;Why won't "Worker Ownership" and "Private Property Rights" both exist?

What happens when the worker leaves? Does he take a portion of it with him? Does he have to sell his share? Does he even have a share? If he's not working there, he can't be an owner; the two concepts just don't work. Ownership remains with the non-existent "company", not to any individuals. 

The only way it really works (consistently) without allowing an avenue for constant bickering is to absolve the idea of property rights. You get a portion of the profits so long as you're working there, but when you quit that's it. 

&amp;gt;I'd like to point out that capitalism and worker owned cooperatives already exist.

Coops do exist within a larger capitalist system. But on a world wide, country wide, nation wide, or city wide scale, it just can't keep going.

&amp;gt;Once ownership of undeveloped land is eliminated, then any group of people should be able to find land that can sustain their needs of food, water, and shelter (this will remain true for quite some time, so let's take this as an assumption for now).

Correct. But what happens when there's no more viable land? You're left with "owners" and "workers" as separate classes where the workers have no choice but to submit to the owners or else starve to death.

Property rights (in the capitalist sense) only works in the short term or in areas where there is unlimited new land. Perhaps when we start colonizing other planets we can try an AnCap system, but until then it can't work.

&amp;gt;After this level of existence, those who want to engage in trade with big players, such as Foxconn can do so. People flock from rural China into factories like Foxconn to be able to live in a city and have a better life than they had before. Capitalists did not put them into their village lifestyle; capitalists made their lives better.

You are literally trying to defend the practice of sweatshops. Just stop. Fucking stop right there. Let it sink in that you are supporting the practice of sweatshops.

No further discussion need be had. I'm serious.

&amp;gt;In short, what do you have against the system as described above?

Owners take what the workers made. That's why I highlighted the "He who does not work, neither let him eat." All wages are theft; tricking people or exploiting their need to survive does not change the fact that it is still theft even if they "agree" to it out of desperation.

&amp;gt;What is the mutualist solution to these problems?

Worker ownership 

It makes it much more difficult (not impossible, but far less plausible) to perform dangerous actions while getting the entire workforce to agree to the dangerous action. 

If every JPMorgan Chase employee had a right to vote on whether the company should be accepting sub-prime loans with the intention of selling them under false pretenses to unknowing investors at a personal profit, it is highly unlikely that the motion would have passed. But when just a dozen (or less) "owners" are the ones performing the action, it's easy to justify in the name of profit.

----

If you see no moral apprehension against any of those negative side-effects (sweatshops, evil behavior for profit), then there's nothing to be discussed. You're only highlighting why I am appalled and disgusted by the general American-Libertarian, Minarchist, Anarcho-Capitalist, Right-Libertarian movement(s). What's even worse is when you people claim to hold the moral high ground "because... because the NAP!" 

Hypocrites. When I was a teenager I was a default Anarcho-Capitalist without ever knowing that such a movement existed. I was firmly anti-authoritarian (anti-state, anti-ruler, anti-boss, anti-church-elder) because I believed respect had to be earned through action; it should never be granted through authority.

You should be asking "How can we do it better?" - Yet no AnCap ever does.  I'm a minarchist in the sense that it is a more realistic next step from where we are now here in America than absolutely no government at all. 

It could also be that I don't get too deep philosophically because at a certain point I feel like you're arguing one or two little things. The monopoly on law is not one little thing. It is everything. If people can't choose, then there is no check on the growth of government.

I think a minarchy would be fine to live in. I also think it's absolutely ridiculous to think that one could exist for very long without growing outside its bounds. Unlike ancap, which has not been tried, we have some good evidence from the early days of the US that small governments always overstep their bounds, with little other than political whim to stop it. I'm a minarchist in the sense that it is a more realistic next step from where we are now here in America than absolutely no government at all. 

It could also be that I don't get too deep philosophically because at a certain point I feel like you're arguing one or two little things.   I pretty much realized that I did not like any of the philosophies backing up the major forms of anarchocapitalism, mainly empiricism and reason as exclusive mediums for knowledge. (I realize that this is not all ancaps, but it seems to be prevalent.)
I have also come to realize that I like other types of stateless societies proposed as well as, and sometimes more than, those proposed by ancaps. 

So it is not that I think anarchocapitalism is wrong, I just feel it is too exclusive to describe my beliefs and thoughts. :) The austrian school is based on rationalism though. If not by reason how else would we gain knowledge? I am not saying that I am against reason, I am simply saying that I do not see it as a supreme or exclusive means to knowledge.
 You also said that you didn't believe in empiricism, so how can we gain knowledge? The austrian school is based on rationalism though. If not by reason how else would we gain knowledge?  I had posed a similar question a few months back.  I was reading thru Bastiat's Harmonies the other day and came across the following (below) that helps me somewhat.  I believe if you're going to be a 'former' ancap, you're going to cut the tree from the root, not just trim a few branches.  as such, I wouldn't expect many 'former' ancaps to chime in - they've long abandoned this line of thinkings.

"What makes the various socialist schools (I mean here those schools that look to an artificial social order for the solution of the social problem) radically different from the economist school is not some minor detail in viewpoint or in preferred form of government; it is to be found in their respective points of departure, in their answers to this primary and central question: Are men's interests, when left to themselves, harmonious or antagonistic? 

It is evident that the socialists set out in quest of an artificial social order only because they deemed the natural order to be either bad or inadequate; and they deemed it bad or inadequate only because they felt that men's interests are fundamentally antagonistic, for otherwise they would not have had recourse to coercion. It is not necesary to force into harmony things that are inherently harmonious. "

 This is also part of my problem with AnCaps: 1.) you've turned men who wrote words on paper into near-deities and 2.) it doesn't take very long for AnCaps to just start screaming about how you "didn't understand, never understood" just what they believed. It should be obvious why the first problem is a problem. In the case of the second, it is incredibly arrogant to suggest that we simply "do not know" enough, especially considering that you really have no idea who we are in the first place. What if I told you I was once a prolific and popular AnCap blogger, who was often cited and sourced by other AnCaps? I'm telling you this because it is true; suggesting that we can't possibly have figured out a reasonable objection without being characterized as ignorant of the ideology only suggests that you'd go to great lengths to protect your most cherished beliefs. 

I'd also suggest you learn to contextualize translated documents from well over 150 years ago, because Bastiat was specifically talking about the State socialists ("(I mean here those schools that look to an artificial social order for the solution of the social problem)", not Proudhon and the various anarchists socialists. &amp;gt;1.) you've turned men who wrote words on paper into near-deities&amp;gt;...not Proudhon and the various anarchists socialists.

I used to consider myself an an-cap until I read Anarchy, State and Utopia by Robert Nozick.

Now I would say that I don't necessarily endorse a minimal state as a good idea, but I'm open to the possibility of a system with a minimal state being the best or at least philosophically acceptable.

In addition to the actually philosophy, reading Nozick very much sold me on an approach that treats philosophy as a journey rather than a destination. I don't think that anyone has all the answers and I don't like a Rothbardian or Randian approach that asserts that you do. Every philosophical argument has weaknesses and if you can't acknowledge yours then I don't think you have really challenged your beliefs.

Nozick's argument is too long for me to effectively summarize, but I'd be happy to discuss it in detail if anyone wants to. There are enough good summaries and explanations of his argument that I won't bother with my own. I haven't read *Anarchy, State and Utopia*, but it's on my to-read list. Nozick essentially argues for many mini-states that allow free travel between them, right? If so, that is my core belief (check out my flair).

I do not want to force anarcho-capitalism on anyone else. I just want to be able to either live in anarcho-capitalist society or enter into an actual social contract with a state. I wouldn't mind living in a Sweden-like state if I had a great opportunity there, and my rights would not be violated because I freely chose to give up my rights to be able to live there.

The only anarcho-capitalist critique of Nozick that I am aware of is Rothbard's critique that Nozick believes in the "immaculate conception of the state," i.e. states will *always* form. I think that under Nozick's scenario, most societies will have a state, but societies with various flavors of anarchy will emerge, too.  I stopped believing in AnCap when I began to debate mutualists. The knowledge I learned about the Right of Increase (with Proudhon's 3 aubaines, or increases; profit, rent, interest) and the origins of profit were key to my abandonment of AnCap. Also key to this was my desire for an anarchic form of property, which I still currently believe in and see as a form of possession based on use-cycles and occupancy-cycles.

I also learned that it's somewhat fallacious to reduce all of society's problems to "the State" because the State, while undesirable by all of my standards, has *some* benevolent tendencies, which I find that the economic counterpart (capitalists) does not have. 

I'm currently (past few days, to be specific) having an internal debate in my mind on the "economy(ies?) of a mutualistic society, and how they might function. I'm really trying to understand the neo-Proudhonian strain of Mutualism more (I started off on a more Tuckerite side with Carsonite tendencies), which I'll probably be able to form an opinion on, in the very least, over the next few weeks. A few days ago, however, I would have said that I think the best route for society is an anti-capitalistic free market that results in gift economy after having reached post-scarcity, or a service-based economy. Look into Syndicalism.  Not because it's correct, but because it has some mechanisms that can be highly profitable to steal.  The idea of federation is powerful, and a gift economy based on decentralized and ad-hoc federations of autonomous collectives is actually a free market.  The main issue with any type of anti-state ideology for me is one of feasibility, there just is no way for it to actually come about. For such a radical change to come about, the existing state would have (a) willingly give up power, land, resources(...), or (b) suffer some sort of collapse to wrest away existing state power. However, after collapses (economic, political...) the result is almost never a LESS powerful state, and almost always a far more powerful one. As far as a state relinquishing power, that seems equally impossible; state power (especially in the west) has been on a constant increase and shows no sign of any slowing. The main problem here is that 99% of the population either cares nothing for any form debate on the legitimacy of state power or is consciously in favor of state power, and they all take handouts from the state when it is offered and most demand more in the future, while effectively no one advocates for less (all political dialogue ends up boiling down to arguing over WHERE the handouts should be focused). &amp;gt;all political dialogue ends up boiling down to arguing over WHERE the handouts should be focused

Except Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, they're the only 2 who ever really advocated for way smaller Government and less handouts, who also had some sort of noticeable presence in politics. Yes, and they were promptly marginalized by the media and political establishment and effectively removed from the political process. From the last 2 election cycles it should be crystal clear that any significant deviations from the political trend of increasing state power will be silenced, ignored, and marginalized; that is exactly what happened, grass-roots political organization does not work unless it compliments the existing political apparatus. 

Just look at the numbers from the last election: there was a turnout of 58.3%. Of those voting, 98.3% voted for Obama/Romney, while Gary Johnson got less than 1%, with the remainder going to morons like Jill Stein who advocate exponential increases to gov't spending. This means that less than 0.58% of the voting eligible population actually voted for ANY reduction in gov't spending.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012

This leads me to believe there is no hope for any sustained reduction of state power through electoral means. Not that there couldn't be a short-term gain here or there, but the overall trend is not changing at all.
 The main issue with any type of anti-state ideology for me is one of feasibility, there just is no way for it to actually come about. For such a radical change to come about, the existing state would have (a) willingly give up power, land, resources(...), or (b) suffer some sort of collapse to wrest away existing state power.

First, I'd say your arguments against the feasibility of anarchism apply as much or possibly more to minarchism. How to get there from here? That too would require the state to relinquish its power or be overthrown by a benign force.  
  
However, I think there's an other solution. I think the state can, against its will, fade slowly into irrelevancy. As the world turns more and more to the internet and other technologies antiquate the state's legal system, more and more of what we do ends up being out of the hands of the state.  
  
For example, 60 years ago, the state could have controlled the spread of information by controlling the (relatively) centralized press. Now, at least in the west, any attempt to suppress information from spreading would be absolutely futile.  
  
With the advent of digital currencies and access to online markets, we have more freedom from inflation than we did decades ago. Not to mention the ability to buy contraband online and have it shipped to my house relatively safely.  
  
The internet allows us to escape the violation of our property rights that are intellectual property monopolies. Even the most powerful entertainment lobbyists can't stop us from "stealing" their movies.  
  
The internet allows people to freely invest in their own human capital through online tutorials and courses to the extent that in new sectors (software especially), formal state education is less necessary.  
  
There are apps for our phones that allow average Joes/Janes to be  taxis in their spare time. This is just one example of the market breaking licensing cartels.  
  
Sorry for the rant. You get the picture I hope, The main issue with any type of anti-state ideology for me is one of feasibility, there just is no way for it to actually come about. For such a radical change to come about, the existing state would have (a) willingly give up power, land, resources(...), or (b) suffer some sort of collapse to wrest away existing state power.

Although Anarcho-Capitalism strikes me as a great idea, I'm skeptical that it could prevent the emergence of a state for much longer than a few years, perhaps only a few days, and that the emergent state would be a dictatorship, theocracy, or some other form of government that's worse than we have now.

Human nature is the main reason; my hunch is that there are enough people who will respond to forces other than the market, such as ideology, religion, perceived threats and panics, and that these non-market forces can be used to win enough popular support for a new establishment. Free market theory says that natural monopolies wouldn't last very long, but that brief window might be long enough for, say, a DRO and private police force to crown itself. There are many other doors for a new state to walk in through, such as Hofferesque mass movements, somebody organizing the "ostracized class", etc.

I'm also skeptical that the economic benefits of eliminating taxes and regulation would be realized, since to participate in society at the same level we do now would require many new forms of insurance and paid services (DROs, reputation brokers, more road tolls, community upkeep fees, etc.), plus the infrastructure to enforce them (gates, fences, surveillance, electronic IDs, etc.) In theory the market should make these services cheaper and more efficient than the state, but since we don't have a model AnCap society to examine it's not known if the net cost would be significantly lower than modern tax burdens.

Many of the conveniences and liberties we take for granted today, such as freedom of movement on public roads and sidewalks, parks and beaches, would also require technology that doesn't really exist yet, and might never. Verifying identity, insurance, DRO complicity, vaccination history, toll payment, contracts and so-on implies either lots of fences and guards, or some kind of electronic system. Some imagine using technologies such as RFID, but while this can enable the EZ-pass model for toll roads, it doesn't really work for the supermarket or shopping-mall model: humans are bags of dielectric fluid that can interrupt signals, and sensor technology for identifying warm bodies that went unscanned is not reliable. Face-scanning isn't anywhere near good enough, and is easy to fool. A supermarket would find a large number of unknowns on its property, raising its liability if some of them are uninsured problem makers. They could deal with this with more insurance, but there's your hidden taxes coming back again.

Then there's the ramifications of complete drug and firearm legalization. Guns I'm not worried about (I'm in favor of private gun ownership), but Surface-to-Air missiles concern me. Thanks to 9/11 and the need to keep hijacked jumbos far away from Chernobyl Reactor #4, SAMs will continue to be made, and presumably someone will offer them for sale to private buyers. If they proliferate, then air travel would be more interesting.

Since regulatory agencies like the FDA would be abolished, drugs like Thalidomide would hit the market. Some of the AnCap responses I've seen to this issue go along the lines of "your decision, your risk", but the victims of Thalidomide aren't the ones who chose to use it. My hunch is that pharma companies would overcome public distrust by spending almost the same amount of money on testing as currently required by regulations, if not more.

I'd love to hear responses to the above, though. I was working on an idea for a novel set in an AnCap society a while ago, and the above are some of the spots I got stuck on. Although Anarcho-Capitalism strikes me as a great idea, I'm skeptical that it could prevent the emergence of a state for much longer than a few years, perhaps only a few days, and that the emergent state would be a dictatorship, theocracy, or some other form of government that's worse than we have now.

I'd love to hear responses to the above, though. I was working on an idea for a novel set in an AnCap society a while ago, and the above are some of the spots I got stuck on.  I've never been a capitalist, but I am a former anarchist, and the reason I moved away from anarcho-syndicalism is essentially the same reason I don't support anarcho-capitalism. 

I think the vast majority of people are capable of peacefully interacting with each other without some higher authority to stop them from murdering people. The problem is that most people don't like responsibility. When something goes wrong, most people will immediately start looking for someone else to blame. Authority makes that easy, because if you were just following orders, then nothing that goes wrong is your fault, and you don't have to spend time and effort worrying about the consequences of your decisions. There's a minority of people, of course, who are more than happy to accept responsibility, and thus assume authority. In the absence of some pre-existing central authority, this process will continue until a new central authority emerges. Thus, whether states are good or bad is irrelevant. States are inevitable, so we might as well try to make them as beneficial as possible.         I was a deontological AnCap.

I kept searching for empirical evidence that would validate Austrian economics. After some research, I found that it didn't have as much as it should have for a deductive system. Therefore I abandoned Austrian economics and became agnostic regarding economics.

Then someday I realized that these deontological ethics weren't my ethics. Though I had no reason to keep calling me AnCap.  </snippet></document><document><title>The Sins of the Father: Pope Benedict&#8217;s Pedophile Protection Racket: "The Pope can freely badmouth capitalism, insult gays, and even give horrific health advice, but protecting rapists crosses a line no civilized society should tolerate."</title><url>http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/02/12/the-sins-of-the-father-pope-benedicts-pedophile-protection-racket/</url><snippet>  What is the general ancap view on the Vatican?

In contrast, I was reading about how many European's pay significantly less for superior internet services because the government forced large providers to allow smaller competitors to "piggy back" off of their own wires so consumers would have multiple choices. I can see what is wrong with that, but if it pushes down prices, why not try it? Any links that argue government is the cause of this please share.  I am a network engineer who designs wide area networks as well as Internet connectivity for a very large global corporation... been doing this since 1998, and been on the Internet since 1992.  I love these questions because it's the one time in here where I actually know what I'm talking about.

So when we talk about Internet connectivity, we're talking about a few things.  First is backbone connectivity.... secondly we're talking about connectivity out to the end user.  

ISPs will meet each other at common points to exchange traffic... these are typically done at Internet exchanges.  Amsterdam, New York, Dallas, SF/SJ Bay Area, Hong Kong, etc... these are places where your traffic may switch between Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T.  There tend to be a lot of ISPs and content providers all meeting at these faciliites, and as you would expect, competition drives prices down.  You also see much more bandwidth available there, newer features (IPv6), etc.... because a single upgrade can result in more potential sales.  

At these facilities I can purchase bandwidth dirt cheap... full transit for less than $1 / mbps for an emerging ISP and $5 / mbps for a solid global ISP.  This is what I'd pay in the US and western Europe.  Move over to Asia and it's  $15-25 / mbps, and in Brazil you're looking at $25 - $35 / mbps.  

So for me to start an ISP, if I'm in Amsterdam or NY... my costs to obtain bandwidth at the POP are roughly the same.  The issue is then how to get that bandwidth away from the POP and towards the end users.

This is something that obviously varies from region to region since telecommunications is so highly regulated.  But one thing that is common is that price is a function of distance as well as the available technology.  I can get bandwidth in Amsterdam, but if I need to transport it to Denmark, I'm going to eat some cost in that transport... whereas if I was bringing it to Utrecht, it'd be much less expensive.  With technology, if I'm dealing with an old telecom network, they are less efficient and tend to charge more for services.  If I can buy into a new network where everything is DWDM and Ethernet services over that, it tends to be much cheaper since they can squeeze more out of their investment.

So now I have my bandwidth in the city where I want to provide services.  I then have to figure out how to get that bandwidth to the house.  Look at Google Fiber... they're going through this in Kansas City now.  They understand that they need to recoup their investment and are not providing universal service.  They are only deploying where there is demand, where people will sign agreements in sufficient number to justify the deployment.  To roll a truck to hit one house in a neighborhood is a losing proposition... but if it hits 150 houses, it's a different story.

Your ILEC and MSO had advantages.... your ILEC has twisted pair copper in the ground to provide phone services, and your MSO has coax in the ground to provide cable tv.  Both of these can be modulated to carry IP data.  Some upgrades to infrastructure were required, but not only did they have cable in the ground, but they had oligopoly rights within the market to keep others out.

Now if you want to look at the difference between Europe and the US, hop in a plane and fly over and tell me what you see.  In the US there are cities along the eastern seaboard, along the great lakes and gulf coast... then not much until you hit the west coast.  You have an enormous amount of land with some population, and the rest is congregated in suburban and urban strips along the coast.  

If I'm providing services... am I going to backhaul bandwidth from Dallas to Roswell, NM and lay fiber out to 2000 homes, none of which are close together?  Or would I just stick with Dallas and hit 150,000 homes with the same effort?  

Population density and geographic coverage are HUGE factors in why the landscape is different in Internet speeds.  Why should a person living in New York pay the same for their ISP than someone in Roswell?  It costs a ton more to run that connection out to Roswell.

Amsterdam, New York, Dallas, SF/SJ Bay Area, Hong Kong, etc... these are places where your traffic may switch between Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T.  There tend to be a lot of ISPs and content providers all meeting at these faciliites, and as you would expect, competition drives prices down.  You also see much more bandwidth available there, newer features (IPv6), etc.... because a single upgrade can result in more potential sales.  

At these facilities I can purchase bandwidth dirt cheap... full transit for less than $1 / mbps for an emerging ISP and $5 / mbps for a solid global ISP.  This is what I'd pay in the US and western Europe.  Move over to Asia and it's  $15-25 / mbps, and in Brazil you're looking at $25 - $35 / mbps.  

So for me to start an ISP, if I'm in Amsterdam or NY... my costs to obtain bandwidth at the POP are roughly the same.  The issue is then how to get that bandwidth away from the POP and towards the end users.

This is something that obviously varies from region to region since telecommunications is so highly regulated.  But one thing that is common is that price is a function of distance as well as the available technology.  I can get bandwidth in Amsterdam, but if I need to transport it to Denmark, I'm going to eat some cost in that transport... whereas if I was bringing it to Utrecht, it'd be much less expensive.  With technology, if I'm dealing with an old telecom network, they are less efficient and tend to charge more for services.  If I can buy into a new network where everything is DWDM and Ethernet services over that, it tends to be much cheaper since they can squeeze more out of their investment.

So now I have my bandwidth in the city where I want to provide services.  I then have to figure out how to get that bandwidth to the house.  Look at Google Fiber... they're going through this in Kansas City now.  They understand that they need to recoup their investment and are not providing universal service.  They are only deploying where there is demand, where people will sign agreements in sufficient number to justify the deployment.  To roll a truck to hit one house in a neighborhood is a losing proposition... but if it hits 150 houses, it's a different story.

Your ILEC and MSO had advantages.... your ILEC has twisted pair copper in the ground to provide phone services, and your MSO has coax in the ground to provide cable tv.  Both of these can be modulated to carry IP data.  Some upgrades to infrastructure were required, but not only did they have cable in the ground, but they had oligopoly rights within the market to keep others out.

Now if you want to look at the difference between Europe and the US, hop in a plane and fly over and tell me what you see.  In the US there are cities along the eastern seaboard, along the great lakes and gulf coast... then not much until you hit the west coast.  You have an enormous amount of land with some population, and the rest is congregated in suburban and urban strips along the coast.  

If I'm providing services... am I going to backhaul bandwidth from Dallas to Roswell, NM and lay fiber out to 2000 homes, none of which are close together?  Or would I just stick with Dallas and hit 150,000 homes with the same effort?  

Population density and geographic coverage are HUGE factors in why the landscape is different in Internet speeds.  Why should a person living in New York pay the same for their ISP than someone in Roswell?  It costs a ton more to run that connection out to Roswell.

...to be continued... You touched on regulations briefly, but hopefully you will expand more on that. Aside from that, not considering the rural areas, why is internet service still much more expensive than European counterparts in large cities? Is that price compensating for the areas where they do not make as much money (the rural areas). Great post by the way.
 Europe is more densely populated in general, even moreso than most US cities.  There could also be subsidies in play as well... I don't deal with delivering residential services, only on the enterprise side of the house... so I don't know those specifics.

But in most major metro areas you can get 30 mbps service for less than $75 a month... which is really not expensive.  

What cracks me up is hearing people on reddit whine about something not being fast enough, which makes one wonder what the heck they are doing.  You can stream a compressed 1080p video stream with audio at 4 mbps with decent quality.  To me there's no difference between 20 mbps and 500 mbps... there are no realtime applications which need that much bandwidth today.  The only thing that I can think of is downloading files from newsgroups or doing bittorrent... and wanting your file in 3 minutes instead of 9 minutes.   It's amazing how much bandwidth a family can suck up without even realizing it.

I was recently visiting my folks and noticed how we were all online using copious amounts of bandwidth. I had a couple files on bittorrent, while watching a movie with a friend on skype, my little brother was on a vent server talking to his friends while playing WoW, my mom was on facebook while streaming music off Pandora, and my stepdad was also watching Netflix in the front room. Needless to say, there were more than a few hiccups.  &amp;gt;I had a couple files on bittorrent

Likely source of your problem.

&amp;gt;Needless to say, there were more than a few hiccups.

Could have been due to limited upstream bandwidth.  If you can't get your ACKs back to the servers, you're going to notice some issues.  

Netflix will use 2-3 mbps.  Pandora can use 160 kbps or so.  VoIP will use between 30-85 kbps.  Skype at 720p uses 1152 kbps.  All in all, in that scenario you'd top out at less than 5 mbps excluding bittorrent.

When I ordered cablemodem service for my parents, who unknowingly use streaming video and do light e-mail and facebook, I picked the 15 mbps service over the 3 mbps service because they could have two streams going at once... and it was only $10/mo more.  I don't disagree that 15 is better than 5... I'm just saying that 150 is really no better than 50.  Unless you are downloading massive files via bittorrent and newsgroups... and is that really something to be crying about? You touched on regulations briefly, but hopefully you will expand more on that. Aside from that, not considering the rural areas, why is internet service still much more expensive than European counterparts in large cities? Is that price compensating for the areas where they do not make as much money (the rural areas). Great post by the way.

You're right.  If we look at it as a whole, it's a bad investment at the time.  Wireless could solve a lot of those problems if spectrum were freed up.  And if you look at denser urban and suburban areas, prices really aren't that bad.  I've got 45 mbps down, 25 mbps up at my house... and I pay 1/4 what I did for 128 kbps 7 years ago which was my only option in a rural area.

...to be continued...  Continuing.

In providing residential services, the last mile is the great hurdle.  As I mentioned earlier, the regulated services already had some infrastructure to build upon and access to right-of-way to lay fiber as needed.  Your mom &amp;amp; pop ISP don't have this luxury.  It's very costly to dig, then maintain.

The great equalizer is wireless.  I'm not talking about 802.11 in your home which was made for medium range wireless communications, but rather 802.16 (WiMax) or LTE which were developed for mobile or fixed wireless longhaul applications.  These are both capable of providing broadband speeds across distances of 5-35 miles.

The issue is that there is an artificial shortage of free spectrum for these devices.  Look at your wireless router or cordless phone... they operate either at 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, or 5.8 GHz.  These are all ISM bands which have few channels at the appropriate widths to be useful.  The frequencies are also problematic for long haul applications.

In general the higher the frequency, the more directional the signal and more problems it will have penetrating foliage and building materials.  Using 5.8 GHz in a point to point configuration where there is clear line of sight works well... but in a fixed wireless tower scenario, in most geographies, it just doesn't work well at all.  Then at 900 MHz, you're at a low enough frequency to get through most foliage, but the channel width maximum is 26 MHz, using a single channel, yielding 12-15 mbps maximum.  That just doesn't scale for a wireless ISP.

Now imagine you had free use of spectrum and could put up a tower and divide it into sectors and each sector would operate at a different frequency and each had 50 MHz of channel width... all at around 700 MHz... you'd be rocking and rolling providing 30 mbps service to 25 square mile zones.  Rolling hills and foliage wouldn't be show stoppers.

But today nearly all spectrum is licensed.  There's a huge barrier to enter the market.  And guess who wins the bids on new spectrum leases?  The incumbents like Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T and Deutsche Telekom.  There's no huge incentive for them to provide fixed wireless broadband at reasonable speeds and prices... they'd be pillaging their own customers for wired service.   Maybe I should talk about wireless spectrum on Decline to State one of these days... Actually the whole issue of utilities might be enough to get us through a show.

Would you be willing to come on and talk about this stuff perchance? Sure.  Another interesting aspect is how the Internet evolved due to open standards and self governance.    What? How could you not find the evidence of exclusive government contracts and regulations? What do you think is holding Google back? This industry is a perfect example of government getting in the way of innovation. It took all of 5 seconds to find these links:

   To me it looks more like collusion between large companies.  Wouldn't it be better to truly research the cause rather than deciding what it is and only looking for that supports your opinion? I have done research concerning both sides of the coin but I know licensing laws have some say in the problem, and if they don't, a person arguing in favor of more regulation would refute this reasoning, but I cannot find anything. Collusion could be another symptom of licensing since the established corporations do not have to worry about any new competitors due to the barrier of entry. To me it looks more like collusion between large companies.  Wouldn't it be better to truly research the cause rather than deciding what it is and only looking for that supports your opinion?  I think some anarcho caps pretend there are never any possible benefits to the state. This does not seem generally true. However if the state has the power to lower prices in his way it has the power to do other bad things. Which it will eventually do. Slightly lower internet prices is not a justification for state force. Even on a utilitarian argument it fails. The potential costs are extremely high (might stifle innovation down the line, or set up a monopoly) and outweigh the benefits. Benefits compared to what? For every benefit the state provides someone, they are hurting or stealing from someone else, there are no net positives. Not per se true. Money invested in one place may yield a greater all-round return than money invested in another. This is obvious when you consider somebody investing in a venture that will ultimately fail. In this case, if the State forced him to invest in something else, he could potentially reap high gains, as would others in the market. The problem is, this is an isolated hypothetical. We have no way of necessarily knowing what the results would have been if the State didn't force him to invest in B and instead allowed his investment in venture A. And even if we presume the State's call in this particular case, the consequences of such State involvement *generally* are overwhelmingly likely to be negative. Isn't it wrong to look at the individual rather than the market as a whole though?  

If we are all standing near a cliff and don't realize the danger of walking too close to the edge there are a few scenarios which can play out.  

We can all get lucky and no one walks too close and no one gets hurt.  


Or one of us can walk too close, fall, and serve as an example to the rest of us.  While it's horrible for that individual, the group as a whole learns a valuable lesson.


Or the individual could get close, realize the danger by looking down, and step back on his own.  While looking down they may have also caught a glimpse of fruit which would be worth the risk of venturing further.  


In my eyes the intervention of the state means there is is a limit to the downside, but more importantly, a limit to the upside of an action.  But in all cases it limits the information fed into the market due to those limitations.  I agree. However it still remains that a single State intervention is not *per se* bad for the market, even on the whole, if looked at as an *isolated incident*. It is pretty likely to be so, but it is not a definite, and there's no empirical way of knowing. I wouldn't see a loss of freedom in exchange for an economic return as a net positive really. . . So? Somebody else might. Say, a utilitarian perhaps. Somebody might? How about you, would you be willing to say that? No, I wouldn't, even on utilitarian grounds. What the hell's your issue?</snippet></document><document><title>AI prescribes cheaper and more effective treatment than doctors.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why would Ron Paul claim he has a right to ronpaul.com over any other ron Paul? Or Ronp Aul? He just doesn't want to pay for it. 

&amp;gt; The website's content is directly about the politician Ron Paul, and not about any other ron paul.

&amp;gt; Furthermore, if the rules of the private ICANN organization provide for this claim, then there's nothing wrong with what Ron Paul is doing, as everyone involved voluntarily agreed to these rules beforehand.

Also:

&amp;gt; Within the context of the domain registration agreement (contract) that the holders of ronpaul.com agreed to, Ron Paul is making a claim using the correct dispute resolution process. This isn't about ownership or intellectual property - its a contract dispute.

&amp;gt; No one can "own" an ICANN-registered domain, they only have license to it for a specific term and under specific requirements. You can never own anything you have to register. Whether or not your concede that the quasi-private firm and contract disputes within are justified under the NAP, Ron Paul still shouldn't be doing this. Not only does it make him look extremely bad, hypocritical and idiotic to those who are unfamiliar with the nuance of his beliefs, but it's just not cricket. He's giving a huge fuck you to the grass-roots, which is his bread and butter. More like [*Ron Paul* was receiving a big "fuck you"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/18difb/israel_from_ronpaulflixcomron_paul_has_not_gone/c8dxw4d). It isn't a one way street. RonPaul.com has been a major part of grass-roots support for Ron Paul, and promoting his message. They have agreed to give him RonPaul.org, which they have PAID FOR, absolutely **free of charge**. They are not domain squatting. They have already outlines why simply giving away RonPaul.com would inconvenience many and even break an enormous array of links.

As to them agreeing to a contract, I find it highly questionable whether such a contract can be considered totally binding considering the monopoly privilege granted to the particular organisation in question. &amp;gt; RonPaul.com has been a major part of grass-roots support for Ron Paul, and promoting his message.

I doubt it.

&amp;gt; giving away RonPaul.com would inconvenience many and even break an enormous array of links.

Too bad they didn't work with Ron Paul to ensure a redirection service be implemented.

Squatters are always inconvenienced when they're finally pushed off private property.

&amp;gt; monopoly privilege granted to the particular organisation in question.

Have they abused this position ? &amp;gt;Squatters are always inconvenienced when they're finally pushed off private property.

How are they squatting?

&amp;gt;Have they abused this position?

I have no idea, it's not terribly relevant. [Squatters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting).

It's relevant because only abuse matters under the law. [Squatters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting).

It's relevant because only abuse matters under the law. &amp;gt;Squatting consists of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied area of land and/or a building &#8211; usually residential &#8211;[1] *that the squatter does not own, rent or otherwise have lawful permission to use.*

Yeeeah. They purchased the domain and then subsequently homesteaded it... So from both a fiat and non-fiat perspective, they have legal ownership and/or tenancy of the domain. Property is whatever you can defend. Given that the squatters agreed to ICANN's rules, Ron Paul has ICANN to come to his defense without initiating violence.

I.P. is actually quite heavily enforced in the fashion industry.  Many clothing innovations have been, and still are patented.  Using trademarks to entrap copiers is a another form of IP enforcement.  Counterfeiters, including replica products who are honest &amp;amp;  direct that their products are replicas, are regularly shut down, sued, and blocked from engaging in commerce.

The TED video also ignores several important questions like "who benefits" and "what about the innovators" and "how much innovation is there really?"  Lastly, there are numerous other factual inaccurcies and misleading statements (i.e. her claims about the car industry), but overall the TED video is so badly researched that that anyone who uses it as a reference has clearly not done any outside research.

The way copyright law works, is the copyright is automatically assigned to the author on creation. You register the copyright if you (a) wish to create a record of the work or (b) sue another party for infringement, however registration is not required for copyright. Further, one cannot simply "copyright" someone else's artwork.

It's right there in plain text in Title 17.

No, the Mises institute is not forced to copyright their work.  That's also factually inaccurate.

Yes, Kinsella and Tucker used to say that, but Kinsella recently stopped *(after having been called out on it many times).*

Publishers only own the work if the copyright (or "title") is transferred to the publisher, usually implying some sort of payment or compensation for that.

why do you make the equivocation that copying something or expanding off of som1 else's work without their permission is equal to stealing car parts? what justifies the property right to car parts and what justifies property of ideas?  &amp;gt; *"what justifies the property right to car parts and what justifies property of ideas?"*

I attribute "who owns" to "the one who produced that value," and there are many reasons for this including incentives, return on investment, economics, allocation of resources, ethics *(my subjective)*, balanced relationships, cooperation, wealth production, creativity, and more.  I don't expect all to share all of my values, but intangible and tangible property fit fairly well.

What's your answer?   Patents is who invented it first, it isn't who can get to the patent office first.  Patents is who invented it first, it isn't who can get to the patent office first.  I'm less familiar with patents, but they also said "Copyrights" in the same breath, which I KNOW is inaccurate.

The way copyright law works, is the copyright is automatically assigned to the author on creation.  You register the copyright if you (a) wish to create a record of the work or (b) sue another party for infringement, however registration is not required for copyright.  Further, one cannot simply "copyright" someone else's artwork.

It's right there in plain text in Title 17. &amp;gt;I'm less familiar with patents, but they also said "Copyrights" in the same breath, which I KNOW is inaccurate.

Yeah I noticed that too, but just spoke on patents since that is how it used to be, but it changed. Kinda shows they might not really know what they are talking about when it comes to IP, not that I'm a specialist or anything. Yeah I'm aware that copyright is automatically assigned and I'm surprised that they didn't know that.  Patents is who invented it first, it isn't who can get to the patent office first.
