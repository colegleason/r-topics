Weren't they supposedly running a contest for the logo? I think Jill Arena created the logo, she's an illustrator and designer. So they must have ended up with free illustration. Not sure of the details though. Expect to see it on the lightpoles up there in Jeff Park would be my guess. It's well done, I just dislike that building.  I kinda like the old logo with all the trees. I was once in the social security office way on the top of that building.

http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/bacp/disciplinaractions/liquorlicrevocations02012013.pdf I think what I read a couple months ago - they didn't have the cash to renew and clearly don't have rent $$ now. They tried to make the best of it...if you bring your own tequila or rum - they will sell you the mixing's (virgin) for a mojito or margarita.   Hopefully they will make it but 17 years is a respectable run.  Diners are fickle and there is a lot of competition.  I think that has more to do with things than a heat wave or festivals. now you now sound like my husband who doesn't seem the least bit upset (he and i had our 1st date there!) and said exactly that - 17 years is a long run for restaurant.  which if i am understanding you men.. is code for get over it.  i get it :).

I thought that was the strangest solicitation and never even considered buying meat from the back of a white van -- but others there said they buy all of their meat from another vendor named "Jesse".  They raved about restaurant quality, delicious marinades and the convenience of delivery.  Have I been missing something?  Do you buy meat from the back of a van?   Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality. Yeah it's common. They stop at ginmills too. Try something simple like a ribeye first to judge his quality.  I've had a meat van guy come to my front door. He got pissy with me when I told him no. "Wat'sa matter, buddy, don't you eat meat?! I could see the van parked down the street. It had the name of the company and a picture of various meat products so I felt he was legit. OTH, we occasionally get guys cruising the alley in unmarked cars selling it out of their trunks. As much as I love a good cut of meat, I'm not about to stand over some strange guy's car trunk parked in the alley. But yet you trust some bigass store's styrofoam platter and Saran wrap presentation. At least from the trunk you can put the meat up to your nose and also smell the cooler they are using to carry it around in.  Got word that the meat van is rolling thru today -- I'm lined up to buy a box of steaks.  Woo hooo!! Let us know what cuts you buy and your critique of their product. Exactly - want to hear about it!  I want a meat van to come by my place...   Very common in the city. Usually they say its extra boxes leftover etc. I figure they just buy it cheap and hustle. I've seen small sedans packed with white boxes driving around.
    
 Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Alright at least a van could be refrigerated -- but buy from a car trunk?  What's up with that?   Yup, Ive never bought from them, especially since they do this in the summer heat... However I hear the meats good, prices are decent too. Ill probably roll the dice one of these days.   After reading this thread...I'm almost embarrassed to say that every once in awhile we buy meat from some traveling salesman.  They generally show up on Friday afternoon.  Knock on the door - tell us about all our neighbors buying this way.  Seem to have an official looking van.  Fail. If the van is refrigerated and the meat was good quality, I don't think it's a fail at all!  Aside from someone trying to sell me shrimp out of the trunk of a Buick on 95th and Ashland, I'm embarrassed to say I've just never been exposed to the traveling meat purveyor.  I gotta get out more! :) - it seems like good stuff - no complaints!  That and Costco...my meat buying experiences.  I'm going to send them your way next time....:) I'm going to hunt down this Jesse guy who works Milwaukee Avenue over here.  The ladies at the salon highly recommend him.  I probably wouldn't even open the door if one of these guys showed up unexpectedly at my door.  I'm a Costco freakoid.  The traveling meat van is a bit pricey (despite all the claims of restaurant quality).  I do better @ Costco - but laziness kick in at times and the convenience factor, Friday afternoon, tired and hungry, etc - cave.   I would like to meet Jessie - he might be better!

Interesting comment by Brendan Diamond about DNA too. Besides this subject, I'm also not impressed with DNAInfo's "surprisingly gullible and shortsighted reporting" on other matters either, such as when they gloss over the criminal ties of some when they become "victims" of their own gang activity. I'll take the various neighborhood coverage though. No one else is covering local news like they are. Use the pull down for the various neighborhood areas and you get timely news no place else is covering. I navigate that website just fine, thanks. And they don't cover anything of consequence in Albany/Old Irving/Portage/Jefferson/Norwood Parks any better than Nadig does.

It also appears that Carranza's attempt (with the help of Pa Ricketts' toy, DNAInfo) to get in front of the NEWS posted at the top with a what was essentially a press release has failed. dna and nadig are two different beasts. you only get nadig material once a week on your porch and very little of it has a URL. dna is updated daily and obviously covers the whole city. Living here in Portage it's easy to keep up with Albany, Irving, Belmont Cragin and Hermosa, places that ring us here. Obviously you're a booster of DNA and what passes for "reporting" there. That's your perogative. I consider them sub-par at what they do. Carry on....... Obviously you're a booster of DNA and what passes for "reporting" there. That's your perogative. I consider them sub-par at what they do. Carry on....... I dunno about booster, but I see it as a resource. Here's the AM routine:

heat skillet
open http://dnainfo.com, read front page
place egg in skillet, cook usually sunnyside up
drop bread in toaster
peel a banana slice onto plate
plate egg and toast
pour a little OJ or pmoegranate juice
peruse both nytimes and dna whilst masticating
get more coffee

then the day starts "all or parts of the venue have recently been closed by inspectors" LOL.

Interesting comment by Brendan Diamond about DNA too. Have a look see at the most recent comments on the blog page. A familar name is of the opinion that there should be no oversight of public safety at a privately owned business.

Anybody have any recommendations? Repair or replace?   Tough to say without pics but not often reparable.   Do you know of an honest wheel guy?  I've never had occasion to require the services of one, but I've found this.

http://www.chicagowheelrepair.com/

 That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E. That's where I took it. $100 and out in under 2 hours. Not how I imagined spending a sick day at work. Thanks, B the E.  i assume the rim job included remounting and rebalance of the wheel and it was done in less then a couple hours, seems like a good deal, if you got a rim from the junkyard and had to remount the tire and rebalance it, it would probably be close to the same price and more time spent going the junkyard route. Rim job?  Is the wheel steel or aluminum? Steel is fixable most of the time. Aluminum Is very risky to fix, so much that not a lot of shops will fix them.  go here in the neighborhood:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago While they do not repair wheels or straighten bent rims, it is a worthwhile place for used OEM replacement wheels at a decent price or to have a flat fixed. I go elsewhere for everything else. once a rim is bent you'd really want to just replace it, not knock it back into shape then mount a tire on it. Depending on the extent of the damage, they are quite repairable in the hands of a skilled tech with the right equipment. and where would we find one of these guys around here to work on a stock steel rim or an alloy one?

Also how do you "bend a rim" and not do other suspension or steering damage? go here in the neighborhood:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/majestic-tirestore-rim-and-hub-caps-chicago I always go to Majestic.  Be prepared that it doesn't have the spit shine of Firestone or Sears, but the prices and service are great. I always go to Majestic.

Here's the first peep we're hearing from Eddie Carranza in the local news. They've been laying low until now:

http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130221/logan-square/congress-theater-owner-wants-restore-it-its-1920s-glory  Wow Jazmine has a fancy new title -- projects manager.  Fitting because the Congress reminds one of the projects.  I like how Eddie compares his security team selling confiscated drugs to a speeding ticket. There was some interesting stuff in the /r/Chicago post about the drug selling at the Congress when it all blew up last month. There was someone in the post mentioning how security gave him and/or a friend a "pass" to sell drugs in the theater.

Eddie's got a serious uphill battle with the City at this point. This would be one of them.

http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/16orza/congress_theater_eddie_carranza_one_big_load_of/

Pay special attention to the hidden comments that "score below the threshold". Wow Jazmine has a fancy new title -- projects manager.  Fitting because the Congress reminds one of the projects.  I like how Eddie compares his security team selling confiscated drugs to a speeding ticket. Wow the article was altered to remove the speeding ticket comment and make it seem like he takes the violations more seriously. Since the author (as opposed to "reporter") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously. Don't make judgement yet. Victoria the writer said to me she didn't alter the original article. she's asking her editors. Doesn't matter whether it was the author OR the editors. It was altered. I've asked who and why and will post what I find out.  It was kind of a puff piece anyway. Boy was it ever. There was opportunity for a good follow up when the pr person said that at least the bathroom ceilings weren't caving in:  "what kind of structural work have you done on the theater?" Because that kind of news would be useful. Painting a few places or swapping out some drywall isn't what I would consider major work - it's cosmetic. But if the cosmetics were delayed all this time because they needed to go in and fix structural things, that would be something I could respect. But that's not what we got in this piece, and it's the second puff piece out of DNAinfo on this subject. I wonder if they require their writers to have journalism degrees. Since the author (as opposed to "reporter") decided to edit out quotes they took from Carranza himself (presumably at his request...a hearing is coming up afterall), I must stop taking that news site seriously. He is known for saying provocative things, but maybe he saw how cavalier it looked in print.  </snippet></document><document><title>Fish Fraud</title><url>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-phony-fish-20130221,0,7726323.story</url><snippet>   i guess this was posted just for the "halibut" You have sole. i have a "tun-a' sole" and i practice what i perch I was gonna say don't perch to the coral, but it sounded crappie. holy mackerel, it is not that bad, it is not like you have a "big mouth" or something.

I'm familiar with, and lived in, Irving Park before but further west on the other side of the expressway and my only ventures over this way are to restaurants and the park.

The WBEZ gang map says this is prime "Simon City Royals" territory and while I take that with a grain of salt (apparently I have spent the last 10 years living in various gang territories without issue) I have a friend who used to live on Kimball there and said it was bad: lots of crime, gunshots, and gang activity.  Walking around at night was a no-no.

The street the house is on seems nice: well taken care of homes and lawns, no trash, and quiet.  I get the impression that a lot of the people who live there are older with kids or seniors.

Anyone know what it's really like? The plan is to live in the house for a long time and I walk a lot.  Disclaimer: I don't live *exactly* there. I'm north of Montrose, but only one block and I walk down Hamlin to Elston fairly often. The crime really isn't that bad in this area in general. Before I moved to Albany Park, everyone was warning me about gangs. I have never once had to worry about anything here and I have (stupidly) stumbled home drunk at 3 a.m. a few times (which I don't recommend).

Almost all gang violence is gang-on-gang in this area. Very rarely do non-gang-members get shot. It is kind of quiet in the area, but I love it here. I am planning on moving to the other side of Kimball soon just to be closer to the 'L' but other than that, I have zero issues here.

EDIT: Also, you'd get to live in a place that's in the Albany Park neighborhood and the Irving Park community area. My first time in the area, I got kind of confused about which was which. Awesome, thank you.  I figured it's like most places: there's crime because it's a city and that's just how things are.  My friend's first hand account had me worried on top of the huge orange box of HEY THERE'S A GANG THERE from WBEZ.  Not so much concerned about a random drive by as feeling like I'm trapped in my home from living in a shitty environment, which is how I feel now over in Albany Park. No problem. Hope that helps.

So you currently live in AP and don't like the environment? Can I ask which side you live on? I'm between Lawrence and Foster, off Kedzie.  My main beef is that it's ridiculously trashy, as in, garbage everywhere on the streets.  My ten minute walk to the brown line is like walking through a landfill and I've watched people leave bottles or trash on the sidewalks.  People don't care about their homes, lawns, cars, businesses, nothing.  It just feels run down and like everyone gave up.  I moved over here thinking I could go for walks like I did in Irving, go to the park by the river, but I just feel depressed looking outside.  The area west to Kimball looks much nicer but between Fransisco and Kedzie it's kind of a shithole. Good to know. My block is hit and miss. I'm off of Central Park near Sunnyside and it's block by block here. I generally don't go north of Lawrence. I'm mostly on Kedzie or Lawrence, or walking to the Brown Line from here. But yeah, the trash can suck sometimes.  I think EB Chris lives over by dere, maybe he will weigh in. I meant Chris from EB.  He says it's much better than it was two years ago.

 I'm travelling this week, will write more when I return. Yes, I live in the heart of that area, and have as a single family home owner for 5 years now. Prior I lived as a renter in Logan for 13 years.

I like it for the most part. 2 years ago though, we had some bad problems, mainly confined to 4000 block of Bernard, and 4100 block of Monticello, all gang related.

SCR's are so weak now its a joke. Most active gang is SGD, and they are active, though have now taken more root north of Montrose.

Our area has been very quiet now for a year, honest.

We have a VERY strong neighborhood group in these boundaries that is purely anti crime, IPCNA, meets monthly.

Being able to walk to tony's for grcoceries, by gadren supplies at garden center, walk to blue line, home depot and target nearby are god sends.

The biggest ongoing trouble area is north side of Montrose ans Kimball and cullom corner.

That help. Please don't hesitate asking anything you can think of, just be patient on my response as I'm travelling. But I am very active in community and caps and can give you the low down.

This thread is an attempt to reconstitute that resource, for my benefit and hopefully others who find their way here. This is a big-time home improvement job that many are no doubt considering.

I'll go first.

I had Xpert Flood Control come out and scope out my sewer. It was mercifully clear of roots and remarkably intact all the way to the street, no cracks or shifts or anything. Hurray! I asked for a quote on a flood control system and they presented me with The Cadillac as I refer to it, a $7600 package with more valves and electric pumps than I could shake a stick at.

I'm looking for a cheaper, simpler option. Just a valve on my sewer line, with an access point in my yard so I can pop it open if it gets stuck. Called REI Plumbing (the only one I could remember from the old EB thread) twice and haven't yet received a return call.

Any suggestions for who to call? </snippet></document><document><title>Chicago Fringe Festival coming to Jeff Park</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18wzex/chicago_fringe_festival_coming_to_jeff_park/</url><snippet>Just in from TimeOut Chicago, Chicago Fringe Festival is moving from Pilsen to....Jefferson Park.

How many people pick their neighborhoods and pay higher rents for superficial things that don't really matter?

"I previously chose my neighborhood based on other factors that hold little weight in my day-to-day life. I wanted people young and shops new and nightlife energy in abundance."  One of my kids just signed a lease in "Roscoe Village" today. She fits a local demographic. She wouldn't live here near us if I paid half the rent. We've all been there.  It's funny that the age group who can afford it the least pays the most. Isn't the 25-30% rule out the window in 2013? And 25-year-olds can tolerate roommates. I married my room mate.

she still complains about picking up my socks 30 years after the fact Maybe the 30 years of socks situation contributed to your daughter's shift to Roscoe Village?   BTW, what demographic does she fit there?  My son living there points out that at least half the renters are from Ohio.  Ditto report from another son living in Bucktown.  Also BTW, they tend to come home when the laundry bag gets big and a fee meal is in sight. I think it's the mid-20's demographic and wanting to live amongst people closer to her age. People over by here are old and jaded with nothing going on. Speak for yourself.:) I think it's the mid-20's demographic and wanting to live amongst people closer to her age.
