It makes people feel more safe in their own lives by victim blaming because the thought that anyone could be hurt or victimized, even smart, cautious competent people (like themselves, self esteem woo) would be a source of constant anxiety otherwise It's also an issue with a simplistic view of extremes. Everything is either good/bad, right/wrong. So if any behavior is even a little wrong, it's completely wrong. No grey area, no situational awareness, and that's that. Whenever we are faced with two wrongs, we only pick one as "more wrong" so it's the only wrong. If two guys punch each other we put blame on who instigated it, who threw the first punch, or who didn't prevent it from happening/continuing. Once we have the one person to blame all other blames are void. When it's simply, it's his fault he punched me and it's my fault I punch him. One behavior does not excuse, justify, or cancel out another.  [deleted] Just took an exam on this in social psych.

But ill keep it short. A girl goes to a party, she's wearing revealing clothing, flirting with the boys, even dancing provocatively, and drinking. As the night goes on she becomes intoxicated and increasingly rambunctious. When her friend wanted to leave the girl told her go ahead she wanted to stay and have fun. One of the boys overheard a few guys talking about how drunk she was getting and her "easy" behavior. They proceed to keep giving her drinks, dancing and having a good time. At the end of the night two guys begin to carry her upstairs while the remaining guests were fooling around. She awoke the next morning naked in a strange man's bed with the realization of what must have happened.

Who's to blame for her rape?

Everyone. Each person in that story had the chance to prevent it from happening. No one has control of another person's actions, no one's actions justifies or circumvents anothers, and we are all responsible for our defense against the bad elements in life and our behavior in society. The men are rapist deserving of punishment, some party members can be seen as accessories, the friend could have stayed or driven her home, the boy could have warned others of the overheard conversation, the party goers could have prevented her from being taken upstairs, but no one put her in that party, no one forced alcohol down her throat, no one put her in that outfit, or made her behave in a sexually appealing manner in good fun. 

There are horrible things happening to people and its the victim burden to defend against and avoid them.
Victim shaming and abuser shaming are two sides to the same coins. Uhh... Wouldn't the people who raped her be at fault? Wtf is 'abuser shaming' ? 

A person can act as "sexually appealing" as they want to, wear nothing at all and be the drunkest person in a room but if they do not consent to sex then there's no grey area. Rapists are at fault for rape. Yes as stated the rapists are at fault for the rape. They caused it to happen. Victim shame stems from the ability to prevent it from happening. I would take any action possible to prevent the rape then simply punishing it after the fact. A women should be able to walk down the street completely drunk, naked, and pass out where ever she wants and wake up unharmed and unmolested. But that's not reality, and the is no way to keep a person from seeing vulnerability and exploiting it. I know bad people exist so I try my best to not get fucked over by them, its not a sure thing but I'd rather trust my judgment then theirs. 
 Abuser shame is the attack against abusive people to publicly shame the behavior. In hopes one day people will stop attacking each other. But until that day its my burden to protect myself from them, even if it means changing my desired behavior. Right, but there is a fine line between victim shame and 'taking action to prevent things from happening'. 

YES, there are obviously things you can do to make yourself more safe, such as staying with a trusted friend, not drinking too much and making sure to keep your bearings. But what happens when those things don't happen? Does hindsight provide any helpful insight whatsoever? you shouldn't have gotten so drunk, you shouldn't have acted so "sexually appealing" (WTF does that even mean), you shouldn't have been wearing this outfit, etc etc.

But does that help? Is that helpful at all? If she wasn't wearing a party dress (like, you know, every other girl in the party) would she not have been raped? If she wasn't acting in a "sexually appealing" manner would she not have been raped if she was already passing out from alcohol?


I've seen tons of girls pass out at parties and they haven't gotten raped. I've seen lots of women dressed in tiny party dresses and they are no worse off during a party. I've seen LOTS of people overdrink and get sloppy drunk and they are not sexually assaulted. 


Do you know why some women are sexually assaulted and not others? It's not the clothing, it's not "how sexually appealing" their behavior is and it's not their drunkenness. There is no rape barometer where all the factors you listed (drunk +1, revealing outfit +1, 'sexual behavior' +1) come into play to make someone more or less likely to be raped.

Do you know what makes someone likely to be raped? The fact that there is a rapist at the party, that's what. 

&amp;gt;I know bad people exist so I try my best to not get fucked over by them, its not a sure thing but I'd rather trust my judgment then theirs.

And this in itself is the concept behind victim blaming. Because while you can think all you want that rape happens only to girls who dress provocatively and are public lushes and act "sexually appealing" it is not true. It can happen to anyone, and as much as it pains you to admit it there's not much you can do to prevent a horrible crime from happening once an abuser decides they want to harm you.



 There are no promises with life and I'm in no means trying to defend the guilty and shame the innocent. To put it simply I've known just too many victims of rape, every girlfriend, most of my gal friends... I can't even watch a movie with a rape scene in it with out relapsing into a bottle. But from a man's perspective, when the guys I'm with wanna get laid they look for girl they will have the highest success rate with. I mean simple fun consenting sex, no more pervy then her. But they look for certain behaviors, attitudes, level of friskiness, and how drunk she is. And if are catching his attention your and getting the rapists attention. And they are so sick and twisted they'll have themselves convinced you want it to happen to. You didn't do anything to deserve it, its not always preventable, and he is always the one at fault. When you are pass out drunk in a room full of drunk/horny boys you are completely at their mercy, and I just don't have that level of trust in humanity. I don't even fully trust myself not to do something stupid like drive home when that drunk, and I sure as shit wouldn't trust any man around my friends when she gets too drunk not even her boyfriends. Yes as stated the rapists are at fault for the rape. They caused it to happen. Victim shame stems from the ability to prevent it from happening. I would take any action possible to prevent the rape then simply punishing it after the fact.

Victim shaming and abuser shaming are two sides to the same coins. Rapists are always to blame for rape. Jesus fucking christ. Your scenario includes *carrying a girl upstairs to rape her*. The girl who had to be *carried* somewhere is obviously not at fault. Ugh. 

I've been to lots of parties with drinking. I've had lots of night out in sexy attire. I have been sexually assaulted *once* and the reason was that one of my trusted friends was a creepy scumbag. It is not the way I dressed or any innocuous actions on *my* part that contributed to my experience - it was the presence of a predator. That's not something we can easily foresee or control. OK, I am in no way saying rapist aren't rapists. Its a preventive action arguement. I drew up in a small town where getting raped was just part of the party experience. You drink, have fun, pass out, and wake up with some random dude if not more. So have no sympathy for the sick fucks. But the one girl I knew who hadn't been raped, had more sex then any girl I've known. But she understood that when you have booze, boys, and girls at a party there is going to be a rapist at that party. We didn't have designated drivers, we had designated babysitters. She didn't drink heavily unless I was there and if I wasn't she didn't drink. Always had full control of her environment and bailed at the slightest sign of trouble. When most rape cases for me where in these party situations, if you aren't passed out drunk he can't carry you away. It sucks you can't party your ass off and live how you want to live but there are ways to limit your exposure to dangerous situations.  You're missing the point - we cannot predict what a "dangerous situation" is.  Not always no. Horrible things can happen at any moment. So we take those steps to protect ourselves, surround ourselves with people we can truely trust, and constantly vigilante. Hope for the best plan for the worst. I think rape has become so common place (at least it feels that way to me sometimes) there are lessons we can take from another's experience.  The example I've seen used in these cases was a little more complex. But ill keep it short. A girl goes to a party, she's wearing revealing clothing, flirting with the boys, even dancing provocatively, and drinking. As the night goes on she becomes intoxicated and increasingly rambunctious.

Victim shaming and abuser shaming are two sides to the same coins. One needs to distinguish between moral responsibility and practical responsibility. Every event, good or bad, has a chain of action leading up to it for which many people are responsible, in the sense that, had they acted differently then that event would not have occurred.

In your example most of the party goers only bear practical responsibility for what happened. The moral responsibility for the crime falls entirely upon the shoulders of the rapists.   I think it is also a way to convince ourselves that if *they* did something to bring some tragedy upon themselves, we can protect *ourselves* from the same fate, by not engaging in whatever action we think they took to deserve such tragedies.  In other words:  we feel safer by identifying the causes of some tragedy because we think we can take steps to prevent the same from happening to us.    I feel like this is an interesting lens to look at all kinds of discrimination and -isms through. I bet a lot of people who don't believe in implicit sexism in US society also believe that the world is pretty fair, and that if they've done well, it was because they were really just better/smarter/more hardworking/more dedicated than everyone who does less well than them.

To preface this: Obviously, victims of crime do not deserve it.  People do not deserve to be victims of anything, whether it be receiving unwanted catcalls as you walk down the street, petty theft, or rape or murder.  I'm also using second-person tense because it's easier, it doesn't apply to the author or anyone specifically.

That being said, people should make the best decisions for their well being, and I think the hypothesis of this article makes a fair point against itself - the world isn't fair, and you shouldn't walk into a bad neighbourhood by yourself.  Being drunk is an excuse, but it isn't going to save you.  If you do get assaulted, it's not your fault just because you walked into a bad neighborhood, it is the fault of the person doing the assaulting, but the decision to go into that neighbourhood is (statistically) bad for your well being.  If you have a history of making decisions such as these under the influence of alcohol, perhaps it is time to consider how much you drink. 

To draw an (often used) analogy, if I leave my car unlocked, it's not my fault if my stereo gets stolen, but there are decisions I could have made to significantly lower the chance of that happening to me. But all these "safeguards" are only seen as needed in hindsight. Nobody lives a totally cautious life all the time. We are vulnerable. Scary isn't it? But all these "safeguards" are only seen as needed in hindsight. Nobody lives a totally cautious life all the time. We are vulnerable. Scary isn't it? Yeah, of course.  To avoid anything negative happening to you, you basically have to stay in your home and not let anyone else inside.  Anything beyond that is putting yourself (and myself) at risk of assault.

I just mean in terms of running the numbers, if it's beneficial to take/not take certain actions, it can be worth it.  I drive my car to work (which is one of the riskiest things I do in everyday life), but I make sure I put my seat belt on, and I turn my lights on.

Not that things like wearing a seatbelt or putting your lights on are directly comparable to something with affects a person's freedom, like how they dress. &amp;gt; Not that things like wearing a seatbelt or putting your lights on are directly comparable to something with affects a person's freedom, like how they dress.

That's true. So why do you keep trying to compare them? They're both methods of risk mitigation (assuming, as ever, that the way a woman would dress affects her chance of being assaulted.  As I have said, I haven't seen any research either way, and I think there would be significant difficulties in achieving such research.  Such an idea should not be outright dismissed because it conflicts with the values you hold, however).

Risk mitigation is about determining what kind of risk is acceptable for the benefits you receive.

As I noted, the safest way to avoid assault is to stay at home and have no interaction with anyone.  That has obvious drawbacks, so the vast majority of people determine the risk of going outside and seeing other people to be worth it.

Then there are middling risks - for instance, you are statistically safer outside during the day than at night.  It's not as safe as staying inside (I'm sure you've heard people describe some crimes with 'during broad daylight!'), but you're safer on average during the day.

Then there are minor risks.  For instance, how a woman dresses.  Assuming it does have an effect (which, like I said, I haven't seen a study), I was saying it may be worth it, as a form of risk mitigation, for some women, in some situations.  I don't know if I need to say this again, but it would be a choice, like a harness when climbing or kneepads when skateboarding (I would use the seat belt example again, but there are laws against not wearing one). &amp;gt;assuming, as ever, that the way a woman would dress affects her chance of being assaulted

It may do. [The evidence suggests that women who dress in a sexually provocative manner are less likely to be raped](http://clubtroppo.com.au/2011/05/17/does-provocative-clothing-protect-women-against-rape/), because such clothing displays confidence, and rapists prefer victims lacking in confidence who are less likely to fight back.

You still don't realize how completely off-topic you are, do you? You're so thoroughly derailed at this point that I don't think you could ever be brought back around to the actual topic. But all these "safeguards" are only seen as needed in hindsight. Nobody lives a totally cautious life all the time. We are vulnerable. Scary isn't it? There are many examples of safeguards that are so common place and socially expected that I don't have to wait until it happens in order to learn my lesson. We use patterns in criminal and victim behavior specifically so we can provide safeguard tips. If I get mugged walking down dark alleys while counting a pile of cash I'd imagine most responses would be "well ya, no shit you were mugged dumbass. "  There is no sexual assault or rape equivalent to "counting a pile of cash." Not a direct comparison, just a different situation to simplify the concept. What concept is that? There are ways to increase and prevent the exposure to dangerous situations. Not a silver bullet or a promise of a wonderful safe life. Some see a vulnerability and attack it so we try and safeguard our vulnerabilities. To preface this: Obviously, victims of crime do not deserve it.  People do not deserve to be victims of anything, whether it be receiving unwanted catcalls as you walk down the street, petty theft, or rape or murder.

To draw an (often used) analogy, if I leave my car unlocked, it's not my fault if my stereo gets stolen, but there are decisions I could have made to significantly lower the chance of that happening to me. You know, one thing that amazes me about this particular thread is how some men have come in here with the assumption that women don't have any idea about risk factors surrounding rape and that you need to come educate us. Do you honestly think we don't know any of this? Do you have any idea how condescending you're being by assuming that we know nothing about what measures are available to protect ourselves against rape?

The truth is that girls and women are taught things that men aren't. We are taught to be hyper aware when we're walking outside at night. We're constantly being shamed about our clothing and being given the message that what we wear (or drink or do or say) could lead us to being raped. We're taught things like how to carry our keys between our fingers so we can stab a guy in the eyes if he approaches us, or to never get in an elevator alone with a strange man. We're being sold self-defense classes and cans of mace and keychain-sized airhorns.

And yet whenever we mention how this message of rape threat is everywhere--it's pervasive and overwhelming--we get guys coming in here and saying that we shouldn't be paranoid because the threat of rape by a stranger in a dark alley is really rare. I have seen so many threads here in 2XC that follow along exactly those lines, and there's no shortage of men telling us to not be paranoid and to stop making men feel like rapists.

But when we fight back and say we're sick of all this burden being placed on us, when we say that it should be okay for us to wear what we want to wear or drink a little too much or go somewhere alone--privileges that men take for granted--then we get told that we're not being properly risk averse and that if something happens to us, it's our fault for trying to enjoy life the same way that men get to do without problem.

So yeah, I'm going to continue to say that it's not right for you to say that women need to not dress provocatively because it means she might get raped (even though evidence doesn't actually support any causation there). And you know what? I'm going to continue to be told by people like you that I'm wrong and people like u/johnbentley that I'm being intellectually dishonest, and both of you are going to continue to go through life thinking that it's perfectly okay to tell women all the ways they don't get to enjoy life the way men do and that they're to blame if they get raped. I know that nothing I do or say will ever change your mind, and it makes me unbelievably sad.  To preface this: Obviously, victims of crime do not deserve it.

This is wholly beside the point. The point is that a known psychological bias exists in humans. We have a tendency to blame the victim, *above and beyond* anything they may have done to put themselves in that situation.

[The wikipedia article Just-World Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) has many many links to scientific research papers on the issue. The existence of this non-rational cognitive bias is not really up for debate by this stage. Oh, yeah, I knew the article was about that.  I sort of just wanted to have a conversation about it, and this seemed as appropriate a place as any.  Usually when I find appropriate threads they're already full of comments of people trolling/shitfighting.  To preface this: Obviously, victims of crime do not deserve it.

Apparently you've missed the fact that even people who do all the right things and behave in the most appropriate ways have bad things happen to them. And people who are terrible, awful people have good things happen to them.

Trying to distill this conversation down to an insulting example about leaving your car unlocked really indicates that you 1) either didn't read or understand the article or any of the related links and 2) you have a high belief in a just world. Simply offering the preface you did does not cancel out the subsequent victim blaming in your comments. I didn't miss that.  It is, of course, no matter how effectively people mitigate risks, impossible (within practical means) to completely stamp out sexual assault (or any other crime that I can think of).  

My argument is about mitigating risks.  I would not go into a bad neighbourhood alone at night, because it would be too risky for me.  That's just a cost/benefits analysis.

I can do everything 'right' (though it's odd to me that you're arguing against the idea that women should have to take any action to prevent themseleves being hurt, and then using an expression like 'doing everything right) and still have my car broken into.  I could do everything right and still get shot during a mugging that happened to me by complete random chance, and not at all affected by any actions I took.  But those are both things that are more likely to happen if I take certain actions, like leaving my car unlocked, or going into a bad neighbourhood alone.

I'm sorry if I upset you - I did not mean to and legitimately want to have a conversation about this.

A second thought to follow on from this (its a more contentious idea, so I wanted it to be separate and I'm definitely open to arguments against it):

If we consider the very specific case where someone is sexually assaulted by someone they've never met as they (for instance) walk down the street^1, if there is a chance that a person is more likely to be assaulted because of what they are wearing, is it worth considering that perhaps they shouldn't wear it if they aren't in a place where they can be safe from this kind of assault?  I would think (as a man, but not one with the kind of psychological damage which leads people to be rapists) that skimpier clothing leads to more thoughts of lust.  If that can, for want of a better word, trigger these people to assault women, then perhaps we want to avoid having women in those situations.  Not because women would be at fault, but because I think (in the short to medium term - I'm talking decades) it will not be possible to significantly affect sexual assault rates (down many orders of magnitude from where they are now).

Ideally, of course, women can wear whatever they like and have no fear of assault.  If something happens to them, it is not their fault (and nothing should happen to them).  But, unfortunately, again, we live in a world where life isn't fair, and you should make decisions which are best for your well being.  I just think people should look after themselves.

^1 I know that the (vast?) majority of sexual assault cases involve someone the victim knows.  These are not the cases which I am writing about.  I also have been told (but haven't seen a citation) that what a woman is wearing has a negligible impact on whether or not they are assaulted, but I think this would be a very difficult thing to prove (you can't exactly have a control group), and may not  Y'know, I'm actually questioning that bit about more revealing clothing being linked to a higher chance of sexual assault. I mean, first, there's a way higher chance for women to get raped/molested in countries where women cover themselves up *way* more than in 'western' places. 
Second, I'd say if a guy is horny/sick enough to go for rape in the first place, a woman could be wearing a burka and he'd be turned on. 
Third, rape is mostly about power. You could be not attractive in any way at all, and it wouldn't save you, because it's not about making love with a beuatiful woman in the first place, but about controlling another human being.    That's fair enough, and I (tried to) assess that in my comment.

But those are all different data points, and they're all reasonable ones, but we can't really do a study (good), so if there's a school of thought that a person would be safer by taking a certain action, perhaps it's worth considering.

But to address your points spefically:

1 - there is a stronger rape culture and ideas of rape normalisation in these countries.  The fact that the women are covered up are one issue, but so is the fact that men can (much more easily) "get away with it" and that it's considered normal.  I'm not denying for a second that rape culture is damaging, because it's obviously terrible and I'm all for taking actions which can help stamp it out.

2 (and 3) - sure, but there's got to be a point where a decision is made.  Rapists don't spend time raping people all the time.  Partially, it's about accessibility - a woman alone on a dark street in a bad neighbourhood, for instance - but if revealing dress also affects that, then (in terms of individual safety), that's a fair argument for avoiding it.  Like I said, I haven't seen a study either way.

Of course, I'm not looking to say that women shouldn't dress how they want.  Of course they can.  You can also make an effort to ensure you are not alone on dark streets.  You shouldn't be paralysed by fear of rape, and it's not fair to suggest that women should live their lives in fear because it is the rapists fault, and not theirs, but putting yourself in an unsafe situation should be avoided where possible (and this applies for all people, but I'm writing about women here as (on average) women are less able to defend themselves and more often the victims of assault, and, from my experience, far more likely to suffer from victim blaming). A second thought to follow on from this (its a more contentious idea, so I wanted it to be separate and I'm definitely open to arguments against it):

Because I do. And I've been walking around my neighborhood in a tiny party dress before and nothings happened, and I've been walking around Alone in sweatpants and been hassled. 

It doesn't matter what you're wearing it matters that there happens to be a creep there, you're a woman and an easy target. That's all. I could be wearing all my clothes at once and as long as I'm by myself (easy target) and someone who is looking for a victim is nearby it won't matter. It's not like a rapist is sitting in the shadows watching women modestly dressed walk by alone and going "no, not that one, her outfit is too covering" no no that one, not hot enough, etc. its an easy target. That's all. Clothing doesn't matter.

 I live in an upper-middle class suburb (and in Australia, where the 'bad' suburbs are still an order of magnitude nicer than some in the US).

And that's fair enough, I know women will still get hassled (and that sucks, and no one deserves it).  I was just suggesting that if it's less likely (as I said, I haven't seen any data either way), then perhaps behavioral changes where possible might be worth it.

I was speaking of specifically opportunistic crimes where a rapist has a lustful feeling upon seeing someone alone.  I don't know if the way a person would be dressed would affect that (but my thoughts are more lustful of someone in a party dress compared to sweat pants, for instance). No, that's not actually how it works. Most rape happens to people that know each other already (like date rape or something) 

And on the off chance a random rapist is out there it's not because he sees the most beautiful woman dressed in a small dress and then has an overwhelming need to rape. It's because there's an easy target and it's a woman. Wearing pants and walking down the street as opposed to wearing a dress walking down the street in the exact same situation isn't going to make a difference if there's a rapist looking for a victim.

And what are you supposed to do? Sure it's easy to say "don't walk at night" but seriously? I have to stay in my house after dark? I can't afford a taxi to take me places (remember my shitty neighborhood? I don't live there because I'm rich, I live there because it's all I can afford). I'm not going to drunk drive.

So I do what I can to stay safe, I try to stay out, I have mace in my pocket but sometimes I end up walking home alone. And it's not my fault at all ever even a little bit if some crazy piece of shit comes at me to do something horrible, whether I'm wearing a snowsuit or a party dress. No, that's not actually how it works. Most rape happens to people that know each other already (like date rape or something)

The harm done by having women wear something they don't currently want to wear would be bigger than the benefit of fewer assaults.

(I don't think what I'm saying is especially correct, but it shows that just because an individual woman can reduce her risk of assault by dressing differently doesn't mean that women in general should be encouraged to do so.) That's a fair enough argument.  I don't for a second think that I'm in a position to tell other people how they should dress or how they should behave, but, like all actions I take, I apply a risk analysis to them to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks.

Unfortunately I don't have the statistics to be able to determine whether the risks would outweigh the benefits (and the analysis is going to be different for every person and their idea of acceptable risk).  

As an aside, I'm pretty uncomfortable with ideas like 'acceptable risk' for someone being raped, but I guess that's sort of what it comes down to. A second thought to follow on from this (its a more contentious idea, so I wanted it to be separate and I'm definitely open to arguments against it):

Your solution is to punish women and shame them for what they're wearing and what their bodies look like instead of putting the blame on the people who commit crimes. You're victim blaming, pure and simple, and you're doing it while trying to make an argument that rapists (males in particular, judging by your examples) can't control themselves nor should they be expected to. No, I'm really really not.  I can't tell if I'm not being clear and you're misreading me, or you're making assumptions based upon what other people have said about this in the past.

Like many social problems, there is no 'solution'.  Even if I made a worldwide decree tomorrow that all women should be completely covered, women would still get raped.  I do not want to punish women, I do not want to shame them.  Women, and men, can wear whatever they want and I have no problem with that, nor would I consider myself to be in a position to do anything about it if I did.

Men should obviously be able to control themselves and the expectation should be that they do so.  However, some will not be able to.  We should not make excuses for these people, we should not enable them in any way.  But if there are actions other people can take to avoid being hurt by the people who cannot control themselves, maybe they're worth considering, if we can show that it will have a significant effect.  I don't know if the way women dress does, but I am sure that being alone at night in a bad neighbourhood will significantly affect how at risk a person is. No, I'm really really not.

I've read every comment in this thread along all branches by yourself and 6040.

6040 has been thoroughly intellectually dishonest principally by misrepresenting your position and spitting on that misrepresentation. But most egregiously by a false charge of irrelevancy (a false charge of "derailing") - a classic way to avoid addressing an argument.

Unfortunately this is a frequent occurrence on reddit. What is disturbing is that people get upvoted for this intellectual dishonesty while others, such as yourself, who present discussion contributing, intellectually exposed, and relevant points, are downvoted.

To your content. While this is not quite a representation of the kind of thesis you have been advancing perhaps  the following three points accord with the spirit of your thesis.

Firstly, even if someone is causally responsible for an outcome it doesn't follow they are morally responsible for it.

Secondly, to be causally responsible does not entail that you are a contributor of the sole or even major cause. Events are always the result of multiple causes. Culturally we are in the habit of identifying "the cause" as that which is most significant. This way of speaking can make us blind to contributing minor causes.

Thirdly, while the just-world fallacy might account for some victim blaming another cause of victim blaming might arise out of a failure to distinguish between causal and moral responsibility.

What do you reckon? I also noticed dukeofwhales had a very objective perspective on an issue that is, obviously, a very emotional one. I think this perspective (I'm not saying it's wrong at all by the way) combined with the fact that he(?) was speaking about situations that are (estimated to be) less common with rape (being raped by a stranger) ignited some defensiveness. This objectiveness may have come across as cold or ignorant, particularly because everything was through text. I know it wasn't the intent, but that may be part of the communication barrier we've observed here.

I've read through the thread twice now. I can appreciate wanting to have a discussion about opposing viewpoints and I think it's a bit unfair that this person got downvoted for some points that were not intended to be offensive and presented in a pretty fair way. I did also appreciate having the opportunity to read about the opposing viewpoints and am not discouraging that all--I think it's a good thing. 

I do disagree, though, that many measures could be taken to prevent sexual assault. You can carry mace, you can go to a self-defense class, you can impose a curfew on your nights--but that does not mean it is unavoidable. 

I am also not sure that taking the measures of wearing less revealing clothing or not going out on your own *is* a valid suggestion to avoid these risks because that is a sacrifice of independence that I don't think is fair. As such, these reasons really are not good reasons to include in what is a *reasonable* measure to take when avoiding risk.

I know he wasn't arguing that it would be unavoidable, what I'm saying is that I don't think this proposal of risk assessment is as much of a panacea for this issue as he suggests. I think this because it goes beyond taking the proper measures for protection, it goes beyong that notion that life isn't fair. I think there are larger factors at work that foster the ability for someone to commit sexual assault, such as sexism and conservative ideas on sexual behaviors. 

With that said, this discussion highlights how there are a lot of grey areas with issues such as these, because everyone's circumstances and life experiences are different. In order to stay truly objective, I think being reminded of this is important and that discussions can help facilitate that, so I'm glad that everyone shared their thoughts. 

EDIT: I apparently did not click edit the first time. To whoever gave me reddit gold, thank you! :) Thanks for your comment. As I went through this thread, making an effort to reply to everyone who took the time to reply to me, I am becoming less sure of the idea, especially after [Captain_Airstrip_One's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18pw22/ever_wonder_why_victimblaming_is_so_common_the/c8h58fh?context=3).  And that's fair enough, it is an extreme (and, a lot of the time, it doesn't make any sense - you'd expect to be safe around a group of friends, and you can't always anticipate being separated from them - you can't exactly make a call like 'well I might be alone later so better make sure my skirt is n inches long').

Being by yourself at night is something that I think men can relate to better than it's been given credit for in this thread.  I avoid it wherever possible, and am (probably unnecessarily) on edge when it does happen to me, especially in areas I don't know.  The risk of something happening to me is certainly lower, but if we include muggings (and worse), we're probably talking within the same order of magnitude.

My issue specifically with the article was the idea that a woman has too many drinks, goes in the wrong direction and ends up in the wrong place.  I know it's a hypothetical, but I cannot comprehend how that would happen to someone - did she have a plan to get home? Was she with friends?  Why not call a cab?  If she can't afford one, why was she out drinking at a bar she couldn't get home from easily?  If drinking too much frequently causes this to happen, then that's a concern because drinking is then putting the person at risk - and that for me would be a problem.  As I said, everyone has different levels of acceptable risk, and sometimes it can be difficult to judge how much risk you're actually putting yourself in.

What do you reckon?</snippet></document><document><title>I got a call from my doctor this morning telling me my pap smear results came back abnormal. Please please please calm my mind here Reddit.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18rhqa/i_got_a_call_from_my_doctor_this_morning_telling/</url><snippet>Hey you guys, it's been a ridiculous day. I'm a 21 year old female. I was getting ready for class today when my doctor called telling my pap smear results from last week came back abnormal. They told me it may be HPV.

Some background: In September 2012, I was very sore down in the vaginal area and went to my OB/GYN. She did a pap smear and I tested positive for a severe yeast infection. She told me she was running other tests (for HPV and other STDs) and she would only call me if something came back positive. I thankfully never received the phone call.

In October 2012, I started dating and becoming sexually active with my current boyfriend. Since then, I've felt healthy and sex has been great. However, I noticed extra discharge in my underwear, so I called my OB/GYN. She told me it was most likely my birth control but that I should still come in for a pap smear. So now, February 2013, I went in. I had a pap smear last week. I tested negative for any infections.

Now I got the call this morning that I may have HPV. They told me they need to run more tests and have me come in a week. I've already cried this morning. I can't eat or focus. I'm freaking out. My doctor tried to ease my mind and tell me that if this is HPV, it will likely go away on its own. I'm confused and I'm scared. What do I do? What does this mean?

Also, does this mean my boyfriend most likely gave it to me? How do I tell him? He'll notice if and when I have to decline any sexual advances because of HPV treatment and procedures. I still want him to like me and find me sexy. How the hell do I tell him? When do I tell him?

Please help Reddit. Please. I am so scared!  Calm down. This is incredibly incredibly common. 

There's a very good chance he gave it to you, but if you've ever had sex with anyone else even with condoms, you very well could have gotten it from them. It's typically asymptomatic and impossible to diagnose in men unless they have genital warts.

And it will almost definitely go away on its own because you're young and healthy, so it's not just going to give you cancer or something. There's not really a treatment for it, and all it means is that you have to monitor your cervix for evidence of pre-cancerous cells because your risk is a little bit elevated now. 

It's best to tell your boyfriend so that he knows (slightly increased risk of penile cancers and oral cancers if you get it orally) and so that if you guys break up, he can make sure to inform anyone else he has sex with so that they can make informed decisions. It's not a big deal at all, and it's not either of your faults. But it is something you should communicate to him, though if you want you can wait until you've spoken with your doctor again and understand it completely. This; plus also they can get abnormal results for lots of reasons.  I used to get them every couple years, and followup testing would never show anything.  Eventually figured out that having sex within 24 hours of my smear could mess up the results (I'd either never been told not to have it the same day, or had been told before I started having sex so I completely  ignored and then forgot about it.  I was 40 before I found out you weren't supposed to and that it could have been the reason for my abnormal cells.  Sigh.).  And even if it is, a) most variants don't cause cancer, b) the ones that do are usually eminently treatable if caught early enough, which this would be, and c) I didn't know this until recently as well, but HPV isn't like HSV - it can clear up on its own and go away entirely.  It's not a life sentence.   [deleted] Yes, but 'abnormal cells' aren't necessarily HPV+ markers.  They could be blood cells, or a number of other factors, which might signal a different HPV infection than the ones specifically tested for.  And which might not be as dangerous. I just got the call this morning! And good news! I tested negative for any high risk strains of HPV. They told me my body will clear this on its own as long as I stay healthy. Calm down. This is incredibly incredibly common.

I called my two closest female friends and asked their advice. BOTH have tested positive for HPV in the past. One of them told me her long-term boyfriend gave it to her. She told me she has to get pap smears more often now, but she has had no symptoms or complications. This was incredibly comforting to hear.

As for my boyfriend, if he, and most likely it appears, gave it to me, I don't blame him one bit. There was no way he could have known. It's still a difficult conversation starting " so you may have given me a STD." Calm down. This is incredibly incredibly common.

It's best to tell your boyfriend so that he knows (slightly increased risk of penile cancers and oral cancers if you get it orally) and so that if you guys break up, he can make sure to inform anyone else he has sex with so that they can make informed decisions. It's not a big deal at all, and it's not either of your faults. But it is something you should communicate to him, though if you want you can wait until you've spoken with your doctor again and understand it completely. Okay. I need to ask a little more. I can't fully calm my mind. Back in September when I was having pain in my vagina, I went through a month or so of not being able to eat a lot and bleeding in between periods. Since then, my appetite has fully returned and now there is only very slight bleeding occasionally. I look up the symptoms of cervical cancer, and I'm freaking out. Please tell me cancer is unlikely. I want to have children some day.   I was in pretty much the exact same situation and I had the exact same reaction. Basically they're going to do another exam, see what's going on down there and tell you what to do. If you just have some white cells, there's nothing they can do. It'll clear up on its own within a year or a two. I went ahead and finished the Guardasil vaccination and at my most recent visit, I was told that everything was fine. 

If you do happen to have precancerous cells, the cancer won't show up for years. They'll do another procedure where they freeze/burn/get rid (i'm not sure) of any white spots that may be on your cervix and that should stop the abnormal cells from continuing. 

Relax, for sure. HPV is so incredibly common. There's two strains that cause genital warts and two strains that are precancerous. The odds of you having one of those specific four strains is slim, so there's no need to worry. Just wait until you see the doctor. I was FREAKING out when I heard but not even six months later and I'm totally fine. Don't worry! You will be fine. You just have to deal with it. Your doctor will advise you through the process.

 Tell your boyfriend. You probably got it from him so he shouldn't get mad. Even if you didn't get it from him, there are no signs or symptoms in males so nothing would change for him, really. He just needs to be careful with future sex partners. [deleted]     Just a side note, if you find out that you do have HPV after you colposcopy and have had sex with other partners outside of your boyfriend in the time in between your pap smears please let them know that you have HPV and that they might also have it. As a another poster mentioned, there is no test for HPV in men and it can spread to other girls. 


I just got diagnosed this past semester and it was crushing to me, I am in my late 20s and waited until my first boyfriend this year to become sexually active. He has had several partners and they did not let him know that they were positive, so he spread it to me. My Doctor said that it will pass within 2-3 years and that if you take Vitamin B it will help bust your immunity to help you recover faster. 

 [deleted] Where are you getting this information from?
&amp;gt;You can have HPV for a decade and get a clean pap every year, but then suddenly have an abnormal growth 10 years later.

From what I read after my diagnosis, there is little known about the acquisition to abnormal pap time frame but it seem to be short via studies using correlation (Rositch AF et al., 2012; Gravitt PE, 2011). On Wiki there is a section on latency of HPV but the article they cite there is not about the infection, thought they claim it to be. It is about the detection of cancer, which can be 15 to 20 years after infections.

Finally, I think that is super irresponsible of you to tell people who have an active sexually transmitted infection to not notify their past sexual partners when they test positive. Shame on you! Why is it irresponsible? It's not an STD like chlamydia where not telling someone will increase the risk of them spreading to to other people. 

Transmission of HPV cannot be prevented by any birth control measures. It also can't be tested for in males. Therefore if she tells someone hat she has HPV and that they may have it, what practical difference is it going to make? He can't get tested, so he'll only know that be might have it. Then of he tells his future girlfriends he might have it, the only way he can make sure not to give it to them is to not ever sleep with them or have any genital contact. For a virus that basically most of the population have at some point, and don't even know they have. 

It's all very well to talk about being responsible but what the hell practical difference will it make?  </snippet></document><document><title>Very inspirational blog for women by a very special woman</title><url>http://chloepsommers.blogspot.com/</url><snippet> </snippet></document><document><title>I came out of the Quiver Full community. It is disheartening to think my old friends will never progress past this.</title><url>http://www.aboverubies.org/index.php/articles/english-language/family-planning/312-family-planning-101-reasons-for-having-children</url><snippet>  The author just seems to be repeating herself constantly. She makes maybe twenty main points for having kids and just rephrases each point five different ways.  Summary:

* Children are gifts from god.
* I like being pregnant.
* If I have more babies I have more slaves to do my bidding.
* Each son I have increases the probability that I will be the mother of the second coming of Jesus.
* I like citing random passages from scripture and inventing vague interpretations that support having more babies.
* If I'm pregnant I don't have to worry about having periods.

Yeah, it's pretty much all of those over and over again.

I'm also inclined to add this to the list "I am a man and can only sort of imagine what this is like for my wife, but, eh, it's her problem", but of course it's ghostwritten. Each son I have increases the... what? That sounds a lot like reincarnation to me. I thought Quiverfull was more the premillennialist style. From the article, and interpreted very literally:

&amp;gt; We want to raise another soul for Jesus. I think that reason is in reference to creating an army for Jesus. Many people in the conservative Christian community are freaked out by our changing culture. They worry that all the believers will disappear. By having lots of children and raising them with Christ, they are "taking back" America.  The author just seems to be repeating herself constantly. She makes maybe twenty main points for having kids and just rephrases each point five different ways.   I was going to say the same thing. "I love being "with child"'', "I love being pregnant", etc. She just repeats her 'points'. 

Please forgive my ignorance. I'm unfamiliar with the Quiver Full community. So far as I can tell, it's just another uber-conservative Christian sect trying to reduce women to the role of broodmares and helpmeets. Basically, they take "be fruitful and multiply" WAYYYY to seriously... ^ this. They take the view that it is God's will that women have as many children as possible and raise them to be "good Christians" who also have as many children as possible. It's a bizarre interpretation of Scripture, and an arch-conservative one. Bizarre? Not really. Conservative? Yes. It's a culture which sees children as blessings from God, and some women really get into that; they feel that it fulfills them in many ways. As the list shows, with several repetitions ... but if a woman wants to spend her life raising children, so be it. Who am I to judge? I judge.  I think that the children, more often than not, pay the price for the parents' decisions.  They have to raise their siblings because there are too many kids and not enough adults. I also judge, because the Earth has to pay the price, too. I know this is an incredibly unpopular opinion but...we should not feel entitled to have as many children as possible! Our population is too great as is. Earth has a finite amount of resources, and there is a carrying capacity for every species on Earth...including humans.  I judge.  I think that the children, more often than not, pay the price for the parents' decisions.  They have to raise their siblings because there are too many kids and not enough adults. Bizarre? Not really. Conservative? Yes. It's a culture which sees children as blessings from God, and some women really get into that; they feel that it fulfills them in many ways. As the list shows, with several repetitions ... but if a woman wants to spend her life raising children, so be it. Who am I to judge? I'm with you there, as long as that's what she *really* want's that's fine. But cutting off contact with the rest of the culture at large raises huge red flags for me, as does the martial nature of their discussion.  

I often see "raising a population of Christians to inherit the earth" as a motivation, which is all fine and good, but then they start talking about "weapons" and "defending" against an "enemy." Hearing that, I get this sinking suspicion that my female-head-of-household, secular ways are something they find threatening. Some blogs read like a natalist, Christian jihad. Well, they *may* see your way of life as threatening. They may feel that society at large would be much better if everyone was more like them and less like you. Think of all the problems that would be solved if everyone really wanted kids and lived their lives around having kids and caring for them and raising them to be what you believe that they should be ... 

But then, perhaps you feel that society would be better if everyone was more like *you*. 

The weapons they're talking about are spiritual, as is the enemy. I don't think you're the target, nor is your lifestyle. Unless they're out there being assholes to you because you are a secular, childfree person (and yes, there are obviously those types of fundamentalists out there)... but I don't read this article as portraying that attitude. They're living their beliefs and as long as nobody is forcing harmful, poisonous beliefs onto someone else, it's all well and good.  How do we define forcing? Cutting their children off from contact with the outside world and teaching them that these secular people are sinful, their way of life is against God, and thus they are hellbound?

I am all for freedom to raise your children the way you see fit (so long as you're not abusing them in any way) but they're toeing that brainwashing line at the *very* least.

Oh, and for some reason I feel the need to add that I *love* children, and want to have them someday, so I don't really qualify for the "childfree" moniker. If such a family told their children that people who didn't follow their religion were, as you said, sinful and hell-bound, well, that's just like, their opinion, man. Which they are entitled to. There are plenty of religious groups that think that people outside of their group are damned in some way. Pretty much Islam, Christianity ... that's what, 3 billion people? Hard to escape from it. But does it affect you if someone else is of the opinion that you're going to hell? Unless they're discriminating against you or treating you badly because of it, IMO it really doesn't. 

So if you raise your child to think like you, to follow your religion and culture, is that a crime? in the US, we are free to raise our children however we like. You're going to raise your children to think like you as well because even as you encourage them to think for themselves, which is healthy, you will instill certain values and mores in them, and they may be influenced by your life choices just like the children of this couple will be. 

Brainwashing ... I'd def label the WBC, for instance, as brainwashers in the extreme. Or cults. But this article paints the author as very innocent and not really pressuring towards other people to have 34 kids as well. Just describing why she really likes being pregnant. That's just it, my children will have a choice, while they don't seem to. Any other choice is full of hellfire and damnation. I was going to say the same thing. "I love being "with child"'', "I love being pregnant", etc. She just repeats her 'points'. 

Please forgive my ignorance. I'm unfamiliar with the Quiver Full community. So far as I can tell, it's just another uber-conservative Christian sect trying to reduce women to the role of broodmares and helpmeets. 'Loving being pregnant' seems like a terrible reason to have a baby.  It's not the reason I'd choose, but if she's a good mum, I don't feel I get to judge her reasons. I rail and fight against people judging someone's abortion or choice to give up their baby for adoption. Why should people who want to have kids be treated any less respectfully? Again, provided the kids are well cared-for. Because having a kid because you like being pregnant is like getting a dog because you love puppies. Eventually the puppy grows up and the kid is born and that part of the motivation is gone too. 

People should have kids because they enjoy *raising* (their) children. It's not the reason I'd choose, but if she's a good mum, I don't feel I get to judge her reasons.

Please forgive my ignorance. I'm unfamiliar with the Quiver Full community. So far as I can tell, it's just another uber-conservative Christian sect trying to reduce women to the role of broodmares and helpmeets. They believe that married couples shouldn't use birth control and should actively try to conceive as many children as possible.  Think the Duggars.  The Duggars (and many other Quiverful families) wean the babies early so the mom is fertile again. I saw an interview with Michelle Duggar where she said pregnancy never affected her ability to nurse and nursing didn't suppress ovulation for her. I don't think it's true that she weaned her kids early in order to get pregnant again, although I'm sure some women do. No offense, but I don't know if I necessarily believe her. She might be perfectly honest, or she could be lying or mistaken. Did she give an exact date as to when she was weaning the babies? It's possible she's just very fertile, but most women have trouble getting pregnant for at least the first six months of nursing.   Granted, I have no firsthand knowledge of the Quiver Full movement aside from the Duggars and similar families I've read about/seen on TV, but I've always thought it was ironic how the lion's share of work always seems to fall on the oldest children, particularly daughters.  It makes me really sad for them because it seems like they don't really get a chance to explore who they are and what they're about between raising their little siblings and getting married young to continue the cycle.

I've always wanted to learn more about the Quiverfull movement, especially as it applies to women. Have you ever considered doing an AMA? There are lots of good blogs written by women who left the Quiverfull movement.  If you want, I can round up some links for you. I'm not the person you responded to but I'd love to read the links I'm not the person you responded to but I'd love to read the links I've always wanted to learn more about the Quiverfull movement, especially as it applies to women.

It's really helped me in my journey out of religion and to realize I wasn't alone.

  "It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

Well, I'm sold! Cooking part, true. Cleaning up part, not so much. That's where having ten kids comes in handy. Put 'em to work, just like in the ole homesteadin' days! That's where having ten kids comes in handy. Put 'em to work, just like in the ole homesteadin' days! "It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

Well, I'm sold! "It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

Well, I'm sold! If none of them have allergies. Or just plain won't eat the food and are too young to understand the concept of 'you eat what's on your plate'. Or if none of them are sick and require special, non-tummy upsetting food. And none of your teenagers has suddenly decided to become vegetarian. And none of your kids is old enough to have started having eating disorder issues. And all of them are home at the same time or are old enough to re-heat their dinner by themselves. And your kids happen to not enjoy food fights, then yes.  &amp;gt;Or just plain won't eat the food and are too young to understand the concept of 'you eat what's on your plate'.

Children in families of 10+ kids don't have the luxury of being picky. They DO understand the concept of you eat what's on your plate from day one. Speaking from experience? I'm honestly curious, because I've seen the opposite so many times... Not my personal experience but other people's, as they've told it to me. I'm amazed that you've seen the opposite! A child in a family of 10 can turn down a type of food and be given a different type? Amazing. "It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

Well, I'm sold! it's probably easier...actually. 

Cooking for one is a bitch, IMO.  Cooking for ten might be easier than cooking for one. Well... easier per person but not in total. Sort of like how if you buy some food in bulk it'll be cheaper per item but still more overall.  I was actually just refering to the cooking part.  not the purchasing of said ingredients. "It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

Well, I'm sold! &amp;gt;"It's just as easy to cook for ten as it is for one!"

I have a hard time doubling a recipe from serving 2 to 4. I am not sold.  A few of these are legitimate reasons for having a child. If you really love being pregnant and raising children makes you happy and fulfilled, that is wonderful. However, most of the reasons are for others- a husband, God, older children, a church's congregation. According to this lady, most of the reasons for having a baby are external pressures. She has just been led to believe that women should put themselves last and be long-suffering saints taking everyone else's crap. 

I come from a similarly baby-centric religion, where women rationalize and defend misogyny in the worst ways. Congratulations on breaking free! It feels good, doesn't it? &amp;gt; According to this lady

I'm genuinely unconvinced the author is actually a woman. There's no byline, and there's at least half a dozen books with that title, most of which were written by men. Wow, I definitely just assumed and didn't even look into that! I had not even considered that it was written by a man. I've heard so many women say those things that I immediately pictured a woman as the author.   Good for you for your journey. As a childfree woman in my mid-30's, I assure you there is way more to life than being someone's mother.  I know a catholic woman in the community. She had 4 when I moved here 5 years ago, and she is on number 7 now. She looks tired.  As someone who came from a semi-diverse community that nonetheless had lots of nominal Catholics, I always find it weird whenever I hear of a Catholic woman actually not using birth control. 

All of my Catholic friends' families only ever had like 2 or 3 kids. The only family I know who had more than that was some kind of weird Protestant something or other.  My mom is really into this stuff, and has been to some conferences. 

Ironically, we just had a heated discussion about this yesterday. I am honestly struggling with faith and religion right now, but even when I was devout, I did not think that any of this was based on very much in terms of scripture and theology. They take a few verses in the Old and New Testament and determine that there are patterns of things like fathers having some kind of umbrella of protection over their daughters, birth control or family planning being against God's commands, etc, etc. 

Yesterday my mom decided to tell me she thinks I need to come back home and live under my father's "wing of protection." I am 25, have lived away from home since I was 17, am in school and have two jobs. I have no debt other than small, current school loans. I think I'm doing ok. 

I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't subscribe to this view but doesn't see the harm in it for my mom. He would love for me to come home, but that is more of a control issue than a "scripture-based" one. This has been a relatively recent philosophical change for my mom (~last ten years) so I wasn't raised believing any of this. I'm tired of being made to feel like I'm somehow failing God because I have a boyfriend and live away from home, and have no kids. 

Sorry this turned into kind of a rambling story, but I've been dealing with this a lot lately and can identify with you, OP.  My mom is really into this stuff, and has been to some conferences.

O_o &amp;gt;It's an honor for the Lord to use my womb again.

O_o I wonder how much she knows about the biology of reproduction . . . it's not the Lord in her womb when that babby starts forming.  Nursing lowers your chance of breast cancer?  I believe the fewer periods you have in your life, the lower the amounts of certain hormones in your body. And lower levels of these hormones may contribute to lower probabilities of developing breast cancer. And nursing holds off your periods.

That's my understanding, although I'm sure some intelligent 2Xer will be able to correct/expand on what I've said.  *Maybe* prevents breast cancer. Try telling it to the mothers who have had breast cancer.  Exactly. Which makes it a super weak argument for having kids.  I believe the fewer periods you have in your life, the lower the amounts of certain hormones in your body.

I'm a child of divorce, so articles like these really frighten me, because if the custody battle had gone differently, this may have been the life I was raised in. 

It was incredibly difficult for me, during visitation, to look at the differences between how my blood-sister and I were raised, and how my step-siblings were raised. I once heard my step-mother tell her daughter that she didn't have to study and get into college, because if she was a good Christian woman God would give her a husband to provide for her.

You remind me a lot of that same step-sister, just from the title of this. She's grown up into a smart and strong young woman, despite my parents' attempts to shape her into someone pliable and accommodating. 

OP, what do you think it was that caused you to come out of the community? What makes people like you and my step-sister different from the many women who take on their perceived God-given duties?  Honestly? It was a history of sexual abuse. I was repeatedly assaulted by an extended family member for years, and I bore the burden of it as a child. Never spoke of it to family, though now I'm certain they knew what happened. Little me bore that secret like it made me a martyr. Long suffering, self-depricating, meek. I thought it would help me serve God in the purpose He had for me, and that's why I went through so much harm.  
Then, I met someone, we'll call her Amy. Amy was like my little sister. She was silly, affectionate, and wonderful. Then something changed. I didn't know what, but I didn't say anything. Then a few months later, her father shot himself in their front yard. He had been sexually abusing her and she finally told him she was going to tell everyone.  
There it was. I felt so certain that this was the reason I'd hurt and suffered so much. To show God's love and plan to this girl.  
 And I tried.  
 And I realized I was just another scared kid. I didn't know anything. I wasn't okay. I couldn't help. She was kicked out of her house and shunned by her family, sent away to a home. There was no purpose or plan. I had been through something horrific alone, and I was still alone. It made me see life for real. Ugly, stark, and pitiless. And so I studied and thought and prayed for something to save my failing faith, and nothing came. And so I left behind what no longer served me.

How do I process this?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qlxb/2xc_im_homesick_in_india_and_was_just_groped_how/</url><snippet>I feel like this community is filled with the best people to talk to about this.

I've been traveling solo in India for just over a month. I'm a woman in my mid-20s. Lately, I've just been really missing my family and friends. Every time I have a good experience here in India (like an excellent hike), it inspires me to do something similar back at home (like go hiking there). I feel like I should be building my life there, rather than being transient here.

It can be quite difficult to encounter people with whom the language barrier is minimal. I feel really lonely.

To top it all off, yesterday, some kid (maybe 15 years old) on a bicycle grabbed my breast yesterday. I went to my guesthouse room and cried, and cried.

I don't even have something solid to go back home to. I don't want to continue going to university and working on my BA. I don't know what kind of a job I should look for, and only have vague ideas. I do have a place to live, but it isn't ideal. I want to start building a life for myself.

If I go home right now, I'll forever feel like I've failed. I also have the option of simply changing regions in this country and hoping that things will be different, or returning to a country that I've previously enjoyed traveling in, or I could try to get more involved with something here (like a week-long meditation retreat).

I suppose I don't really have any specific questions or anything, but I am just reaching out to this community in hope that someone can relate and offer some words of wisdom.

Thanks for your time.  Oh boy, does this hit home for me.

Being sexually harassed is difficult enough.  Traveling to a foreign country is difficult enough.  Being sexually harassed while in a completely foreign and faraway place?  That's fucking awful. The fact that you feel homesick and lost right now is completely understandable.  You've been through a lot.  If you choose to go home, there is nothing to be ashamed of.  You've already shown that you are an incredibly strong person just by choosing to make this trip in the first place.  Yes, you may feel weak now, but if your experience is anything like mine, you will look back on it and realize just how fucking strong you are.

I also spent a month in India.  It was an invigorating, inspiring trip just as you described, until I was sexually harassed one night in my room while staying at a guesthouse with faulty locks on the doors.  I reacted by spending the rest of my time in that city (a couple of days) hiding in my guestroom with the door blockaded, while getting physically sick.

For days, I was feeling lonely, diminished, and weak.  I wanted nothing more than to be home, and if I had the funds, I probably would have done so.  What first started to turn my thinking around was speaking to an Indian friend about it.  She told me, "Just remember that he has taken nothing from you.  He is the one at fault, he is the one whose dignity is now lost.  You are the brave one who has traveled to this rough, foreign country.  He tried to take advantage of that, and in the process, has revealed himself as a coward."

So, OP, I hope that you begin to feel better soon.  You're a strong woman, and whatever you decide to do from here, I'm rooting for you.  I've lived in India. It's a wonderful magical amazing place full of kind, caring people. It's also a dirty disturbing horrible place full of assholes who try to grope, rob, and hurt you. It's kind of like anywhere else in that way, except if you're not Indian, you're probably standing out (perhaps for the first time in your life) in a way that puts a spotlight on you: all the really nice people notice you, but so do the assholes.

Practice saying this: Aaap (like Ah + p) kee maw or bay-hen nuh-hee hey? (Don't you have a mom or sister?)  (That is a terrible phonetic rendering but it'll get you to something recognizable.) Now practice saying it angrily, as an accusation. Practice saying it LOUD, so others hear. Ask an Indian to help you with the sentence; chances are they'll be delighted to help. Saying it when you're being stared at, followed, groped, catcalled, will help you feel less powerless and it will often work to shame your harassers.

Moving on. If you don't want to leave India, then go somewhere in India that's easier. Feeling lonely and lost (not literally -- metaphorically) is a thousand times harder in a country where no one knows you and you don't feel at home. Where are you right now? Let's get you to the easiest place to be you in India: go to Delhi and book a bus ticket to Dharamsala. Once in Dharamsala, go a half hour up the road to McLeod Ganj, where the Dalai Lama lives. It'll be a little snowy right now, but it's a calm, gorgeous place in the foothills of the Himalayas where you're far less likely to be casually harassed on a daily basis. You'll also get to sit at a cafe, clutching a mug of delicious Tibetan noodle soup, and watch Buddhist monks walk by, giggling, constantly giggling, despite the hospital down the road that has a torture rehabilitation unit designed especially for them. Finally, you'll also run into foreigners, many from your country (whichever that might be), who will give you a sense of familiarity that might be comforting right now. That, and the stray dogs are generally much healthier and more often cared for, so you'll also feel safer stopping for a stray cuddle and pet session.

As for your sense of not knowing what to do if you go home -- while you're in Dharamsala (or in Full Circle at Khan Market in Delhi, what a wonderful bookstore!), buy a blank book and write down how you want your life to look in FIVE years, and then TEN. Not tomorrow, not next year, but in these distant futures. Free write. Don't criticize or judge yourself! Just write, and see what comes out.

Then go down into Dharamsala and see a movie at the theater. So what if it's Hindi and you don't understand a word? Just sit there and watch the colors. 

That night, over momos and tea, look again at your journal. These goals you've set, wild though they be, are all in your power to achieve. Now you know where you want to head, you have *a lot of time* to figure out how to get there. Start strategizing small things you could do, back at home, to lay the groundwork to becoming the kind of person you want to be. And by the way, if some of those goals are intangible? Like, "be happy"? Those are changes you can start making *at this very moment*. Look around for a meditation class (they're everywhere in McLeod Gang). Or simply stay up to marvel at the sun rising over the Kangra Valley, and focus on how, at THIS moment, you are, however briefly, the happy person you wanted to be.

Learn not to be so harsh to yourself. Every second you're breathing is a second in which there's more *right* with you than there is wrong.

You're obviously a pretty interesting woman. You're traveling alone through a country a lot of people will never have the courage to visit, because they believe all sorts of silly nonsense that you're already smart enough to have seen through. You've failed at nothing! Be patient with yourself. Be kind to yourself! And dream big, but also take heart in the fact that it's the small steps, every day, every hour, that eventually get you to that distant, amazing goal. I've lived in India. It's a wonderful magical amazing place full of kind, caring people. It's also a dirty disturbing horrible place full of assholes who try to grope, rob, and hurt you. It's kind of like anywhere else in that way, except if you're not Indian, you're probably standing out (perhaps for the first time in your life) in a way that puts a spotlight on you: all the really nice people notice you, but so do the assholes.

And dream big, but also take heart in the fact that it's the small steps, every day, every hour, that eventually get you to that distant, amazing goal.  You sound like you're going through culture shock. A month in is right about that time. Between my 2nd-4th weeks in India, I must have cried every single day. Having some pervy schoolboy grope you was the straw that broke the camel's back, it seems.

I wish I could tell you that this was just a one-off thing but unfortunately street harassment is not an uncommon occurrence. You can handle it any way you want. Don't let anyone tell you that you didn't handle it right. He's the creep; it isn't your fault. (And it's amazing how these ever-so-bold despos will become cowards the moment you tell them you're dragging them by the ear to the police station.) 

Oh and by the way, you ARE building a life for yourself, right now, with the experiences you are having. But if you don't want to stay in India, if you're just not feeling it or there's another place you want to go, then by all means go. You won't have failed in anything. A lot of people see India as this "proving ground" of sorts but it doesn't have to be. I came, stayed about a year and a half, then decided I'd rather be with my boyfriend in southern Louisiana so I left. I didn't win or lose anything; I just changed my address. You will be fine! And if you have any specific questions about living in India, feel free to PM me.
  Ah geez, I'm sorry for what you're going through. I was in India for three weeks last year as part of a study abroad program. Where exactly are you?

My experiences were pretty poor. It was my first real exposure to a non-Western, non-white environment. I had my first exposure to extreme poverty and I got sick a few times (heat exhaustion at the Taj Mahal, some stomach bug in Varanasi). Plus, the other students I were traveling with were very... not like me, to put it delicately. I was the only feminist for one, and one of the only religion majors (which is what the study abroad was about) and it was a very lonely and alienating three weeks.)  I agree with you; you can't really build anything lasting when you are just passing through.

It sounds like you've experienced all you want abroad.  Why not go home?  Wait tables somewhere and take it easy for a while.  As long as you're making enough for rent + bills, you can do whatever you like and no one can give you shit.

Also, just because you are not pursuing a degree or career path doesn't mean you are incapable of looking deeper into the world.  If you are disenchanted with life at home then perhaps try living it differently.</snippet></document><document><title>Does anyone else's period do this to them?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ps2y/does_anyone_elses_period_do_this_to_them/</url><snippet>During the 'PMS' time of month (about 3-4 days before my period starts) I not only bloat and get moody, but also get SUPER cravey and REALLY hungry.  I want to eat everything, and I'm hungry enough TO eat everything!!  Then, the day my period starts, just like all my bloating goes STRAIGHT away, so do my cravings and hunger, and entire appetite.  I don't want to eat ANYTHING!  I have to force myself to eat.

Is this normal for anyone else?  It drives me nuts, ruins my diet, and makes me feel abnormal and fat.  I actually usually am able to tell my period is about to start because I begin to devour everything in sight, so no you're not the only one.  PRAISE JESUS!! Seriously I'm like 'NOM NOM NOM FOOOD!! Wait.. what's wrong?  Dammit!" Yeah, it sucks because I'm a student now and I can't afford my favourite pre-period cravings. It's usually the worst kind of food I want - lots of salt, just face stuffing .

Last period I was smoking a lot more too, and I had such a mega munchies combination. I was actually full for a day and a half after and only drank water, haha. My wallet loses all the weight I gain during my period Yeah, it sucks because I'm a student now and I can't afford my favourite pre-period cravings. It's usually the worst kind of food I want - lots of salt, just face stuffing .

Last period I was smoking a lot more too, and I had such a mega munchies combination. I was actually full for a day and a half after and only drank water, haha.   Exact same situation here. I nom on everything and always get an intense craving for chocolate. During my period, I get pimples, fever, more moody, nausea, cramps that feel like I'm being punched in the gut and then lit on fire. :(  And gassy - the worst smelling gas ever  Dealing with this right now. Oh god. I know how you feel. Can we not talk about what I ate for lunch I had 2 banana and sugar sandwiches. I crave sweet things lately when I'm due.  I had 2 banana and sugar sandwiches. I crave sweet things lately when I'm due.  Can we not talk about what I ate for lunch I had blueberry pie and tortilla chips with salsa for lunch today, I feel you (and my PMS lol) I just finished having 2 side salads, green beans, and spaghetti.  Now I'm ready for cake and ice cream Dinner was a salad of romaine, sweet peppers, and carrots and a plate of homemade mac and cheese (baked with a crispy panko topping!). Now, irish cream flavored coffee and hot cocoa mixed together. I wish I had ice cream :/

But next week, eating will make me nauseous and crampy. Ate the cake and ice cream.. it was too yummy.. can I have more? DAMN PERIOD!  Are you me? This describes me PERFECTLY.   Same here. I become ravenous constantly, and I also get suuuuuuuuper tired. I pretty much just turn into a giant baby for a few days. A very, very gassy baby. The worst gas ever Oh my god the smelllllll

I'm good at holding everything in until it's appropriate to let it out (bathroom, outside) but when I'm on my period it's just like fweeeeeept.  And then stench. Oh my god the smelllllll

I'm good at holding everything in until it's appropriate to let it out (bathroom, outside) but when I'm on my period it's just like fweeeeeept.  And then stench.    Well, I feel like I'm starving about a week before. Eat EVERYTHING in sight and then some. Also been sweet, sugary foods. Been known to eat brown sugar and condensed milk - though not together at the same time if no chocolate. Luckily though, I don't get the bloated feeling. And then once they hit, that's it. Not really hungry, but really horny. 

I think it's the body's way of storing up the energy it needs to cope with the periods.  I had a hot sex dream last night and was like "Yep - it's coming".  Why must we get so horny during the messiest time? I had a hot sex dream last night and was like "Yep - it's coming".  Why must we get so horny during the messiest time?  I do get bloated and hungry, but my main indicator is my mood. I'm generally a very calm person, but I always get super anxious on the first day of my period. So, I can always tell my period's coming because I get sudden and inexplicable bouts of anxiety.

It usually goes something along the lines of, "OMG I'm so worried, and there's no real reason why, and everything is scary, and I feel like the world might be about to end. What the hell? WHY AM I SO--oh. Hi, period."      I don't even like carbonated drinks (soda) but I'm downing my second can of Pepsi today. Aunt Flo's definitely coming by weekend.     My cycle,

Period, cramps, eating fine for a week, cramps, upset stomach, more cramps and food. Period  It has gotten to the point where I have given up trying to track myself by calendar, and have just settled on tracking myself by the appearance of INTENSE CRACKHEAD NEED FOR ALL THE BURGERS AND ICE CREAM AND FISH SANDWICHES. SRSLY, JUST TAKE A STEAK AND A SMOKED SALMON AND USE PIES FOR THE BUNS OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL LITERALLY DIE. One week later it's like, "Oh. Hey period. No more foods." 

Just accept the fact that you are a werewolf and everything will be okay.  Is it because we are about to loose the equivalent of a uterus and our brain is like: we need the extra calories to make up for our losses? (Or you know, the brain thinks we need the extra calories because of what is coming?)  I'm mostly vegetarian for the rest of the month but when I'm menstruating...MEAT! I WANT MEAT! RED MEAT! RARE! RAW! GIVE IT TO ME NOW!  I become a starving, raving bitchmonster right before my period starts. Then it starts and I bloat and cry about everything for five days. Woo.       I get this.  Plus my boobs hurt like hell, to the point where I can't even wear a bra (and I usually hate going braless even at home).  Also the day of my period anything I DO eat shoots right through me and comes out the other end.  Marvelous.  5 PM = NO BRAS ALLOWED in my house  </snippet></document><document><title>I don't feel "feminine" enough for my boyfriend</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qbwx/i_dont_feel_feminine_enough_for_my_boyfriend/</url><snippet>We've been together for 3 years, our relationship is going well. I feel inadequate though because I'm so tomboyish and I pretty much look like his younger brother when we are out in public. I skateboard a lot so I'm always bloody, bruised and my clothes are all torn.
If I'm not wearing torn up clothes, I'm wearing dungarees and steel toes because I work in trades.
I have zero fashion sense, and I'm too embarrassed to go shopping or to ask a friend for advice.
I don't know how to put on makeup, wear nice clothes, act lady-like and I really don't feel comfortable doing those things but I feel like my appearance embarrasses my boyfriend when we are out in public together. I'm still trying to figure myself out but I always feel awkward and a little ashamed when we go out for dinner or when we hold hands at the park or something.

He says it's fine that I don't and that he's glad "I'm not like other girls" but I still feel pressure to grow up and be a lady, and make him proud.

I know other people's opinions shouldn't matter, and that as long as we are happy there's nothing to worry about but I still feel a hankering to impress others and "make my boyfriend proud".

I didn't want to post in relationship advice because there's no trouble in the relationship, it's mostly my problem and I was curious if someone else has gone through this and if they had to come up with any solutions or compromises.  Sounds like me a few years ago. High-five!

ENJOY MY ESSAY

When I started to become more interested in self-grooming (around 21 years of age), my 'character' was so strongly formed amongst my friends and family, that it took much longer than it should have for me to be comfortable dressing up when I felt like it - they'd notice the slightest changes, and the added attention could often be uncomfortable. I got used to it, though, and so did they.

Here are some things that worked for me:

* If you trust your boyfriend, then you need to respect when he says 'it's fine'. Sounds like he loves you for who you are, not what you are (or aren't) wearing. Having said that, I completely understand the desire to make him proud, and being able to be both a tomboy and a lady when it pleases you is something my fiance says makes me 'me'. Don't ever feel like you aren't feminine enough for someone who loves you. You should be able to see him in trackpants and a hoodie, or a nice skirt and singlet, and get that lovely warm smile either way.

* I would suggest taking things slowly - if you spend a whole lot of time and money buying a dress, heels, stockings, a new hair-do and some make-up, only for your friends/family/boyfriend to tell you you look ridiculous (WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE HAS SHE GONE), you'll be back to square one. I'd suggest making smaller changes - like wearing tighter/more figure-flattering jeans, or perhaps a slightly more feminine t-shirt or singlet. Even smaller shoes, or brushing your hair a different way, wearing some jewellery...it makes a huge difference to your nearest and dearest.

* First, I explored my own tastes with colours and styles. When I was a more comfortable, I ask my partner what he thinks - too short, too bright, not soft enough, too impractical...I don't know how common it is to have a guy who doesn't mind discussing the finer characteristics of straight vs curly hair, but it is **quite** delightful, I assure you. MAN I LOVE THAT GUY.

* Use a little concealer if you have an uneven complexion, or a small amount of eye-shadow (natural browns, or perhaps a small amount of black/white) and a clear, non-shiny lip gloss to make you look a little smarter without getting all drag-queen about it. I used to muck around in the mirror by myself, just to see what looked okay, and what looked utterly ridiculous. LESS IS MORE, LET ME TELL YOU.

* Growing old is mandatory; growing up is optional, and *you do it whenever you damn well feel like it*, buddy. My first two boyfriends would barely recognise me in a dress; they wanted me to act more maturely/femininely and at that stage (18? 20?), that just wasn't who I was. my current one is difficult to surprise these days because he's pretty much seen the lot (I'm now 25), but he can appreciate both the over-sized t-shirt, as well as the skimpy little dresses that aren't worn in public.

* Stick with your favourite colours. If you like black, find black - black and denim is tried and true. If you like bright colours, find clothing that has a little colour in it, like belts or buttons. As I said above, you may want to avoid drastic changes, because they, well...can have drastic responses. OR MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFTER.

* There are plenty of 'tomboy' feminine styles out there, don't feel like you have to be in a skirt and heels to be feminine. Take your fella (or some close friends) shopping, and point out various items of clothing to see how they react. Don't be ashamed to tell them you want to feel a little prettier; my friends kinda get excited whenever I suggest a shopping trip for any reason. YAAY CARGO PANTS AND GUCCI HEELS

Eh, this is getting rather large. TL;DR: Small changes are better, trust your friends and family to support you as you change, and don't think you have to let go of everything you already are, to become something else - just add it to your style library. You aren't acting, or being someone else; you're just being you in a different way. GOOD LUCK BRO

I know you're a girl I call everyone bro Thank you! This is great advice, have to keep the small changes in mind. I really like the look of those small leather jackets and the low profile combat boots and over sized tank tops (mostly because they can go with my torn jeans and nobody in my life will be "surprised" that I'm wearing stuff like that) but I don't want to stand out too much so I need to find a middle ground. 

My career will never really require me to dress nice so there's no time limit I suppose I should be relieved so I have to opportunity to make the changes slowly.

I'm still (REALLY) shy to talk to my boyfriend about it because I feel vulnerable which is stupid on my part because he's so gentle. I think I'll need to make a courage-coffee before I bring it up.

He's been with you for 3 years... not the person society pushed you to be, just the bomb-ass babe you were born as. Anyone that faults you for that probably has their own insecurities to deal with and he's obviously not one of them.

Let's embrace this whole doing-whatever-we-want-because-we're-okay-with-ourselves thing that twox is all about.

 Haha I guess you're right. The bro-bump helped. Thank you :) It just so happens that a few hours ago I found out that I look like a boy!

/questionableladybrobump
 Me too. I can pass for a 12 year old boy if I wear a loose fitting shirt. I've embraced it at this point. The androgynous look that is. Never felt more at ease in my own skin. 

My hair is really short and bleached blond. I combine men's sweaters, cardigans and razorback tops with with slim fitting jeans, knee high boots and a leather jacket. Or boyfriend jeans, sneakers, a form fitting parka and big earrings.   We're one in the same my friend. Big ol chandelier earrings, doorknocker necklaces, cardis and skinnies.     To me, the most important part of being a "lady" is being respectful of yourself and others. If you feel that changing your appearance would be the best way to pursue this, then go for it! But it sounds to me like you have the most important parts down:

You've developed a strong, loving relationship with your boyfriend, something that many people don't master for a long time. You're able to take care of him and be caring and compassionate. You want to represent him well and make him proud of you.

You've found a hobby you're passionate about (skateboarding). It sounds like you're pretty involved/good at it, and you're willing to risk getting a few scrapes to have some fun! This shows that you're taking care of your body and your mind.

You've got a job and are able to support yourself if necessary. You aren't taking advantage of anybody's kindness, and you're hardworking.

These things all show that you're a lady, more than a dress or makeup will. Of course, if wearing these things make you feel good and confident, then you should give it a try! Changing your appearance to reflect yourself can be both satisfying and fun. However, I think the things I listed are much more important to your boyfriend than whether or not you look traditionally feminine. And in the end, I hope that these sorts of things are more important to you, too! This made me feel very good about myself, thank you.     Honestly best thing to do is just suck it up and let a good friend take you shopping. Ideally if you have one that has a bit of a tom-boy past they would be best as they will understand your hesitancy. I'd approach one that is low key but a little more femminine then you feel right now. That way you don't wind up getting into a situation where you are way out of your element. 

In terms of the makeup hit up /r/makeup addiction and start with the real basics. Pretty much learn how to apply basic neutral eye shadow with mascara and you'd be amazed what a difference it will make. Honestly makeup is just practice and you really only need one "look". Hit up Sephora or the makeup counter at Macy's and ask one of the girls to put together a really simple/easy to do basic look and they can help teach you how to do it (say no foundation as it's harder to do and probably not necessary unless you have major acne issues). Expect to plunk down a bit up front but the difference learning with good makeup vs crap is unbelievable.       </snippet></document><document><title>She gets a lot of scorn, but Danica Patrick qualified for the first pole position of the Daytona 500 today!</title><url>http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/17/sport/daytona-500-qualifying/?hpt=hp_t1</url><snippet>  Why the scorn?

Disagree strongly. The way I look at it, she is just pimped out for PR by professional racing, and in a degrading way. She's a mediocre driver and she gets attention only because she is a woman, shining the spotlight on her as much as they do is basically indirectly saying that she is pretty much the best a woman can perform in a male dominated sport.

Secondly, we shouldn't give people attention or act like they are the greatest thing since sliced bread because of their race, gender or sexual orientation, they should be recognized by their accomplishments. I understand it can be harder for certain races/genders/whatever to perform in certain environments for a multitude of reasons, but usually pointing out how different people are is done in a classless way that just draws attention to differences, not their actual accomplishment.

Ahhhh, that was really quite a good article and then they finished with this:

SHE IS A FUCKING NASCAR DRIVER, OF COURSE SHE SOUNDS LIKE ONE. What they seem to mean is 'she sounds like a man'. Grrrr. I think you are reading into that with your own bias.   NASCAR drivers are *particularly* well known for drinking beer?

This couple didn&#8217;t get &#8220;gay married.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;gay wedding.&#8221; They got married. They had a wedding.

This really strikes home for me.  It reminds me of my friends/acquaintances who don't seem to understand I'm still me, even if I'm gay.  I'm not gay me, I don't do gay things.  I'm just me.  I feel like I've been reduced to a part of something else instead of being me. I would very much like to believe her sentiment but it is the cynic in me that thinks she might just be targeting a niche group. 

Is that her best shot? maybe, but it's probably her most controversial one. She's making a statement by using an image of a same-sex couple, and it is in some ways a very admirable one but it is definitely very aware of itself. 

It might please you to note that according to [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/us/16marriage.html?_r=0) NY times article from 2010 that both Martha Stewart Weddings and Conde Nast Brides, two huge publications, have published features on same sex weddings with no special mention that the couple was gay. Just treated it exactly the same as a heterosexual couple's feature. I wish I could find links to the features, but alas this just what google turns up. 

   As cynical as it sounds I think this controversy is probably going to end up being better advertising for Anne Almasy than the actual ad. Looking at Weddings Unvieled's website certainly doesn't make them look like a high end operation with a tremendous reach. Whereas the ensuing coverage about the ad's rejection probably has a much wider reach.

But yeah it is ridiculous in this day and age to reject same sex marriage - even from a purely business standpoint let alone the moral one. Best to get a head start in that market before anyone else does.   They've reversed their decision and will be running the ad. And they wrote an actual heartfelt apology about it, which is ultra rare. So, a happy ending.

I completely agree with you that putting the ad in shouldn't have been an issue in the first place, but she definitely knew what she was doing. To be honest that photo was just mediocre for me....The story was much more interesting.

And this line, "this couple&#8217;s wedding portrait is every bit as beautiful and valuable" seems ill-chosen. In that she's stating that her work is beautiful and valuable, it feels a little too self-promotional.  I don't understand this. Doesn't the wedding industrial complex have more to gain from being inclusive?  I don't understand this. Doesn't the wedding industrial complex have more to gain from being inclusive?  I don't understand this. Doesn't the wedding industrial complex have more to gain from being inclusive?  I guess they weighed (in their minds) the risks of alienating gay-friendly and gay couples versus the risk of alienating homophobic couples and decided which group they think is bigger. Really sad.

I'm really glad this photographer stuck to her guns instead of switching photos and also glad that she is bringing attention to the screwed prorities of this magazine Wedding Unveiled.

Edit: oops. I just finished and it looks like the negative publicity encouraged the magazine's editors to change their mind and run the ad. Yay! Like you said, though, they likely changed their minds because now it turns out that not running the ad is resulting in worse publicity than quietly declining.</snippet></document><document><title>Need some help with pad/tampon usage. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18r5hy/need_some_help_with_padtampon_usage/</url><snippet>So I'm 15 and just started using tampons. I got my period late, so it's only my third period.
Anyways, I was just wondering about tampon usage. Right now I'm using tampons during the day, and pads at night. It says on the package to alternate with pads to reduce the risk of TSS, but I was just wondering what they mean by alternating. Can I not use tampons during the day for my whole period, every period? Should I do every other day with pads, or every other period, or what?
Thanks so much!


Also, at the moment taking the tampons out hurts a little. It's not extremely painful, but I was wondering if this ever goes away with more practice, or if it will always be a little painful to remove a tampon.  TSS, although very serious, is a small risk.  [Here is an awesome discussion about it in medical and historical context](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/15tgaw/tss_and_tampons_history_and_truth/).  So, yes, you can wear one overnight without having to wake up to change it (unless you know that you need to change it because it's full).  Yes, you can wear them everyday of your period, every period.  You're fine provided that you change them as frequently as possible, within your needs.

When removing a tampon, be sure to relax your muscles as this helps a lot.  Also, if it hurts often, then probably the tampon isn't full.  Use the smallest absorbency that you need (So, don't use a super plus if your flow is pretty light, etc.).  You'll learn to keep various sizes as you get used to your flow.

Though I was an avid tampon user, I personally felt it was nicer to give my lady parts a break by switching to a pad every now and then.  You can also consider a menstrual cup like the Diva cup/Moon cup/etc. which have advantages tenfold to disposable pads and tampons. Everything you said is true, but I just want to clarify that changing tampons fairly often means using the right size as well. If you're using too absorbent tampons, it's better to let them fill and leave them in a little extra long (like an hour or two over the 8 hour maximum) than to pull out a really dry tampon, which is more likely to tear the vaginal walls and the tampons and leave bits of cotton inside that can breed the bacteria that causes TSS. You're correct.  It's that little dance that you learn over time about when to switch from an Ultra (can't believe they stopped making those) to a Super Plus, etc.  Which is why I was fond of switching to pads every now and then because it was getting hard to figure out how much would be coming out on certain days.  My flow varies so it isn't very predictable.  ^^Damn ^^I ^^love ^^my ^^Divacup I was advised to use pads for my first few periods so I could get used to knowing when my flow was generally lighter or heavier. Learning what patterns my flow followed meant I could better predict what size tampon to use when. ( It was a good theory but i hated pads so managed just one period before using tampons so kudos if you can hold out for a few cycles!) I now have a cup which is awesome!  You're correct.

You can also consider a menstrual cup like the Diva cup/Moon cup/etc. which have advantages tenfold to disposable pads and tampons. Thanks! I'm using regular right now and leaving them in for 4-5 hours. 

I'm not sure how soaked they should be, but they seem pretty full.  You have to be the judge.  If it seems full, then take them out.  While you're experimenting, maybe wear a backup panty liner or a super thin pad just in case there is spotting.  You'll eventually know when to switch between tampon sizes, as it might vary from day to day.  With some fluctuations, I usually went Regular - Super - Super Plus - Super Plus - Super - Regular - Regular.  Because if I would wear a Regular on a Super Plus day, that Regular would be soaked in an hour...  So of course I'd take it out regardless of the 'time limit'.  But if I put in a Super Plus on a Regular day, then it might hurt when I pull it out unless I give it a few more hours.  No problem there.

Essentially, the time limit is a recommended guideline.  Any far deviation from that (like, nearing to a day to anything over a full day), is cause for concern.  Even then, chances of TSS are very very low, but why not do everything possible to minimize those risks even further, right?   You can alternate as much as you like, the important thing is to change your tampon at least every 4 hours. 

And as for the discomfort of using the tampon, you may need to go down in absorbency. If there is not enough fluid its hard to pull out, with insertion you can try another position like standing, knee up or sitting. Thanks so much! I never even considered that it might be hurting because it was too full, in fact I thought the opposite.  It won't be painful if it is "too full" it will be slippery and probably come right out. It might just be hurting because you're not relaxed enough or it's not full enough and dry  Thanks so much! I never even considered that it might be hurting because it was too full, in fact I thought the opposite.   When I was getting my period (I'm on BC and stay on the active pills now) I used tampons during the day and night until my flow lightened and then I switched to pads at night. I changed my tampon every 4-6 hours during the day depending on flow and never had a problem leaving one in overnight for 7-8 hours (sometimes even a little longer). If you are prone to yeast infections or UTIs this might not work for you, but I never had an issue with it myself. 

My periods used to last anywhere from 4-7 days and I used tampons every day and night for the majority of its duration. The only time I used a pad was when it got too light for the use of a tampon. I never had a problem with it.

As far as the pain when removing the tampon goes, it could be that you are using the wrong absorbency or that it hasn't been in long enough to have absorbed much. Dry cotton doesn't feel so good coming out. That's been the case in my experience at least. If you notice the tampon is mostly dry when you remove it, but it's been in for hours, then try switching to a lower absorbency. Thanks so much! I never even considered that it might be hurting because it was too full, in fact I thought the opposite. I think I'll continue using pads overnight for now, though.  It shouldn't hurt if it's too full- it'll hurt if it's too dry, which is why you'd switch to a lower absorbency if that's the case (use a light if the regular one hurts to remove). Sorry, maybe I worded that weird before.   I use tampons all day every day for every period. I've never heard that you have to alternate them, and I've been using tampons for a decade.  When you take the tampon out, is it soaked with blood, or basically all white? Sometimes it hurts when it's super dry and there is no lubrication on the way out. How often do you change your tampons? You may be changing them too often.</snippet></document><document><title>Insecure</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18r56r/insecure/</url><snippet>Hi everyone. I struggle with some crippling insecurity that causes issues in my intimate relationships, namely jealousy. It eats me up inside, and only a LOT of time and self-talk helps. I'm not in a position where I can go to therapy. Can anyone recommend some self-help books? Thanks!  Jealousy can be misplaced or it can be a warning sign. Do you find yourself jealous in just your current relationship or is this a more broad issue you've had all your life? Does it extend past just romantic relationships?

Maybe read (search box for "jealous") or post in /r/relationships with more specifics. I've been jealous in my past relationships, but I don't find myself experiencing any gut-wrenching jealously outside of them - I'm envious of other people for one reason or another, but it's never been an issue. How is it an issue now; what is different/changed? I don't think I was very clear: I'm ONLY this jealous within my romantic relationships. I only experience fleeting, mild envy OUTSIDE of relationships. This crippling jealousy occurs when I'm interested in someone/dating them, and it has been this way for as long as I can remember. 

I feel like it comes from being insecure. If I go to a party where a girl I perceive to be much better looking than me is present, I instantly feel self conscious and have a hard time having fun. I look in the mirror more times than I can count in a day to make sure I look alright - that my makeup isn't smudged, that there isn't anything in my nose or teeth, that my hair looks good.   Is it jealousy when they look at another, or also jealousy when they spend time with friends? What phase of life are you in? </snippet></document><document><title>Why Gender Equality Stalled - NYTimes.com</title><url>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/why-gender-equality-stalled.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Questions about abstinence in a long-term relationship. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qi9d/questions_about_abstinence_in_a_longterm/</url><snippet>Wow, I don't even know where to start. This is kind of weird for me. 

I've been agnostic for the better part of a decade. I started working at an Episcopal church almost a year ago. I've tried and tried to have faith, but I struggle with it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. We've talked about religion, and he's much more devout than I am, but he never goes to church. Not only is he religious, but he's very morally conservative and kind of old fashioned about a lot of things. Usually, I love this about him. He respects women, doesn't *ever* pressure me for sex or make any disparaging comments about women or sexuality... He's wonderful. 

I went to church last weekend, and again today. I really enjoy it, and I'm finding that faith is more than a blind belief that defies logic and reason. Although I can't say exactly, I feel very good about this, and I want to share it with my boyfriend. So, I brought it up to him, and asked him, again, why he doesn't attend church. 

He has some beliefs that he's been wrestling with for a long time, one of which is premarital sex. We've been sexually active for nearly the whole time we've been dating, and it's been fantastic... he taught me that sex can be emotional, loving, a means to bring two people closer together. Needless to say, I've not had good experiences with sex in the past. 

We talked about the idea of making our relationship a sexless one... until marriage. We're not engaged, and there aren't any plans to be engaged soon. While I can definitely see the value in being abstinent, it scares me shitless. I've been sexually active since I was 14, more than 12 years. I had an unhealthy relationship with sex for a long time, and I only began to rectify that after I was raped. Now, he and I both use sex as a method of emotional closeness.... we can't tell each other how we feel about the other, so we compensate with physical intimacy. 

I told him I would be willing to forgo sex if we could find a way to retain the intimacy of our relationship. Ladies, how do I do this? 'Making love' instead of 'getting fucked' was a whole new concept to me when I began this relationship (I had horrible taste in men, and they always seemed to force me into the 'submissive' role in the BDSM scene; I don't actually like any kink for myself). Now, I feel like I've got a healthy relationship with sex and my partner, except that I'm still using it for the connection. How do I get that without sex? What kinds of things can we do (non-sexual) that will allow us to maintain the connection, the intimacy? How can I cope/manage my libido during abstinence? I don't want to simply divert the sex instinct... I'm perfectly capable of getting myself off, and I've done so in the past. The problem is that self-gratification only leaves me longing for my partner... I want to share that moment with him. I end up being less fulfilled than when I started. 

Have any of you gone through this? How did you handle it?  Honestly, if you need to withhold something from your relationship in order to feel like you have a better relationship, maybe something about your relationship isn't right. You've only been together a year and a half - you already need to look for ways to keep the relationship alive?? Why even hang onto a relationship that's that much work so early into it? Relationships should be easy - not something you have to make a huge fundamental change for in just the first year and a half. 

I don't even know what you mean by using sex to be intimate. Yeah... sex is intimate. So is kissing, stroking (non sexual), cuddling, sharing your day, sharing your inner most thoughts and desires, sharing trust, etc etc. I don't get why you'd *stop* doing something that is intimate in order to be *more* intimate.

I think you two have encountered a really skewed and unhealthy idea about sex from your church and you're trying to figure out how it would work in your own relationship and it just isn't making any sense. Stop being intimate in order to be more intimate. Huh!? What makes you think sex is the only way you two are being intimate? What makes you think that stopping sex would improve your relationship in any way? What makes you think denying your fundamental sexual urges is going to benefit you or be healthy for you?   My boyfriend and I tried to stop having sex once..it was awful. We lasted about a week. It's just so hard to go back once you've crossed that line. 

 I'm assuming he's the one that initiated this desire to become abstinent again,  since you aren't as religious and these things usually are religiously motivated. So you'll probably feel like you'll have to tiptoe around, lest you arouse him and make him feel guilty for "sinning in his heart" and all that nonsense just like I did. 

Out of curiosity, what kind of benefits do you think you would gain out of becoming abstinent in a relationship that is already sexually active?  Yeah really, never in a million years would I do something like this.  I guess its a different strokes different folks kind of deal but god sex is the thing that keeps me most sane and most happy in my life, its the primary language of intimacy my partner and I share (my partner and I both use touch/sex as our "[love language](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/)").  

I wouldn't even know where to start for something like this, I mean when I was single the hardest part was the lack of sex/intimacy, I can't imagine how you'd manage in a relationship not being able to touch and love your partner like that.  Maybe its different for people who's libidos are lower but I feel like doing something like this would destroy me.  Oh there's no way I would be able to go indefinitely without sex. After a month I start to get all twitchy.

I'm just worried OP is getting pressured into this. It almost sounds like she's trying to convince herself that it's a good idea. She never mentions why her bf decided he wants to become abstinent or for how long. It's just throwing up a bunch of red flags in my head.  My boyfriend and I tried to stop having sex once..it was awful. We lasted about a week. It's just so hard to go back once you've crossed that line.

Out of curiosity, what kind of benefits do you think you would gain out of becoming abstinent in a relationship that is already sexually active?  In our entire relationship, we've (unintentionally) gone 4-5 weeks, twice, without sex. Once because he was out of town, and at the beginning of this year due to illness. We did both times with minimal difficulty, but obviously there were extenuating circumstances. We usually have sex once a week, or once every two weeks as it is. We're both very busy: he's self-employed and works long hours when he's got a project, and I'm an office manager during the day, and I attend school full-time at night. We talk every day on the phone for a good amount of time, but see each other 2-3 times a week. 

Actually, this was a mutual thing, although he's definitely more for it than I am. I've been thinking about it a lot recently.... I have friends who quit having sex, and since I work for a church... well, it comes up, you know?

&amp;gt;So you'll probably feel like you'll have to tiptoe around, lest you arouse him and make him feel guilty for "sinning in his heart"

I've been very clear with him about my feelings about sex: that is, sex outside of marriage is not inherently wrong. The most important thing, to me, is the motives behind this. If he's wanting this because he thinks sex is sinful or dirty, then we must talk about that, because I think that's an unhealthy view of sex. I told him that I think our making love is beautiful, an amazing experience. As such, I refuse to feel guilty for whatever feelings of lust come up for him. I'm attracted to him; he's attracted to me. Sexual desire is *natural*. I won't "play a tease" or anything, but being attracted to my partner (and their attraction to me) is a must for a healthy relationship. 

I've found that, sometimes, the most difficult things are the most rewarding. After I was beaten and raped, the hardest things was asking for help. But doing so completely changed my life... for the better. Likewise, the last time I went abstinent (more than two years ago, now) was the most rewarding, healing time for me. For the first time, I found peace in myself, and happiness outside of a man. I think (hope) undertaking this with him will allow us to become closer by removing the crutch of physical love. When we *have* to tell each other how we feel because we can't just jump into bed... that has value to me, you know? When I was abstinent last time, I learned how to care for myself, how to love myself. Can't that translate to a relationship? 

I'm not saying this will be easy - quite the opposite. But it's an option I want to explore. This could work for you, it could not. 

I just have this sinking feeling that being in the environment your in has made you more receptive to your boyfriend's idea than you would usually be on your own. 

There is so much pressure to conform in the church (at least in my experience)..the stories you're getting from your friend and coworkers are most likely heavily edited to make them look better and giving you a false impression of the merits of abstinence while hiding all of its flaws.


By the way, if you haven't you should ask you boyfriend why he wants to do this before jumping in headfirst. Set your boundaries and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. 





 &amp;gt;being in the environment your in has made you more receptive to your boyfriend's idea than you would usually be on your own

Yes. Without a doubt. But that doesn't make it *bad*, necessarily. I know it's not a popular idea, and it's not a popular decision... but if it's important to my partner, then I think it's important to give it thought. It's very, very scary to me.... My partner and I, like every other couple in a relationship, have problems. I'm hoping this is a solution to some of them... and I guess I'm hoping this is temporary. Our lack of proximity to even being engaged makes me very nervous.

The Episcopal church has less pressure to conform than other denominations - it's one of the most attractive things about it to me. My boss's wife has said that she sees nothing wrong with premarital sex; it's definitely a denomination that encourages every person to make their own decisions. :) 

I asked him tonight about his reasons for wanting to do this. He gave me a few reasons, and one of them (the using sex as a tool for emotional connections) actually makes me very willing to go abstinent, for a time. 

I just.... this is so new to me, and such a unique position, not one I ever thought I'd be in. Like every new experience, it's very scary. I *know* sex in a relationship - I don't know abstinence. In our entire relationship, we've (unintentionally) gone 4-5 weeks, twice, without sex. Once because he was out of town, and at the beginning of this year due to illness. We did both times with minimal difficulty, but obviously there were extenuating circumstances. We usually have sex once a week, or once every two weeks as it is.

I'm not saying this will be easy - quite the opposite. But it's an option I want to explore.    Your boyfriend has a false understanding of premarital sex in the Bible.  The Bible never outlaws premarital sex.  All the sexual rules are listed in Leviticus, and premarital sex is never outlawed.  

The Bible's rule about premarital sex seems to be that its ok as long as you are in a committed relationship with somebody you love. 

The Bible is, however, totally not cool with cheating.  Would you mind helping me out here? I thought that "adultery" was considered all sex outside of marriage. Is that not right?

Even if that's the case, I don't think I'd change his mind about that... but it can't hurt to know. :)   Based on the hive-mind I have encountered personally, as well as the comments you have already gotten, I don't know if you are going to find much support from this subreddit. Maybe try out /r/Christianity, though you will get some of the same lack of advice there too probably.

Sex should always be a mutual decision between you and your partner. If you are serious about redefining your sexual life, I suggest a long sit-down conversation between the two of your first, laying down ground rules and the parameters you want to establish, perhaps also giving yourselves a trial period with this rather than jumping in with both feet right now. Try talking to your priest/pastor/minister as well if your S.O. feels comfortable with it (you can talk to your church leader by yourself too, if that works for you).

That being said, structure the time that you and your S.O. spend together. Try cooking meals together, or take up a hobby that you can share. Try new things, maybe take a class together that you are both interested in. Focus on "friend" things that still have you spending time together. Spending quality time together will be potentially even more important than it was before, as will communication. 

Best of luck to you both!    My boyfriend and I are waiting. We spend an hour every day cuddling and talking - usually 30 minutes right before bed and 30 minutes when we wake up. It's not for everyone, but our relationship is extremely strong. If you don't mind me asking: are y'all living together? My bf and I don't, and we see each other 2-3xs per week.... I'm not sure if this could work for us, but I can definitely see the possibilities! Thank you for your input. :) You really have no idea how much I appreciate it. :)</snippet></document><document><title>[Update] Well 2X, she's pregnant. We aren't keeping it. How can I support her?

I was mostly just ranting and freaking out in the first thread, so I never really responded to anyone.  I did read everything that was posted though, and there were a lot of comforting words there.  It helped.  A lot.  Thank you.

We've been to a doctor and had the pregnancy confirmed, and things have been very upside-down the past few days.  We've sat and talked more seriously in the past few than we probably have in a long time.  We talked about our feelings, our futures, what we both want out of life, and what this would mean.

We have hugged, cried, and held each other so much.  I'm trying to be strong for her, but it's tough.  This isn't what either of us wanted.  We sat down and had **the talk** on our couch a few days ago.  We both talked out everything, but it felt like we were both talking around the conclusion.  Neither of us wanted to say it.  She asked me what I thought we should do, and the words just caught in my throat.  There was probably a 2 minute silence because I just couldn't say it out loud.

Finally, she said it for me.  "I think we should terminate this pregnancy."  We both started crying.  We both want children, we both want to be parents, but this is the worst possible time.

It feels selfish.  It makes us both feel guilty, like we're choosing ourselves over an innocent.  The choice feels like choosing between the lives we wanted and lives of struggling poverty.  Telling ourselves that it's the right decision in the long-term is such a cold comfort.

She had been an emotional wreck ever since we found out she was pregnant, and it's only gotten worse.  The strong woman that I married seems so frail now.  She cries all the time.  She constantly worries that any little thing is going to make her miscarry.  She feels responsible for her earlier miscarriage, and she blames herself.  She's worried that any little thing will make her miscarry again.

We're supposed to go see my family soon, to celebrate getting married.  I'm scared to death (and so is she) that she's going to have a breakdown in front of them.  My parents (my father especially) are going to think that we eloped *because* she was pregnant.  It just fits into the awful image they have of her.  I hate it.

We're checking with women's clinics to see about the abortion, but we don't know how long the wait will be (closed on the weekends).  Because of the fucking stupid laws in our state, she'll have to have an ultrasound and have the baby's features pointed out to her, like she's an idiot who can't make her own decisions.  I will never give an ounce of support to any "pro-life" candidate ever again.  Fuck them for making her go through that.  They have no idea how awful this is.

I talked with her about seeing a counselor, but she won't do it.  She's so detached now.  She cries randomly.  We should be happy we were just married.  Instead, this.  I try to comfort her, help her, and support her, but it doesn't seem to do any good.  She dwells on things when they upset her, and she's dwelling on this so to such an extent that I'm worried it's tearing her apart.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I don't have anyone to talk to about it.  I just need to get it out.  I'm still trying to be there with her as much as possible.  I'm just worried I'm not actually helping.

**tl;dr:** We're going to get the abortion.  Shit is awful.  :( I'm sorry you two are having such a hard time right now. A counselor would go her a world of good, but she just might not be ready to face all of it. Is there any way, any at all, that you could postpone the trip to your family? If they are as toxic as you've said (of course, only going on what you've posted her and in the other post), the visit and any upset that arises during it will only make it that much harder on her. It sound to me as if her mental health is shaken right now. You need to help keep her as healthy as possible now. Your parents' needs just don't supersede that.  Sorry you're going through this.

I agree if she's suffering you may need to come up with an excuse to not visit your parents. I also don't see how telling them about the pregnancy will be beneficial to them, or you, or your wife. It seems that that's your business, and you'd do well to consider the possibility of *not* telling them at all.

It sounds like your wife doesn't *want* to terminate the pregnancy, but feels *obligated* to do so. Make sure you're not contributing to that feeling of obligation in any way. Have her talk to a counselor by herself, and perhaps then together. 

We don't always get the things we want when we want or need them. It doesn't sound like she's in a very good place mentally. The best thing you can do for this woman that you love is let her know that she must do what her *heart* tells her, not convention. And be prepared to support her.

ANd for what it's worth- people have children all the time without launching themselves into poverty. In many cases, being faced with a decision of abortion vs. poverty is bordering on hyperbole. People have children by accident and do okay *all* the time. I know several. It's not an either/or proposition.

This is heart wrenching not because i'm some staunch pro-lifer (I'm very much pro-choice), but because she sounds like she really *really* doesn't want to have an abortion- and her last miscarriage experience will make things worse.  I know some people here won't like me for saying that, but so be it. Thank you.

She wants to be a mother.  This isn't the choice she wants in her heart, but it's what she thinks is right in the long-term.  It's wrenching for both of us.  So much more so for her than me.  &amp;gt; Because of the fucking stupid laws in our state, she'll have to have an ultrasound and have the baby's features pointed out to her, like she's an idiot who can't make her own decisions.

Understand that the medical staff hate this as much as you do, or more.  *They have to say it, but she doesn't have to listen.*  Bring headphones and tunes, and they will understand *completely*.  (Actually, they may very well *thank her* for sparing *them* the indignity.)   As someone else mentioned, it sounds like she has come to this conclusion because she feels like she HAS to, not because it is what she wants.  I made the same decision.  In fact, I made it twice, because I couldn't go through with the first appointment.  In the end, I couldn't go through with the second one either.  Were things hard for the first year or two?  Absolutely.  Did it change my life plans?  Yes.  Would I go back and change my decision now?  No way.  

I think my concern here (and understand that I have been in that position, and am completely pro-choice), is that it has to be something that she is actually okay with.  From what you've said here (I didn't see your original post) it does NOT sound to me like she is, and this is a recipe for future emotional trauma.  

She needs a counselor, and I think that she needs to know that if she cannot go through with the abortion, you'll still be there for her either way.   I'm sorry you guys are going through this. I had an abortion a week ago Saturday, and I had a simliar experience. I'm not married, but we were in love and just couldn't reasonably support a child, and had a very similar experience as you did. I was so low during that week and half I was pregnant before the procedure, it was a dark place I don't want to go to again. But I will say, it got better once the procedure was over. It was long, and sometimes terrible, but once my hormone levels returned to normal, I felt like myself again. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and although I do get sad (it's only been a week after all), I get sad with my rational mind, and not to the degree I did when I was pregnant. Best of luck. I know it's not easy.     &amp;gt; she'll have to have an ultrasound and have the baby's features pointed out to her, like she's an idiot who can't make her own decisions.

Are you sure about this? From what I've heard of other women's experiences, they do an ultrasound, but she isn't obligated to look at it or hear the fetus's features. Anyway, I think she needs to see a counselor before and/or after the procedure. It sounds like she's taking it very hard.

&amp;gt; She's worried that any little thing will make her miscarry again.

I'm no doctor, but I don't think miscarriages work like that. Either it's going to happen or it's not. It doesn't really have to do with things the mother does.  </snippet></document><document><title>Facing the possibility of miscarriage</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qlhm/facing_the_possibility_of_miscarriage/</url><snippet>After a positive result on a pregnancy test &amp;amp; much inner conflict on whether to keep it I am now facing possible miscarriage.

We'd agreed to keep it &amp;amp; now I may be losing it. 

How do I cope with the loss of someone that never was? We arent partners so there will be no second attempt. This was an accident to begin with.  Definitely line up a couple of people you trust to support you during and after the miscarriage. No one knew I was pregnant when I miscarried, and it made it hard not being able to share the loss with anyone. If it feels right, mourn for the loss, I certainly did and ours wasn't exactly planned either. 

Recognise that if you do miscarry you may be triggered by things for a while afterwards, it took me about a month before I could look at random babies and not get upset. 

Depending on how far along you are, you may bleed heavier and longer than a normal period. When I passed the fetus I had the same nauseated feeling that I now know is my cervix dilating.

A miscarriage is not your fault, it is most likely an issue with the fetus, not something you've done/not done, so do not beat yourself up about it. 

I'm so sorry you're going through this.  A miscarriage can be difficult, especially if you are looking forward to pregnancy and birth.  Given that the father is not likely to be there to support you, line up your support structure now.  Find people who can support you in your decision, as well as the loss if it occurs.  Some people like to talk about loss, others prefer not to.  Find people who are comfortable with whatever level of communication you are looking for.  

And while this will not help in the short term, in the long term realize that having a permanent tie to someone who is not your partner, and not likely to be around long term is very difficult.  So while you did not wish to end this pregnancy yourself, it is quite possible that its end is for the best. Also, most miscarriages are the result of genetic issues with the fetus, so it is not you. He has been great actually. We have a difficult time with being together but we are friends.

Been trying to tell myself its for the best.

Thanks Having him there as a friend is a good thing.  Hopefully he will support you in this as well.  But do line up others, especially if he was very ambivalent about the pregnancy in the first place. Nothing less helpful than someone who is greatly relieved while you are grieving.

P.S.  Keep in mind that most people who have an early  miscarriage can have children with no difficulty later.  So don't get yourself into mourning your fertility.  It hurts like hell. I know this far too well, after several losses myself. Just know that this is normal, most first pregnancies miscarry, and you can eventually still get pregnant if you choose. I havent had any pain, but Im bleeding alot. If I miscarry I dont plan to try again. Okay. The hurting, for me, was more emotional than anything. The bleeding.... well, this early on there is nothing you can really do. Just rest, avoid caffeine and hope.  Im hoping for the best, preparing for the worst. The not knowing is killing me Have you gotten anything back or tried taking another test?  What are your symptoms?  Do you have an OB? Spotting started last week, now Im bleeding as if having my normal period except there is more clotting. I havent had any cramps or pains.  I dont know what an OB is, but Im getting a blood test today to see if my pregnancy hormones have dropped OB is just obstetrician.  I don't want to give you false hope but some spotting and bleeding in the first trimester is very common.  If you aren't having cramping that is a good sign as well.

Are they doing the blood test twice?  Ideally they'll look at your hCG levels 2-3 days apart to see if they're increasing normally (just reading it once doesn't tell you much). Yes I had a blood test last week &amp;amp; hopfully they can tell me something from todays test. Its the not knowing that is driving me crazy so Im really hoping to get the results back this afternoon I understand.  I had something similar happen my first trimester.  They got back to me the next day I think.

Keep us posted.

Then I had it for months on end in my late 30s-early 40s (had sonagrams, biopsies. All healthy. Was told "These things happen" by my gyno).

Now my period is somewhat regular. I have it for 3-4 days but the cramps are awful. I didn't have insurance for over a year so I put up with it. I'm hot all the time. I used to love wearing flannel PJs and cuddling under blankets in the winter. Now I wear t-shirts and shorts and can only have a top sheet on me in the middle of the winter. I'm also exhausted all the time and my memory is for crap. MOOD SWINGS galore!

I mentioned this to a friend who is 58 and she said, "Sweetheart, I think you're perimenopausal." It was an "A-ha!" moment! I've had such difficulty with my cycles from the get-go that I can't recognize what is "normal."

  Calcium and vitamin D - are you taking your vitamins?  Also, have your iron levels and thyroid checked.

I really want to know why. This is all part of being a woman. And in my 46 years I went through things that I hope you don't have to go through. And, yes, I made a fuss. Don't worry about the down votes.  Some of them are automatically generated. There has also been some down vote trolling in several of the female oriented subreddits lately. Pay it no heed.

(X post from truereddit)</title><url>http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/11/going_dutch.single.html</url><snippet>  I guess for me I see a problem in this that it puts pressure on the Dutch men that they cannot have this free, female lifestyle because it is their duty to support their wives. I don't think it's a bad thing for an individual to choose to work part-time and enjoy their life. (Though it's not a bad thing to choose to be busy all the time either. My aunt gets bored and feels useless if she's not being productive and so she works all the time. She's a also a very happy person who loves her life.) However, if you try to divide up people by gender, it seems like it would lend itself to this culture where individuals actually have less freedom to choose for themselves how they want to live.

I'm not sure that's exactly what's happening in the Netherlands, since I doubt anyone would mind terribly much if a man wanted to work part-time and be financially supported by his wife, or any other different family structure, but it is interesting that the gender-based legislature mentioned exists. I wonder, if it's about motherhood, do they have laws that protect fathers in the same way? If they don't, that seems unjust to me. I'm from the Netherlands (and a Dutch family - of course there are also people who don't originate from the Netherlands who live here). As far as I know there is no problem with a stay-at-home-dad here, or working moms. Most people who are stay at home, with or without children, do that because they like it.

About the laws. We have maternity-leave by law. For woman this is roughly 6 week before the due date + 10 weeks after the delivery (so 16 weeks in total). Although it can be extended or shortened if people want to. For the partner (the rules are non-gender specific) there are 2 days of maternity leave after the delivery. 

After these weeks are done, there is "parental-leave", which is the same for both parents. This should be higher. As a dutch person I feel the system works pretty well in allowing people to live their life the way they want to live it.

I do feel that the title of the article is slightly misleading

&amp;gt; Women in the Netherlands work less, have lesser titles and a big gender pay gap

If they work less, they're obviously going to have fewer titles. And having fewer titles and working less is obviously going to lead to earning less. So there's not necessarily a gender pay gap, but a title and working hours pay gap instead. I think 'titles' refers to educational qualifications? &amp;amp; I'm not an expert, but I get the impression that if you're American &amp;amp; have an undergrad qualification, you almost certainly have a Masters or higher qual to go with it, because a 'college' degree is not worth much. Girls are doing better than boys here on academics, so I assumed it was about business titles.  I guess for me I see a problem in this that it puts pressure on the Dutch men that they cannot have this free, female lifestyle because it is their duty to support their wives. I don't think it's a bad thing for an individual to choose to work part-time and enjoy their life. (Though it's not a bad thing to choose to be busy all the time either.

I wonder, if it's about motherhood, do they have laws that protect fathers in the same way? If they don't, that seems unjust to me.  I agree with one of the comments below the article, this really doesn't talk about single unattached women, married women without kids, single mothers, or just plain poorer women/families. And seeing the flowery way the writer describes the easy life of these women, it has me wondering about the men... are they just happy to be mindless work robots with little free time?


I just don't like how when this type of lifestyle gets glorified, all the people it can't be applied to get glossed over :(   As someone from a Dutch family, maybe I can add some perspective.  The Dutch attitude towards a lot of issues on gender (which are very divisive in the US) are quite different.  In the Netherlands women have always kept their last names, and there has, at least it modern times, been a much more laid back attitude towards women and careers/education.  For instance, my grandmother (who was born in 1898) had a research medical doctorate (an MD that also had the equivalent of a PhD component), and this was not that unusual then.  Her best friend was her roommate in med school and she (the friend) never pursued a career in medicine after getting her degree.  She just went to med school because she was bright and the daughter of a rich family and she just didn't know what else to do with herself.  So, even though they went to one of the most prestigious medical schools at the time (Leiden), a woman didn't need to have crazy ambition to do get in or finish.

Maybe Dutch women feel like they don't need to make a point by being ambitious, everyone in Holland knows they are equally capable to men, so why not work less and enjoy life more?   Uhm, I'm afraid your perspective of Dutch society is a little too rosy. 

Dutch married women haven't always been able to keep their last names  and though women were allowed to study and work, they were automatically fired on their wedding day until 1956. 

Also, while in theory men and women are equal, we have a ridiculously low percentage of women in high positions.  &amp;gt;Dutch married women haven't always been able to keep their last names 

Formally, women did not change their name upon getting married, as a general rule of thumb; certainly not automatically. Most women started using their husbands names anyway, but this was about social expectations more than legal rules.

&amp;gt;and though women were allowed to study and work, they were automatically fired on their wedding day until 1956. 

This was the case between 1924 and 1956. Both before and after that period, working was quite common for maried women.

Interesting. My MIL apparently wasn't aware of that, after 45 years she's still miffed at being forced to take her husband's name. Maybe it wasn't customary to tell women that they had a choice in this matter?

&amp;gt; Which is kind of the point of the article: they make less, and get promoted less, and somehow don't seem to want any of that.

I disagree on the last part. There's plenty of ambitious, talented women in The Netherlands that do want more, but just don't seem to be able to get there. Sadly, we still have an old boys culture in a lot of companies, as most higher positions are taken up by white men and they're the ones making the decisions. But I'm glad to see that more and more of the bigger companies are becoming aware of this and starting programs to help boost women and minorities within the company. &amp;gt;Interesting.

I obviously don't know your MIL, but for a woman married around that time in the Netherlands, she'd have to have explicitly asked to change her name, or she'd have kept her maiden name. A lot of people get confused by the fact that once married, women are allowed (and in certain circles socially expected) to use their husbands name without further administrative stuff. Did you ever see her passport?

&amp;gt;I disagree on the last part. There's plenty of ambitious, talented women in The Netherlands that do want more, but just don't seem to be able to get there.

 Here you go. One of the conclusions of this study was that Dutch women being less ambitious is a myth.

[Ambitie kent geen tijd](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ru.nl%2Fpublish%2Fpages%2F588045%2Fambitieonderzoek.pdf&amp;amp;ei=vFUiUYzfLOGK0AWc0YEI&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHsjlRpEC4v7VlikZkdZq55NORV7Q&amp;amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.d2k)
 That's actually a really interesting study, but you'll note they explicitly talk about ambition in a very wide sense. In a traditional sense, like you used it to talk about why women don't rise to high positions all that much, "ambition" is about specifically vertical, professional ambition. What this study argues, is that women by and large aren't *less* ambitious, but more *differently* ambitious. And that's a point well taken. Women who work less hours to fulfill ambitions in volunteer work, or sports aren't less ambitious, their ambitions just don't necessarily lie with their careers. But at the same time, if you're wondering why women on average don't reach as far in their careers I'm going to point to that study you posted and remark that for a lot of women, it's not the focus of their ambitions. I'm surprised by you stating that careers are not the focus of women's ambition. I haven't read the whole study today, but the conclusions state that thought women have (slightly) higher social ambitions, there were hardly any differences between men and women's career ambitions (p.127). Could you point out where you found this?

One of the points I found interesting in this study is that people's ideas of gender and stereotypes heavily influenced the perceived ambition of others. That women are taken more serious when they voice ambitions outside of work, but less serious when they're ambitious within the working environment. And that this principle works in the opposite direction for men.

That's why I really like the recommendation for employers to talk to women more about their ambition and the amount of hours they would like to work on a regular basis, as employers were assuming women with children would not be ambitious and/or unwilling to work more. This would work both ways, as employers would be forced to stop assuming, and women would be forced to make a conscious decision about their career choices.  Uhm, I'm afraid your perspective of Dutch society is a little too rosy.

Also, while in theory men and women are equal, we have a ridiculously low percentage of women in high positions.  [deleted] First, 36 hours a week (instead of 40) is considered part-time. But sadly, this only seems to affect women, there's been male politicians in The Netherlands who were prided for taking care of their kids one day a week (like Wouter Bos. Which he still does btw, now that he's a partner at KPMG). In the Netherlands, 36 hours is considered full time. 

Source: I'm Dutch and have a full time job (contract for 100%, but work a lot more than the 36 hours.)  Sorry, but that really depends on the company and the CAO. Some do consider 36 hours a week full time, others 40. Working 4x9 in a 40 hour a week company is part time. 

In my professional experience men with a "pappadag" are celebrated, it's considered great that they take care of their kids one day a week, while women are told working part time will never get them to the top.

Hello, I'm a woman from the Netherlands and I don't love it. Especially not the pay gap. And I'm working on my titles (PhD coming up...). Fuck generalisations.  So, is this article referring to the majority of Dutch women, or just those who are married or who are in committed relationships? What about single women? Are they able to get by on part-time jobs only? Are the majority of Dutch women in stable relationships? 

This article left me with so many questions! So, is this article referring to the majority of Dutch women, or just those who are married or who are in committed relationships? What about single women? Are they able to get by on part-time jobs only? Are the majority of Dutch women in stable relationships? 

This article left me with so many questions!  They work to live, not live to work. It's the way everyone should be living. But of course capitalism would never allow that. Implying that the Netherlands isn't capitalist? Given that it simply isn't true, no.  Then I'm confused, if capitalism wouldn't allow it, yet the Netherlands is a capitalist nation where it clearly does work and is allowed, then the point doesn't hold? My point was that it was the way that everyone should be living. But it isn't, neither there nor anywhere else. There's a sociological term which escapes me for the housework and childrearing that women traditionally do - that's another, similar example of it being beneficial for some people to not be a part of the workforce. As pointed out by someone with a rather different perspective than mine, it's beneficial for a capitalist system for some people not to be working. But as physical labour becomes less and less necessary with the ever rising prominence of automation, the demand for labour is going to fall, and it simply isn't tenable for this 'work 40 hours a week to survive' model to persist because the work won't be there. Too many people would be left jobless and starving. But if people were being paid (hypothetical numbers pulled out of my ass to demonstrate an idea) 4x more an hour and working a quarter of the time, then this problem wouldn't exist. Of course it would cost 4x more in terms of wages, and that's why under capitalism it won't happen. Profit is too important.

Anyway, this is a rather off-topic discussion for 2x. :P They work to live, not live to work. It's the way everyone should be living. But of course capitalism would never allow that. The women do.  Seems like a bum deal for the guys. They work to live, not live to work. It's the way everyone should be living. But of course capitalism would never allow that. I agree with your first assertion, but don't make it a thing against *capitalism*. Capitalism has several flaws that really cater towards live to work.

The primary one is that capitalism is focused on production. The more you produce, the more money you get. Which usually directly translates to the more hours you put in, the better of a chance that you'll get ahead. The most valuable worker in a capitalistic environment is one who can put in the most amount of hours for the least amount of pay. That is exactly what the supply and demand chart dictates. You never want to spend more than what you already have.

In the short term, capitalism can shift in a way where it directly benefits people who have high talent. But in the long term capitalism inevitably fails. The primary and simple reason is that capitalism inherently sends money upward. Remember that supply and demand dictates that you as the owner pay the least amount of money per hour, which means that money goes directly to the person leading projects. This person may at first have a lot of talent and might even deserve every cent he/she gets. You pay more and you give better benefits so you get better employees. That much is true.

But the one thing that people seem to forget about capitalism is that successful people continue to be successful. So whereas your first generation of capitalism is characterized by fierce competition and long hours, your second generation is different. After that first iteration, money gets consolidated within a single group. And after every iteration, this money continues to get consolidated until you get to one person (i.e. a monopoly). The thing that capitalists have to remember is that money is power. If you're a bright guy and you see a risk, what are you going to do when you fail? You've completely lost your prospect, you're now in debt, and now you're poor. But if you're a person who started off with several million dollars, you can take bigger and bigger risks until you achieve. You can spend money to figure out which fields will make you successful.

I often equate capitalism to playing poker. Your first iteration of capitalism is where everyone has the same amount of chips. And for the most part, those chips get passed around. But after every single hand in poker, the money moves from people to people. What happens to the person at the very top? They partake in a strategy called chip bullying, where they can bluff at will, and they can continue to do so until you run out of money. You can't take loss, but they can.

How does this all tie back into basic human rights/hours worked/benefits? Money is power. You will eventually get to a point where you have all the power and for people to receive basic human necessities, they HAVE to work for you. When workers have options that give better benefits and what not, yes there will be better conditions. But when you get to the position where workers do not have an option, you can do what you want. Those workers have no one else they can go to so you're not competing with other people, and those workers cannot start their own company because you can go to financial war with them for longer than they can sustain. 

This is why regulation, max hours worked, benefit requirements are important because they give workers power that they wouldn't otherwise have because they don't start off with money. This is also why it is important that we never trend towards pure capitalism so that small companies are sheltered against larger corporations so that they will eventually be able to compete. All government is bad yes. But all capitalism is bad too. You want to keep the system as close to maybe your third or fourth round of poker as possible so that the little guy can still rise up, and the big guy can't act like that much of a bully. But enough where everyone wants to play.  VERY cogent argument, I applaud you on your political acumen. So much so that it seems like you got this directly from an economics textbook or a theorist. Did you?

I will make several points that assert how and why capitalism is NOT structured in the way you indicate, and that the logical steps you take actually do not translate to the next statement, and your model of capitalism is not applicable to the world.

1) You say in paragraph 4 that the rich will inevitably fail and become poor. But then you continue to say that they will become more and more powerful. Logically, you cannot say that all rich people will inevitably become more powerful. The additional amounts of money a person has are not necessarily 'cushions' for which they can fall back on. People who are rich must spend that money if they want to make money or to maintain that level of wealth. At this high point in monetary use, the proportion of your money that you must use to do this is much higher. Probably equivalent to how much your average man must risk in a similar deal. Investing in a factory is proportionally as risky as investing in a new couch.

2) If you play poorly in poker, you deserve to lose. This is why capitalism is good. While economics and life choices are not nearly so arbitrary as playing poker, they are competitive. The people who make good choices and do well deserve what they earned and therefore, as a necessary by-product, are capable of doing so again, at least within the confines of your limited theory. While I don't agree that this snowballing effect is unequivocally fair and just, it is necessary as a by-product of capitalism. The rest of it's effects are good. Find me a better system of coping with this snowballing effect and money cushioning than what we have already.
 
3) You assert that capitalism will inevitably fail. Find me a capitalistic economy that *certainly* failed. Purely from the state of that system being capitalistic, you cannot find a system that has failed.

4) This is probably the most important part. YOU ARE NEVER FORCED INTO WORKING. You do not have to work for anyone, no matter how much power they have. When nearly all is said and done, the 10 players with 1 chip left can leave the table that has one player with 1,000 chips and find a new table, make their own, or simply exclude him and stop playing altogether. Any entirely monopolistic company/power/person/etc (and I will later get back to this) has no economic power to force all of it's workers to work for it. If the workers fear they are not being properly treated, they can leave and setup their own government, company, union, organization, or collective. 

5) A 100% pure monopoly does not and cannot exist. Among other things, the wide scope of economics and life are too broad for any one company/power/person/etc to control absolutely.
Near-monopolies exist in the forms of, say, the electric companies that provide power to homes and businesses, but they exist in that state for VERY good reason and with plenty of justification. 

6) Why does the "small guy" or "small company" NEED to be GIVEN an unnatural spot in the economic system? This is the principle of communism, which has been more oft proven to be insufficient and detrimental than capitalism ever has. The small firm that is being crushed under the might of a larger firm has not EARNED a spot and there is no reason to give the firm extreme discrimination or favoritism. That, my friend, is what I call economic efficiency. NOT giving people things they don't want. The entrepreneur and the average joe know what they want, and they WILL bid with their feet, wallets, and ideas. Artificially putting in an inefficient and not-necessarily-optimal small firm that has not displayed it's ability to be productive is detrimental to the good of the average, or non-average, person. I agree with your first assertion, but don't make it a thing against *capitalism*. Why not? My feminism is very much informed by my politics. Moreover, what sort of sense does it make for some people to be having to work 60+ hour weeks to survive and yet for there to be tens of millions unemployed? These are two ridiculous extreme sides of the same coin. There could be full employment, no-one would have to be living on government benefits, and everyone could be working shorter hours and actually enjoying their lives. But obviously that would reduce profitability because people would have to be being paid more for working less in terms of (cringe) *man-hours*. Capitalism, the inevitable trickling-up of wealth into the hands of a small number of property and share owners and high-level executives, means that few 'wealth/job creators' would ever debase themselves to the level of having *a normal, healthy income* instead of treating workers like crap, union busting, protesting every minimum wage rise, taking out insurance policies on employees in the hope that they will die, all in the interests of distributing billions more amongst people who had the fortune to have a fortune so they could buy stocks and make a fortune. Your beliefs about how capitalism works are incorrect. Capitalism is something people do, any and all, people do, unless constrained by the bureaucracy of something else (collectivism). Capitalism means individual freedom. People do what they want to do, and get to act however they want to act as an economic player within their system. You don't have to play into anyone's games. People who are the ridiculously wealthy "job creators" are *there for a reason*. Other than givens frpm your birth, wealthy people did their own shit to become wealthy, because that is how capitalism works. There is no reason to "give" those people a "reasonable" income, because you are completely undercutting and undermining the things that they worked for; making it a system of disproportionate wealth gains and losses. 

Communism(a more relatable example)/collectivism(what people actually mean when they say 'communism') of the kind you are talking about just doesn't work. Capitalism works and always will work.

Things like "treating workers" like crap *shouldn't really fly*, but it sometimes does. Why? Because workers, as a whole, don't understand the demand for their efforts, and what they supply. If you are a part-time, minimum-wage earning, useless worker *to a company* then that is YOUR fault that you can't be more worthy. If you don't like how you are being treated, then LEAVE. If you say "I can't leave because no one else will hire me", then that is your OWN FAULT. You aren't worth enough to society to be able to get anything else. The totalitarian businesses that you claim treat workers like crap actually don't. They DO run for profit and their personal gain. *No Shit*. We all do that. Their is no class segregation that is innate to our society, you must earn your healthy and wealthy income and lifestyle. Or don't.

Oh, and "full employment, no-one would have to be living on government benefits, and everyone could be working shorter hours and actually enjoying their lives." is ridiculous and infeasible. 

Full employment is actually a bad thing. Hard to explain without a degree in economics (which I don't have), but a small amount of workers without jobs, who want jobs, is usually good. 

Not living off government benefits is absolutely silly. I can't even broach how off of an idea that is. Consider what you think that means.

And I certainly disagree with "everyone could be working shorter hours", because you can't just magically make people not have to work as hard/as much. If you need things done, they need to get done, one way or another. Unless you can actually find a way to dramatically improve efficiency of regulation, control, contract, and travel, there's no way to let more people work less hours and still have the same work done (benefits to society made, etc).

In conclusion: If you want to be taken advantage of, then sure, work for a company that has those miserable practices for their employees. If you *let* them do that to you, you are worthy of whatever level of cruel treatment they give you. If you let them do that to you, you are worthy of whatever level of cruel treatment they give you. -- "Let them?"  Certainly your understanding of how "letting them" works exactly, on the individual level, is lacking.  A person may decide not to "let them" - and have for choices of alternative work, exactly the same low pay and poor working conditions.  I looked up a nursing assistant course, to get a certificate - cost $1700.  Now maybe I could work and scrape that amount together  - but there are millions of people who don't even have that amount of CAPITAL available to them, even if they WERE working their asses off - and some people CAN'T work like that.  This is one of the problems with CAPITAL-ISM. Exactly. 

Clearly, SOME people can get that certificate. 

You can't.

Why not? You, logically, fucked up at some point in time, and now you are at a worse position. It sucks, but it's a waste of resources to get you back up on your feet (in MANY circumstances, but maybe not ALL or even a MAJORITY of them).

If you want nice things. If you want to be paid a lot. If you want good working hours. Then enter into good contracts with others. Make yourself useful to society (could also be read as "to others" or "to employers".) I went to college with people who fucked up at some point in time. All the time, actually. Getting grades low enough to get kicked out. But their daddies donated to the school, so they didn't get kicked out and eventually scraped by with a C- GPA so they can be next in line to be CEO in the family business (or if they were a real fuckup, just to live off part of the interest of their family's investments).

I also know people who have done "all the right things" and then have investments fall through (because people like Bernie Madoff fucked up in life) or a spouse die while they stayed home doing the family values thing and they were never, ever able to get back up on their feet. 

Capitalism is great if you are born into or somehow make a lot of money. But do not even for a second think that it's everyone's individual "fucking up" that puts them in bad places in life. It's often not a choice, but a combination of factors, all, some, or none of which could be that person's fault. Read about the just-world fallacy (frontpage now on TwoX) to learn more about your bias. Sure, why not? While no one likes it, we are all given a certain amount of social standing and wealth by who we are born from. Being born with living parents and growing up with them means a LOT. Growing up with parents that can pay your way through school is just an inherent perk of whoever you are born to/raised by. You can't change or fix that. I'm sorry that normal people are screwed over, but whether or not they *intended* to do the right thing, they still *did* the wrong thing. Even if that thing was morally right, it could be wrong in that it put them at a detriment: it cost them money or something. We can't go around completely appropriating people into different social positions because misfortune struck them. I'm sorry that some persons wife died and they can't pay for medical bills, but what can you do about it? Surely you can't take wealth from another person and give it to him so he can live like he used to (without their consents)?

It's not a choice, but people will be *naturally* allotted where they are meant to go, and you can't try to fix that. I'm not sure how both of your assertions can be true.

&amp;gt;You, logically, fucked up at some point in time, and now you are at a worse position

/=

&amp;gt;people will be naturally allotted where they are meant to go, and you can't try to fix that.

Actually, you can try to fix it. It's called social democracy, and countries outside the US (in fact, even the yanks give it a go now &amp;amp; then) have been doing it for hundreds of years. Your beliefs about how capitalism works are incorrect. Capitalism is something people do, any and all, people do, unless constrained by the bureaucracy of something else (collectivism).

In conclusion: If you want to be taken advantage of, then sure, work for a company that has those miserable practices for their employees. If you *let* them do that to you, you are worthy of whatever level of cruel treatment they give you. Capitalism means individual freedom - for some, and economic exploitation for many. No, it means you do what you want economically. If you are being exploited, then you have submitted to that oppression. No, it means you do what you want economically. If you are being exploited, then you have submitted to that oppression. While I don't agree with fb_exile that somehow capitalism is to blame for people not having a good work/life balance, saying that being exploited is only and exclusively your own choice (and/or fault) is ridiculously naieve.

Did kids working in a sweatshop making sneakers choose to do that instead of going to school? Often, people are forced by their circumstances to make sub-optimal choices. Circumstances that they may not be responsible for, or may not be able to change easily. Poverty is actually very interesting that way, because being poor is actually surprisingly expensive - making it very hard to work yourself out of being poor.

So a blanket statement of 

&amp;gt; If you are being exploited, then you have submitted to that oppression. 

Is quite frankly delusional. History is full of examples of people being exploited against their will. Your beliefs about how capitalism works are incorrect. Capitalism is something people do, any and all, people do, unless constrained by the bureaucracy of something else (collectivism). Capitalism means individual freedom. People do what they want to do, and get to act however they want to act as an economic player within their system. You don't have to play into anyone's games.

What does it mean to not have a job in the US, in terms of social status, opportunities for advancement, impact on personal relationships and community, etc?  Not good. No one. But I think the oft-cited number is like 3-8%.

Honestly, if you want to understand this, then PLEASE go look up the definition of unemployment, economically. It will help.

And being unemployed for long periods of time is bad. However, economies NEED some unemployment (temporarily for people, BUT since there is a constant influx/outflux of people in that condition, it is seen as a constant level of unemployment on the large scale) to let workers go to new jobs when they open up. If a new sector in technology opens up by a new invention, how will this be exploited if there are NO workers who can work with the invention?

I am not hypothesizing in any way that long term, unyielding, unemployment for a group of people is healthy for that group of people. I am not hypothesizing in any way that long term, unyielding, unemployment for a group of people is healthy for that group of people.  -- but we have that in the US, and have had it in the past.

I agree with your first assertion, but don't make it a thing against *capitalism*. They work to live, not live to work. It's the way everyone should be living. But of course capitalism would never allow that.   This actually doesn't surprise me in anyway. For years women in the US have said that one of the things they would love to have is the ability work part time at a professional job. </snippet></document><document><title>I have a lot of scars and they're making me feel depressed and isolated.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18pno3/i_have_a_lot_of_scars_and_theyre_making_me_feel/</url><snippet>The scars of from self-injury. I've struggled with this on and off for 17 years. Up until recently the only scars visible when I wore a t-shirt were 10-12 years old, very faded and in the process of being tattooed over. I was OK with them because they weren't super noticeable and they could be played off as remnants of a troubled past that I've moved past.

The last year has been really rough for me. I've gone to town on my arms and thighs and I know have large patched of raised, red keloid scars. It will be at least 2 years before the pigmentation fades from these new scars and I can hope to tattoo over them. I've dealt with this issue long enough to know that over the counter creams and scar treatments can do little for large keloid scars and plastic surgery (not that I can afford it or a surgeon would agree to do it for an "active" self-injurer) is not an option for scars grouped together over a large area of skin like mine are.

I've gotten the self injury under control and am receiving psychiatric care, but I'm pretty depressed about "ruining" my body. Every mark is a reminder of my mental illness.  Right now it's winter so I'm okay wearing long sleeved shirts.

But I'm not not looking forward to summer. My naked or swimsuit or T shirt clad body looks violent and sad and ugly. I'm a pretty active person and enjoy hiking, biking, soccer, and skateboarding. These activities are also my primary way of socializing with others. But these are all going to be really uncomfortable to do in long sleeves and pants once the weather gets hotter. I won't give up doing these things completely, but I'm gonna have to do a lot of them solo if I want to do them in a T shirt. Forget about swimming this summer. And that bums me out.

I just can't handle having my casual friends or even close friends seeing these scars. I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to be known as "just a cutter", I don't want to have people worried. The scars are so prominent that they become all consuming. I feel like there's no way to show them that doesn't come across as needy or manipulative too if that makes any sense. Most people won't say anything to me, but I know that they've gossiped about my old scars, I'm positive they'll gossip about my fresh ones. 

I do yoga and meditation at home and I'd love to go to a yoga class but my scars hold me back from that too. There's a lot of body acceptance in the yoga community, but I've found that acceptance can manifest as really harsh judgement against self inflicted violence. 

As shallow as it seems, I don't feel like I can be beautiful now and that's really upsetting too. I just look at a lot of old tops and dresses I have that I really liked and felt good in and all I think is that there's no way I can wear them anymore.

TL;DR: I have self-inflicted scars. They make me feel ugly and hiding them is getting in the way of me doing activities I enjoy and socializing.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to come to peace with my body. I'm also pretty socially awkward and have found it easiest to be around others if we're all doing an activity. I just need a reason to "be there" that isn't just trying to be friendly so I feel less exposed and I have something to focus if socializing gets too overwhelming. I'd love some suggestions for social activities that are less physical.
  I really hope you're able to come to a place where you feel better about your body and your scars. You really should swim and hike this summer, because ultimately I think those things WILL make you feel better and raise your confidence the most. It's going to be scary at first and you'll feel like eyes are on you, but I promise you that you are not ugly nor have you ruined your body. 

One of my friends at college is actually a former-cutter, I believe. I say I believe because, well, that's just one part of her and it's one we haven't discussed.  I've seen the scars on her arms because she wears short-sleeves and the marks on her thighs, and having had friends who cut in the past - I kind of assume.  Nobody gossips about them at all (and believe me, I'm friends with a lotta chatterboxes) , and she's widely adored in our year. She's a sweetheart, and gorgeous.  She was one of the girls who several boys had crushes on right out of the box, and yes, they saw her scars too. Nobody sees sad or ugly or violent. Okay? Nobody. 

Oh, there could and might be assholes down the line I'm sure - I have some medical scarring on my upper chest, and every now and then I get awkward questions or stares. Yeah, a rude comment here or there.  Most people don't really care, or if they're curious it's just because they want to get to know me better . Please please please don't limit your enjoyment of your life because of your scars. You shouldn't be ashamed of your journey and what it took to get you to where you are.  Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of, it affects more people than you'd think - some people's scars aren't physical, that's all. Think of how far you've come when you see those scars, think of how much you're working and how well you're doing - even when you slip up, I'm sure you're in a different place then before. 

I hope this doesn't come across as lecturing, and I'll answer your question even my biggest hope for you is to go swimming this summer. If you really do want something less physical to keep involved, you could always volunteer. It sounds simple, but I've met so many wonderful people and it makes me feel so good to be needed and helpful.   Good luck, babe.

It sounds simple, but I've met so many wonderful people and it makes me feel so good to be needed and helpful.   Good luck, babe.  sometimes i really wonder how they look to other people. i see them as so much pain and anger. how can anyone else actually accept them? When I first see someone's cutting scars, I admittedly feel empathy/sympathy because I can tell they've been through/struggled with something or still are. While self-harm isn't something I have had to personally deal with, I've dealt with depression for years. Now, I don't want you to think I super pity or concentrate on it or anything. It's just like; "Oh, s/he must have cut." It's similar for me at least to finding out someone is on anti-depressants or seeing a therapist. It's just part of - I don't know - them. I will probably be more worried if they seem to be having lots of off days, because I know how easy it can be to slip into those kind of thinking patterns and that's true of any of my friends that have struggled with mental health in the past.

They don't read as pain and anger for me because - well, it's not my pain or anger. It's like, imagine you have a friend with a scar across their nose - for them it's a reminder of a bad car accident when they see it in the mirror. But for you? That's just how their face looks. In the beginning you may notice it more because it's different and you can tell it's a scar, but then it just - idk - part of the person.  Own it. Scars show us where we've been, not where we are. You're not a cutter. You *were* a cutter. You are stronger because you went through something, but you came through it. 

I have a co-worker with some pretty serious scars on her wrists. When I see them, I see a powerful person who came through a serious disease. I would hope that people would see the same in you. I know I would. [deleted]  I have a lot of scars, too. They aren't that prominent anymore, though. I use to feel really self-conscious about showing them, but I really think it's going to be a matter of accepting that they're a part of you now. Are you into tattoos at all? I know a lot of people that have tattooed over theirs with really beautiful artwork.

http://dragonflyink.com/custom-tattooing/scar-tattooing/frequently-asked-questions-about-tattooing-over-scars/  I have lots of scars, too.  It's embarrassing and dehumanizing when people stare, I know firsthand.  But you shouldn't be ashamed of them.  Sure, it's not something to be *proud* of, but there's no reason why you should be ashamed for having those scars.  While every scar is a reminder of your struggles, it's also a reminder that *you're still alive*, and that's a pretty kickass thing to be.

To the best of my knowledge, I've heard that it's not a good idea to tattoo over keloid scars, because it's not the same as other scars.  You run the risk of distorting your tattoos.  This is the reason why you cannot get a tattoo touched up tons of times, after a while the scar tissue basically becomes mush and the design becomes a little wonky, and the process of tattooing over keloid scars is a bit tedious.

If someone stares at your scars, say, "Didn't your mother teach you that it was rude to stare?"  If someone asks, tell them to mind their own business or that you don't want to talk about it.  They are not entitled to a conversation on your appearance and your past, and you *are* entitled to your privacy.

I haven't tried it myself, but Dermablend makes foundation/concealer that covers tattoos (so it could probably also cover scars), and it's waterproof.  It comes in a ton of different shades, so you could probably find one to match your skin tone.  If you have any kind of make up shop like Sephora in your area, it would help to go to the store and look at your color options and try to find a good match.  I've heard really great things about it, so it's worth a shot!

EDIT: I've heard that there are also laser treatments to take care of scars. Hi, thanks for your reply. I realized my original post could have come off as insensitive to others with similar scars. You're right, self-injury scars are nothing to be ashamed of.  I have lots of scars, too.  It's embarrassing and dehumanizing when people stare, I know firsthand.

EDIT: I've heard that there are also laser treatments to take care of scars. tattooing over keloid scars can result in blurry lines. but i kinda like it. :)   some days i look at my arms and i just wonder what it would be like to be normal and have smooth arms and legs with no reason to have to wear long sleeves or pants always. 

to an extent i've given up caring. the scars on my forearms are light enough and somewhat tattooed over that they're not very noticeable, so it's hard to tell they're there. i still wear long capris to cover up my legs though, as they're darker keloids. 

the self-harm is something i accept about me, and i've been free of it for a couple of years? now. i think about it almost every day, but have been on a better combination of meds lately, so i haven't felt that need to actually do anything. i've never really caught anyone staring, but once in a while people will ask. 

i second looking into Dermablend or other makeup, just to cover up the redness. but mostly, just don't let it worry you. and try to go without hurting yourself. :)   I agree, just own them. Its your story. 

I have a huge scar that runs from my pubic bone to my breastbone. The incision came open around my belly button and it didnt heal nicely at all. And I have a circular scar to the left of my belly button about 2 inches wide from an colostomy I once had. I used to be ashamed, and now I actually wear a bikini when I swim. They're mine, and the story made me who I am today. 

I have a little girl now, and I like to show her that nobody is perfect, and you dont have to hide yourself if you dont want to.  Thank you for your reply. It's good to hear about people who've gotten comfortable enough in their own skin. I believe scars like yours can add distinctive beauty precisely because of the story they tell. I've gotta admit, a lot of my shame has to do with the story behind my scars.   I have self harm scars on my left forearm. Theres words written on there, so its super obvious i did it myself. My family and friends all know i have them, and dont care. Of course, I havent done this since i was 15, so its a bit different from your situation. I hide them from my super conservative godmother, and during job interviews. As for how you come to peace with your body, well, stop looking at it so negatively. That is only going to depress you more and harness the feelings that made you self harm in the first place.   Everyone else has said it - scars are a symbol of what you've been through. If you are moving on from where you were, and you've obviously considered your options for hiding/removing your scars, try to make peace with yourself.

If other people want to judge you based on a tiny portion of your whole life, let them; they aren't worth the worry. If I saw someone covered with scars, I would assume they'd come from a bad place, and hope that they were on their way to a better one. Of course, this doesn't mean you need to go running around in singlets and miniskirts, attacking anyone who take a second look; just explain to anyone who asks that you went through a rough time, and have the scars to prove it.

GOOD LUCK and I HOPE YOUR FRIENDS ARE REAL FRIENDS  I've also been self harming since I was about 11 years old. I'm in counseling now, and like you, I'm receiving help, but there is a part of me that is so full of regret because my body will never be the same again. 

There are some very prominent, thick, raised scars on my left arm that people ask me about all the time. I tell people I was in a car accident, which is partly true (one scar is actually from a car accident I was in when I was six). But the lie never gets easier to tell, and even though these scars are from over six years ago, the little jolt of panic in my chest when other people acknowledge their existence never really gets any softer. And those are just the ones on my arms. The worst are my legs; both outer thighs at this point basically look like a pissed off cat and I got locked in the same pitch black room for 24 hours.

I guess I don't really have a lot of advice for you, but I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone. I love you, anonymous internet person. Be strong. (:   So that's what those scars are called! I have a keloid scar on my upper arm from my cutting days and I never knew what they were called. The more you know and all that. What I can share with you is my experience and that over time I just find I care less what other people think. I haven't cut or done any self-injury in 5 years, am in a much healthier mental space now and at a place where I see the scars as reminders of who I was not who I am now.

My scars aren't very visible but in the few times people have asked I either lied if I just didn't feel like going into all that or didn't think they would respond kindly or I have just told them to truth. A lot of people have struggled with and continue to struggle with self injury. If not cutting than some other form so in a few instances friends have disclosed their own experiences after I shared mine. Don't really have much to say for advice except for me time was a big factor as well as taking the stigma out of the situation. Yeah, keloids kinda suck, mostly for me because they itch like crazy even months after healing. I know one's propensity to getting them is genetic, but your upper arms, chest, and ribcage are prone to forming keloids the most. 

I'm happy to hear you've been cut-free for 5 years! That's great! thank you for your reply and best of luck to you!  Self injury can be so common I really think we need to accept scars more. I've seen many a person with old self-inflicted scars. and all I think is that they are brave and clearly doing much better now. I never think less of these people.  When my scars were red and angry, I used to use [this stuff](http://compare.ebay.co.uk/like/330836692441?var=lv&amp;amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;amp;var=sbar&amp;amp;adtype=pla&amp;amp;crdt=0) to make them less noticeable;it's pretty hard wearing. The only other thing I can advise you to do is to try and accept your scars. I know this is way easier said than done, but that's what I realised I had to do in the end. I wish you all the best in your recovery!   i'm right there with you. i've been a cutter since i was 14 (i'm 21 now). i still cut, but not nearly as much thanks to an awesome boyfriend. i hate my scars. i have them on my arms, my thighs, on the top of my boobs/chest.

what's weird is that i love my boyfriends' scars. he has a toooon, because he used to be a drug dealer (cocaine.. the really bad stuff) and i guess a gang member. he was the person who scared people, roughed them up when they wouldn't pay. he's been stabbed a couple times. he also self harmed. his scars, to me, are beautiful and they actually kind of turn me on during sex. but i *hate* mine.

you are not alone. Thank you for your reply. I'm glad to hear you have a supportive boyfriend who's helping you out. I hope we can both can make peace with our scars.

I hope your boyfriend is OK now. I couldn't handle having a boyfriend who's lifestyle put him in constant danger of getting stabbed or killed--I'd be way to freaked out :( . Good luck to both of you.</snippet></document><document><title>Embarrassed at my own behavior, anyone else have good stories to share?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18pqf5/embarrassed_at_my_own_behavior_anyone_else_have/</url><snippet>Friday night we had a small party at my department in grad school and we started drinking around 3:30 or so with the professors, and then continued long after they went home. It was a typical night out, our numbers ranged from half a dozen to about ten throughout the night. We drank all the booze at the department, then grabbed a late dinner, then bar hopped for the rest of the night. 

Normally I'm really in control of myself and remain aware of everything, but I'm not sure what happened on Friday. As soon as we were done eating I was crashing, hard. I hadn't had more to drink than anyone else, and in fact I thought I had paced myself really well earlier in the afternoon. But my memory for the rest of the night is just odd snippets like old polaroids of where I was. If I was more aware I would have taken myself home but I wasn't and so I was dragged along for another couple hours getting drinks pressed into my hands. Ended up making out with a guy in our department that I have no romantic interest in and just generally being sloppy and obnoxious. I was completely unaware of my surroundings, and next thing I know I wake up on my friend's couch after she refused to let me go home and sleep it off alone. 

I just can't believe I allowed myself to get to that point; I've never been so smashed in my life and this wasn't a night I would have chosen to get black-out drunk. Being out of control sucked, and I just feel really disappointed in myself for not being smarter. I stayed in all day yesterday licking my wounds and nursing the worse hangover of my life, but I seriously don't want to go to class and see anybody this week. 

So cheer me up TwoX? I know I was bad, but does anyone have similar stories? Tips for never getting out of control like that again?  I vaguely recall waking up in the middle of night, crawling (yes, crawling) out of the tent and yakking on the banks of the Rappahannock River.

I also had to nurse my first hang-over at a large company meeting. But it was okay, because all of my co-workers were in the same boat, including the VP and Pres. (My company knows how to party.) That was fun because I think I was dancing earlier that night. and one of our out-of-town co-workers had his shirt off.

At the next company meeting, I interspersed drinks with glasses of water, and that definitely helped me avoid a hang-over. Plus it helped me pace myself and I was able to call it a night when I realized I needed to.

 Your workplace sounds a lot like my department. It's a cold winter here right now, but last semester when the weather was warmer we'd have parties like this every two or three weeks. Maybe it's because it's been so long that I went down so easy...  Sometimes when I'm drunk I tend to think places that aren't the toilet are, indeed, the toilet. I found this out when my old roommate told me about the time he had to stop me from peeing in his closet. And another night I threw up in my dresser drawer. That drawer is the same height as a toilet so after those two incidents I realized that I was pretty sure drunk me thought I was in the bathroom and "flipped open the lid" (meaning pulled out the drawer) and threw up into what I thought was an appropriate place. My awesome roommate cleaned up after me (I had gone through a breakup that very day which was why we were out drinking in the first place) and I will forever be grateful.  I overindulged on blue curacao one night. I had eaten beef stroganoff earlier. I was staying with some friends at the time, and I turned their sink blue and chunky. :(   Shortly after I started my current job, my company had a giant party with an open bar, free cab rides home... so I got a healthy buzz on. One of my new coworkers invited me to go downtown after the party was over, I had a few more drinks because I wasn't driving, and next thing I know I'm making out with my new coworker in a bar. Not my finest moment. He was totally cool about it though... never told anyone at the office what a drunken idiot I was, and we're pretty good friends now.

Not my worst story, actually. A few years ago I was at a party, and earlier that day I had gotten some really awful news about my pain condition (vulvar vestibulitis). I was feeling pretty broken, got WAY too drunk, and ended up sobbing and telling everyone in earshot about my broken vagina. I was beyond embarrassed the next day. Actually haven't ever hung out with any of those people again, LOL.

Don't stress it, things happen. You live and you learn, right?

  I used to be what I like to call a complete mess. Every weekend I would get shit faced drunk and something like this would happen.  Here are a few delightful examples of me being a dick:

* Waking up covered in bruises to be informed that I fell outside/inside the club in front of everyone, and then burst into tears and disappeared into the night, somehow finding my way home. This happened more than once.

* Throwing up *all over* a friend's bathroom then passing out in it with the door locked, annoying everyone.

* Being so drunk that, when 'dancing,' I knocked most of the people on the dancefloor over and just made an ass of myself in general.

* Starting a fight because someone said something shitty about my boyfriend.


* Passing out in the middle of a party... like, right in the middle of the main room. 


* Breaking down in tears most weekends because I knew I was a drunk but it is hard to stop being one. Telling people I had just met my various problems. Even worse, telling my family one night. 


* Realising that I had no recollection of most of my nights out. A lot of the stuff that I must have done, I don't remember as I never asked my friends because I was too ashamed. 
 
My tips are to pace yourself; don't slam back drinks like a butt. Shots are fun and cheap, but they can turn you from a happy drunk into a messy asshole very quickly. 

Eat something before you go out and drink water as much as you can while out.

Don't drink spirits; at least for me, drinks like cider and beer are harder to drink too much of, if that makes sense. And they make you feel sick if you drink too much too fast, which is good if you are trying to pace yourself. 

 If you are at a bar, try to take enough cash so that you won't end up emptying your bank account by using your cards and not really noticing how much you're spending.


Finally, don't try to drink yourself into a different person. Alcohol can give you confidence, but it can also turn you into a dire shitbag. I learned this way too late, but it is true.  So I am very involved on campus, and this is pretty rare for some one in a science program and as a result, there is 1 faculty member that I interact with near *daily*.

Last friday, one of the groups I am involved in held an event. It took a lot of prep for us, and honestly we were all glad when it was over. But to celebrate, I went out for drinks at the campus pub with friends! But just a little while later, a few of the people I work with showed up....

PRO-TIP: Just because you're drunk and someone asks you about your sex life, doesn't mean you have to answer the question. The one person that is technically my boss, also the head of the undergrad lab department,  and involved with 2 of the groups I work with now knows that I have loud sex. Oh that is *awesome*. I'm generalizing here too because of the science major, but I'm guessing female students in your program are a bit of a rarity? Bet that made it even worse... Medical Physics! Actually, I'm pretty lucky, there's a pretty good amount of girls in my major!

Nothing like the statistics in biology but we have about 12 girls in a class of 38. 

Ahaha he's a pretty cool guy! He made a joke out of it, but I of course was still totally mortified.  You've still got me beat, that's awful.

I have a tendency to throw up over balcony railings. My "favorite" incident was my freshman year of college and we had been shooting jello shots all night. I ran outside and threw up... and it landed on the all the people standing in the back yard. I blacked out later that night, and I woke up in my dorm room with one of my friends sleeping next to me. He slept over so I didn't vomit and choke in my sleep. Super embarrassing.   This is the story of the first time I got throw up drunk.

I was meeting up with some old friends and some new friends at a local hangout. One of those new friends had a voucher for $100 worth of drinks at this bar. We knew the bartender so that $100 stretched quite a long way. This is also the first night I discovered tequila shots.
Anyways, after getting pretty sloshed, a few of us decide to move on to a club. We decided to meet another friend at our chosen club and head out on our way. Now, I'm the most drunk (and pretty far gone) but my two friends I was with were also pretty drunk. It was the blind leading the blind. Because of this we ended up in a completely different club. I started crying and we were freaking out. Thankfully the friend we were meeting found us and dragged us back to the club where we were supposed to be.

We're finally in the right place and someone decided to shout us some shots. I shouldn't have done it, I was barely with it, yet my yells of "NO GUYS REALLY, I CAN TAKE IT. TRUST ME. WHERE'S THE SALT?" was enough to convince my equally drunk friends that it was all good.
It wasn't all good.
So I was swaying on the dance floor (the only one dancing I think) and it hits me. I had to lay down forever. So I stumble over to these closed off seat areas. There were already people in there I think. I suddenly get super nauseous and proceed to hurl onto the floor. Some staff kicked me out. 
So the two friends that came to the club and I head over to a pie place, where I puked again (outside though, I have dignity). Someone high fived me and we decided to head off to the apartment one of my friends was staying at. 
We catch a cab, however we had to get out halfway home because I needed to puke again. We walked the rest of the way. When we got there I passed out on the couch holding a jug to my face. 

The next morning I woke up at 6am and caught the train home. It was the worst time I've had on public transport ever.   I got drunk at an Easter Lunch with my Dad's ( shitty and holier then thou) side of the family, and had to sleep it off in the back of my Dad's car. We had to stop at a public park restroom halfway home so I could unleash a hellish wave of [grogbog](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grog%20bog). 

The next few days were full of 'keep her away from the alcohol' jokes and my Dad was pretty angry and embarrassed, but my sister thought it was incredibly funny so I suppose that's all that counts.

 God I would love to get trashed and say some choice things to my shitty and holier then thou side of the family, good for you.   I was in the Navy, oh yes, I have stories.  A couple highlights from 4th of July weekend, stationed in Great Lakes.  Began drinking at 8 AM, polished off a bottle of rum by noon.  We all decided to drive to Milwaukee, I think we had a fairly  sober driver.  Got a room, went to the Safe House and proceeded to get trashed.  I threw up in a McDonald's parking lot, into the back bumper of a very beautifully restored 1950's Buick.  I was aiming for the bushes.  

The we went to RHPS.  I had the newspaper to go over my head during the rain scene, but no lighter for "There's a Light".  So I rolled up the paper and lit it off the lighter being held up next to me.  TORCH!!!!  Luckily my buddies grabbed it and stomped it out before the ushers could get to us and toss us out.

Drinking tip: eat first, something with enough grease to coat your stomach lining.  Have a drink of water between each alcoholic beverage, and get up often.  Sitting down, you can't tell how hammered you're getting.  If you have a designated driver, have them be a drinker minder too, cutting you off before things get ridiculous or dangerous.      When I was twenty two I lived in the deep south selling furniture and y sister invited me as her date for her company Christmas party. She told me there would be free food and an open bar. When you're 22 and broke this sounds awesome. And it would have been...if there had actually been food to go along with the copious amounts of alcohol.

Not having anything to say to the room full of engineers I decided to talk to the staff behind the bar who were happy to indulge my top shelf curiosities. I started to tease and flirt with the shy engineers, even the ones with the wives across the room. I decided I had to meet EVERYONE at this party. I danced...when there wasn't any music.

Eventually my sister had enough and took me home. I had forgotten my sister had been driving a large pick up for a few years and face planted on the asphalt. With blood dripping down my face I managed to enter my apartment with my sister yelling after me to not get blood on my white dress.

I wish that was the end...

But I had to attend a wedding the next day which happened to have half of the guests from the prior night in attendance. I tried to cover up the gashes on my face with makeup but to no avail. My sister's boss came up to me with his wife and introduced me. She raises her eyebrows and says, "Oh you're Vonnegutgal!" I blushed through the paste on my face only for her husband to lean over and say "Don't worry, someone has to be the life of the party." Mortified. 

  I have a ton of stories but generally I have more than a few close friends tell me I'm extremely obnoxious when I drink. I mostly start knocking shit over(including myself) and start yelling at people or get really affectionate. yeah.... I don't drink as much anymore but I wish I could find a single story but they all blur together and all are horrible. As someone who flirts with alcoholism the only advice I can give you for staying in control is to buy a really expensive nice drink and sip on that so you don't go crazy. Don't ever feel pressure to keep up- you'll thank yourself, your friends will thank you and everyone else around you will thank you lol.

edit: I do have a story! it involved me losing my only set of  car keys and having to pay around 400$ for a tow/checkup/car keys :( and having to go to work that next day extremely hungover and feeling like shit as well as broke as hell. </snippet></document><document><title>Adoptive mom's 'newborn' photo shoot with 13-year-old son [x-post: adoption]</title><url>http://www.today.com/moms/adoptive-moms-newborn-photo-shoot-13-year-old-son-goes-1C8347362</url><snippet>  This is fantastic! I love the idea. I also like that they adopted older children. I'm not a fan of the baby stage, and tend to get along better with older kids. Especially because non newborns are often hard to get out of the system once they stop being a cute little baby. It's less about cuteness and more about bonding issues and missing out during critical developmental periods. Never underestimate the power of the cuteness factor. I am an adoptive mom of an older kid, and while there are certainly some older kids in the system who are deeply damaged, adoptive parents seem incredibly willing to overlook the unknowable level of damage in an abused/neglected infant or toddler, and incredibly unwilling to assess the knowable level of damage than an older child has taken. I really think that the "snuggly puppy" aspect has a huge psychological impact on potential adoptive parents. People will take a drug-exposed newborn over a kid who has witnessed drug use by adults, but is old enough that it's obvious his/her own brain has not been addled by drug exposure. It befuddles me. I am very, very glad that people are willing to adopt babies, and I recognize that giving birth also lands you with a completely unknown quantity in terms of future behaviors and medical conditions - but I wish that more people could see past the cute factor and appreciate the benefits of being able to TALK to the child you are thinking about adding to your family.

Honestly - How many 13-year old boys have the sense of humor to go along with something like this? What a lucky family to have all found each other :) I thought it was going to be weird, but it sounds like it was mostly motivated by his own interest. What a good natured kid.

but the article and the story behind the adoption is awesome. such a simple and sweet wish, to have baby pictures My parents adopted my younger brother when he was 18.  He was my sister's friend and his Mom had just died of cancer and he had no other family.  So my Mom just had him move into my old room.  He's a great kid.  But every once in a while my Mom will make him do silly things and take photos.  Like wear footie pajamas or get a sticker after a visit to the doctor.  She thinks it's hilarious and he doesn't mind because he loves my parents.   My parents adopted my younger brother when he was 18.

The photos of a 13 year old boy dressed as a baby are on the internet for his peers and teachers to see. 

Why don't you just send him to school with a sign that says "please kick my ass". Sometimes parents need to get over their need for parental validation and actually consider how what they do impacts the child.   The story doesn't change anything. This is weird.

Sometimes parents need to get over their need for parental validation and actually consider how what they do impacts the child.      I absolutely love this  I absolutely love this    I adopted 3 kids from foster care 3.5 years ago and I wish I had thought of this! The kids get upset at times that there are no baby pictures and that we don't know what they looked like.  It especially comes up when they have those school games where they match baby photos with current photos. 

Also, ITT a lot of folks are talking about him getting bullied. One of the surprises I got is that my kids have never been bullied for being adopted. They do get picked on for other things, but their past and parentage never come up. I figured it would be at the top of the list of bully fodder but the other kids really don't give a damn.     I love this. It is a great idea and really touching. [deleted]                   Didn't we see this twice in one day, just last week? Didn't we see this twice in one day, just last week? You may have, but I didn't.  A lot of people saw it.

http://i.imgur.com/HGy6L6C.jpg I'm only subscribed to one of those.   Welllll I'm forecasting some really embarrassing moments for him later on/now that it's been picked up by a major media outlet. Somehow, I don't think he gives a shit now, nor will he ever.   What makes you say that? Do you think a 13 year old boy would do this against his will?  ANY teenager?  He clearly has a killer sense of humor, and he wanted to participate.  Plus, these pictures symbolize him officially having his "own" family.  He will treasure these memories, and anyone who tries to shame him in any way for them will probably get put in their place.  

SOURCE:  Adopted kid I dunno, I think lots of people do things at thirteen that kind of make them  cringe a bit later in life, and this would probably be something that would do it for me.  Granted, for such an unusual thing, it is tastefully done, but still, do you think that all the 13 year old kids who see this and know him would be able to handle it maturely? And if they don't, I imagine it being embarrassing for him. Most people (teenagers especially) can't just shrug off others nastiness as being no big deal.

And if they don't, I imagine it being embarrassing for him. Most people (teenagers especially) can't just shrug off others nastiness as being no big deal. Anyone who would tease or otherwise harass someone for something like this needs help.  I suspect that most kids will think its funny, because it genuinely is.  And that will make the asshats who think its cool to rag on him about it much easier to deal with.  

The symbolism of the pictures is way bigger than anything anyone could say anyway.  He has a FAMILY now.  A family that chose HIM, out of all the cute babies they might have chosen, they chose HIM.  That will also make things easier to shrug off. Whether they need help or they're just assholes, kids tease and harass people for things like being fat or gay all the time, and both of those are way more common than something like this.

I'm not judging him or anything, I'm just saying that it probably wasn't the best thing for his mom to post to her Facebook wall. It doesn't sound like you have any experience with the foster system.

By a fairly young age kids are already starting to become pretty bulletproof. By the time they reach their teens their defense mechanisms are pretty well honed. Comparing what they've been though in the system to getting crap over some pictures that they like, and are most likely going to place a great deal of importance on, due to the family support they now have, is night and day.

What this family appears to be ready to give them is what system kids dream about. And this is coming at a point where they have probably given up any hope of it happening. They leave the system when they turn 18 and have nothing. This is like winning the lottery to them, if it sticks. So what you're saying is that I should be sure to make a note that I can get away with doing way more creepy/weird/stupid things if I adopt an older kid out of the foster system because they will feel so lucky to be a part of my family (and others will still praise me for it, evidently). Whether they need help or they're just assholes, kids tease and harass people for things like being fat or gay all the time, and both of those are way more common than something like this.

My brother's upcoming wedding will be my first.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qbcl/im_27_years_old_and_ive_never_been_to_a_wedding/</url><snippet>I figured I'd share here since you guys tend to have really great insight on these kinds of issues, and because I'm really embarrassed about this. But yeah, I've never been to a wedding before. None of my close friends have gotten married, I'm the 2nd oldest of all the cousins in my family and none of them have gotten married, I haven't been to any other family or friend's weddings either because I just don't know people or haven't been invited or some combination of the two. I've never been asked to be someone's date to a wedding.

I originally didn't think much of this until playing the "never have I ever" drinking game with friends; You say something you haven't done in order to get someone to admit to something embarrassing they've done, or to get everyone to drink if it's a common thing. I told people I've never been to a wedding, and I got some very weird looks, and a lot of questions. I might as well have said "I've never made a friend before."

So my brother is getting married at the end of the year, and on top of that my future sister-in-law has asked me to be a brides maid. I don't even know what that entails other than standing near the front and wearing matching dresses! I don't know what all goes into a wedding other than what I've overheard from others' conversations for planning them. I'm single now, and have been for several years now (I date, but nothing has stuck long-term)...do I need to find a date for this? Is it okay if I go single?

Already today I went on a tour of the venue with my parents and had lunch with my brother and his fiance and I didn't want to say anything or ask any questions for fear of looking like some outcast weirdo or idiot. I don't think my parents even know I've never been to a wedding, I'm sure they assume maybe a pal got married while I was in college or over the past several years living on my own and it was just a passing thing one weekend I never told anyone about.

How should I feel about this? Is it normal to have never been to a wedding at so old? I feel like maybe I've failed in making enough friends... I've always been kinda solitary; I'm very kind and social and I'm not afraid of people or attending parties, and I do know a lot of people, but my close close friends are very few and far between. And now with my brother getting married and me having been single for so long I feel like I'm failing in that, too.

Weddings and dating and having BFFs have never been important to me; I've focused on weathering the Recession and getting my career off the ground, improving the talents I have, traveling whenever I can and making friends all over the US. Not that weddings are exclusively for "girly" girls, but at least growing up they had that association, and I just never picked up on their importance.

Sorry for being ranty. This has been on my mind for a while but now that I'm being asked to be a bride's maid I'm just realizing how in the dark I am about all this and how embarrassed I feel.       </snippet></document><document><title>Melissa DeTora becomes the first woman to make it to the top 8 in a Magic: the Gathering Pro Tournament!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ogf2/melissa_detora_becomes_the_first_woman_to_make_it/</url><snippet>She played insanely well on Day 1 of the tournament, coming in first overall that day.

History in the making! :D
  Why is it guys flip when they find out I play MTG? 
My first thought is usually "Hey! We have a hobby that we can share (and you can totally with rebuilding my deck)"
Maybe it's just the guys i meet &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; It's the guys you meet. I haven't played in years, but when I did there wasn't much flap over it, even when I was the only girl around.

Then again, maybe those guys were playing it cool on the outside and flipping on the inside, I dunno ;) When I'm playing at someone's house it's usually no big deal. Like, people are a bit nicer to me than I think they would be to a guy but that's all. But when I play at a shop there's often a few males (of widely varying ages) who can't seem to hide their astonishment/dismay/excitement/etc.  When I'm playing at someone's house it's usually no big deal. Like, people are a bit nicer to me than I think they would be to a guy but that's all. But when I play at a shop there's often a few males (of widely varying ages) who can't seem to hide their astonishment/dismay/excitement/etc.  I may be able to provide some useful commentary on this subject. I used to play some MTG but concentrated more on Warhammer 40K. Those shops are a safe place for those guys, I never suffered very much for my nerdy hobby but I knew a lot of guys who did. Mercilessly made fun of at school during lunches for going over their D&amp;amp;D profiles, people spilling their die everywhere, you get the picture.

So going to these shops to be with their friends who didn't judge them or make fun of them was an important activity and it was protected as such. A girl there could mean a lot of things, if she was known to the group then it was fine, but most of these guys did not do very well with girls their age so they didn't know to how to handle it and it made them nervous when one interloped into "their" shop, she jeopardized the safe space.

I kinda liken it to a man being at an abortion clinic, it's not wrong that he's there, but there are some women who are uncomfortable in that context with a male around. Same with these guys, this is their safe place and a girl entering it makes them a bit uneasy until they know why she's there and become familiar with her.

 I can see that. The problem is that their safe space has cool hobbies while ours, according to your metaphor, just has abortions?? 

Though the problem for me was usually not hostility. It was much more likely to be overwhelmingly annoying condescension. Also a problem of lack of exposure to women I think.  I was just making a comparison just to flesh out my point, my example was just the first place that popped into my head where a man's presence might make women uncomfortable. Maybe it'd be a similar uncomfortable feeling for some women if an obviously straight man walked into an all woman's yoga class? 

I also wasn't trying to defend any rude behavior, just try to shed some light on perhaps what is possibly motivating the behavior. Condescension is a really common tactic to take when your in group feels threatened, it bars the person you're being condescending towards from entering the group even if you're trying because you're, "not worthy".

Then again, maybe those guys were playing it cool on the outside and flipping on the inside, I dunno ;) Depends on the guy. No shortage of the guys who play (I hate to stereotype, but some of those well above the age of majority were still boys, at least in this regard) are of the attitude that this is a "no girlz allows" club. 

Gods. I can't wait to see their reaction when I come back into the scene.  Go back with a VENGEANCE! Big thing stopping me from playing me at the moment is that I'm trans, and in transition. Everything connected with that - the meds, the doc visits, hair removal, document updates... it's scarfing my spare cash. 

Next block, when I'm further along, definitely.  Why is it guys flip when they find out I play MTG?

Maybe it's just the guys i meet &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; I mentioned MTG on a first date one time (risky) and he turned out to be MTG world champion Jon Finkel. Who knew?!

I mentioned MTG on a first date one time (risky) and he turned out to be MTG world champion Jon Finkel. Who knew?! How did you YOU not know who he was? Haha I play the game, but don't know the pros.

Maybe it's just the guys i meet &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; I have tried to teach my girlfriends MTG countless times and never once have they ever enjoyed it. A buddy and his fiance both play and I have never been more jealous, if you are going to spend your life with someone they better understand the beauty of Jund. I feel your pain. My husband has shown interest, but he's so bad at it that I end up beating him, which makes him hate the game. Sigh. Yeah, my friend has discovered the best way to start out is making a bunch of mono-colored pauper decks, it levels the playing field. I'm a newbie but my boyfriend (who has been playing on and off for like a decade) uses his normal decks on me :( 

Is there anyplace online for learning strategies and deck building stuff, that's beginner-friendly?  Try /r/magicTCG they posted some learning stuff the other day.

What format does your boyfriend play? Standard, EDH, Modern?

Depending on the format, I can give you simple tips. That refers to the sets used in play, right? (Had to google, don't think I've even heard of formats before. My gameplay experience has been *very* casual.)

I think he just uses whatever, including old and new cards. I have a 2013 core set deckbuilder toolkit (I believe that's the correct name anyway), a few misc. old things the boyfriend hand-me-down-ed, and a bunch of Return to Ravnica booster packs.

Maybe it's just the guys i meet &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; Flip in what sense? spaz, or get weirded out. They just can't figure why i would play it.   Sounds awesome, I wish I had time to learn how to play. If you go to a game shop, they should be willing to teach. After all, cardboard crack equals money :) 

Also, if you have a Windows computer, you can download the online version of the game to learn the fundamentals for free. More than that has a price tag, but if you learn the basics, learning everything beyond the basics doesn't take much more.

I ordered my Mirena and have to go when Shark Week starts.

Dudes, I am SO AFRAID. I have the LOWEST threshold for pain and more other issues. One is that across 18 hours of labor with gallons of pitocin, I did. Not. Dilate. My mom has a weird cervix and I can only imagine I inherited it. Thanks mom!

Still more! I am a perfectly healthy person but I am being treated for ADHD and anxiety. I have GAD, but increasingly worse anxiety in medical situations. I have to get knocked out for dental procedures and I think because of what I experienced in labor (catheter without anesthesia or pain meds, internal monitor) I am a bit traumatized. When someone comes at me with a needle I become lizard brain chick. 

Also, over the summer, I had a panic attack at the GP because the PA was hostile to me, and examined me in a hostile way. 

Sorry I am pouring out my feels you guys. Anyway, HBC is not something I tolerate well, and I smoke. I can stop smoking. But I do smoke. And I am 33 and have probably all the kids I want. 

So this is the sensical move. BUT, my OB-GYN won't discuss pain or anxiety management and I think this is going to be a big deal. No OBs will, and PP doesn't take my insurance, even if they DID discuss it.

I spoke with my Psychiatrist (who I see for ADHD/anxiety) and he agrees that this is something necessary. He said if it were any other situation, like if I was phobic about planes, he would be able to prescribe things for me. But given it is a medical procedure, he can't go over another doctor's head.

The PA at by OBGYN is great. And she admits insertion is excruciating. And she agrees that there is no pain management with IUDs, and it's ridiculous. She even says that her dad was a urologist, and that there was a procedure they do that is equally painful for men and women, and only male patients were numbed for it. I am aghast.

But since IUDs are generally given without pain or anxiety management, the disconnect is there. I am afraid if I push too hard, they will refuse me the IUD and I am on a deadline. I am in LDR and I will be seeing my boyfriend (hopefully) around Easter. I do not want to come back pregnant!

Sorry for the novella. But I am wondering if anyone is like me and knows a) what I should ask for to minimize my panic attacks and pain and b) what I can do in the absence of help from my OB.

What might you think is the ideal combo to address a certain full blown panic attack as well as high likelihood of a cervix that will be like Fort Knox? Any advice, experiences or tricks will be appreciated.

Thanks, TwoX!

ETA: I just want to say THANK YOU so much TwoX also for not saying "it's over fast!" because EVERYONE says that and it will not keep my twitchy ass in the stirrups. IT MEANS A LOT.  I don't have a lot of helpful advice, but I do sympathize!

I got an IUD inserted, and because most people I know found it to be No Big Deal, I figured I'd be okay to get it done in the morning and go right back to work. This despite the fact that I topple over like a Victorian lady at the sight of blood, basically have no pain tolerance, and get very nervous/panicky at the doctors. I also get knocked out if I have any dental work done, avoid needles, and have been banned from blood donation because I panic and pass out as soon as I'm attached to the machine. 

Needless to say, my insertion really hurt, and I ended up having to call in sick after nearly passing out at the waiting room and terrifying the staff. Here's what I've vowed to do next time:

1. Book a day, or even half-day, off work. 
2. Get someone to drive me to &amp;amp; from appointment. 
3. Take aspirin beforehand.
4. Bring a heat pad/hot water bottle for cramping during and after insertion. 
5. Bring a ipod with some awesome music to distract me during insertion. I don't know about you, but music really calms me down, and most medical professionals have been pretty cool about letting me listen to my tunes while having work done. 

The point is, even with me being unprepared and panicked, the experience was still survivable. The pain sucked and I wish I had been more prepared, but even with my wimpy nature it didn't last that long. Plus, I LOVE the IUD. It's totally worth it, but I think it's good that you are thinking about doing more to make yourself comfortable during and after insertion. Good luck!
 That does help! I did realize in typing all this that one thing I have been doing- manipulating my cycle so I can be period free when I see my bf- is something I can no longer do. So I have to think about that! That does help! I did realize in typing all this that one thing I have been doing- manipulating my cycle so I can be period free when I see my bf- is something I can no longer do. So I have to think about that! I took 800 mgs (usually 4 pills) every 4 hours when i got mine put in. Ask if you can have local anesthesia as that will numb up the area while they are working (but it will wear off shortly after so be prepared. They didn't tell me that I had gotten it so when it wore off and the pain hit while I was driving home it was quite a surprise). Thank you. I also have no fear of cramping or post-procedure discomfort. I am okay with even intense menses pain! It is more fear I am afraid of!  Find another doctor. My doctor did local anesthetic and I didn't feel a thing. It was a HUGE turnaround from a previous doctor who told me to take 2 aspirin, and I ended up in a horrible amount of pain with a previous IUD.  What was the local anesthetic? Maybe I can ask for it! Epinephrine Oooh. Does that make your heart beat faster? I get these AWESOME palpitations along with my panic attacks, don't be jelly. Yep, it did, and my leg shook a little bit for about 20 seconds. Totally bizarre, but preferable to the IUD insertion pain. Find another doctor. My doctor did local anesthetic and I didn't feel a thing. It was a HUGE turnaround from a previous doctor who told me to take 2 aspirin, and I ended up in a horrible amount of pain with a previous IUD.   I won't lie and say Mirena insertion was fun for me - it was about 10 seconds of the most intense pain I've ever experienced when they dilated me, then another little burst of pain when they inserted. Once they removed the inserting tool though, I felt nothing. Light cramping the rest of the day. I was more nervous than anything, but it was so quick that by the time the pain registered it was subsiding. My GYN told me to go to my doctor for a medication to dilate my cervix beforehand if I wanted to, but I decided not to after speaking with friends who had to be induced when they had babies. I took 800mg of Advil 1h before my appointment and another 400mg a few hours after, and spend the rest of the day in sweat pants snuggling with my dog. I was back to work the next day. I did have spotting, and you can't use tampons for a full cycle afterwards, but I'm back to normal now - except my periods are super light and short - 3-4 days, pantiliner or light tampon light.  That's great! Painwise I can actually usually handle pain even though my tolerance is low- I am just SOOO afraid of panicking because of procedures I've had that were framed as NBD and then turned out to be excruciating. 

I am trying to find out what I can take to make me not care!  Could you get a letter of support from your psychiatrist?  Something to say that medical procedures trigger your anxiety/panic attacks and that when possible (i.e. when it won't negatively effect the procedure) he recommends that the doctor prescribe medication to minimize your anxiety and pain (and list what has and has not worked well in the past)?  It may help to overcome some of the OBGYN's objections (and be helpful for future procedures as well). Your anxiety, combined with your previous history of difficulty dilating your cervix make it ridiculous for you to have to go through this procedure unmedicated.

Another possible approach is to verify if medication your already on will adversely effect the procedure (e.g. if you've already been prescribed medication to help during intense situations).

That said, it may or may not be worthwhile for you to hold off on the procedure until you can find a more supportive OBGYN (using alternative protection in the meantime). I did ask my doc about a letter and he said it shouldn't be necessary. I imagine I can have them contact one another but so far it hasn't gotten to that stage- like the PA has been like, basically, we don't do that. No one else needs it.

It is very validating to hear someone else say that my concerns are reasonable. Lots of my friends are like it isn't a big deal, and they have not seen me panic because it is so rare.

I am on nothing currently except Concerta for ADHD, and Ambien for anxiety induced constant insomnia. WCTW I can not take the Ambien that evening.  Ask your psych to contact your doctor. "Nobody else needed it" should not be an excuse. You are an individual with your own individual problems. Have your doctors speak.  How old is your kid? I had my IUD put in at 7 weeks postpartum, and when my midwife took the speculum out, I thought she had messed something up and I'd have to come back later because I had no pain. I had very mild cramping during the procedure and then mild period-like cramps for another half hour or so. The only pain medicine I took was 800 mg of ibuprofen beforehand. 

Even if you were pregnant a long time ago, the insertion should be easier than if you were never pregnant. I still think you should try to get some Valium for the procedure and have someone drive you home, but it might not be as bad as you're expecting. Could you have your psychiatrist call your OB? It seems weird that your office won't even discuss pain management - are you sure there isn't another OB you could see?  I haven't had it done yet.  My OB told me to call for an appointment and she would write pain meds and a Valium. 

This was before she screwed up on a cyst diagnosis for me. So I've been hesitant to go back to her.  Oh, wow! That would be a huge help I imagine. OBs are so hard because it's like, they can be great at some things and bad at others. I have had a hard time even getting BC so I feel like it's like, I should just do it. IDK. She missed pretty big diagnosis for me. Made me sicker for longer because of it. Thankfully I listened to my body and got another opinion.  That is scary and unsettling. Did the new doctor find it right away?

I have PCOS so part of the reason I would like to stick with this OB is that he is a regional expert and those are rare! Actually, the other doctor wasn't even an OB. A surgeon that use to be head of general surgery at a pretty big hospital. I had a bartholians cyst that had gotten huge all the sudden. I had a CT done for it. The OB read the CT and said "It's fine.". It was infected to the point of being hot to the touch. The surgeon had worked on skin lesions for me in the past. I knew he did labiaplasty. So I called his office and asked if he'd remove it. He is normally an easy going guy. He got so upset with my OB. He prescribed me antibiotics and did pretty major surgery the following week. It was a huge cyst.  His follow up care was beyond that of any I've had. 

This is my public service announcement for plastic surgeons. They do all kinds of things. They just do them prettier and with more precision. 

Apparently she has botched other things that he'd had to repair.  Actually, the other doctor wasn't even an OB. A surgeon that use to be head of general surgery at a pretty big hospital.

Apparently she has botched other things that he'd had to repair.  [deleted]  [deleted]  I'm sorry that you're so out of sorts about this. :/ All I can say is that while mine was uncomfortable, it really wasn't painful, and I didn't have bad cramps afterwards. For mine, there was a nurse present that offered to hold my hand if I wanted it, which was nice. I'd recommend having someone you trust with you when you're there; not sure they'd be allowed to hold your hand in the room, but at least they could comfort you before and after. &amp;lt;3  Take alieve before the appointment.  Naproxen is more effective with cramps than other NSAID's (according to a previous gyno).  

If you have had children &amp;amp; given vaginal birth, you are much less likely to feel as much pain than if you had a C-section or never had children.  I'm sorry that your OB isn't more helpful, but it is really hard to predict how much pain an IUD insertion would cause.  When I had mine, it was about a 5 on a pain scale from 1-10, but I didn't take any pain reducers and I haven't had any children.    I just wanted to say that I'm glad someone else asked this question.  My obgyn will also not give me any help with my anxiety over the procedure, and I'm pretty confused as to why.  It would be interesting to hear if other ladies had luck in asking around for a more compassionate doctor, or otherwise figured something out to get them to go through with the procedure.  I'm at the point where I can and really want to get this done, but I'm so afraid that I haven't been able to actually go through with it yet.  If you've passed at least one child through that cervix of yours, the IUD insertion will feel like some menstrual cramping.

Take some advil about an hour before the procedure. Insertion is not excruciating for everyone, at all, but it tends to hurt more for women who have never had children. 

For what it's worth- I had a non-hormonal IUD inserted at age 25, nulliparous. And no one told me to take advil. :p It was like, bad menstrual cramping, and I made it. Two c-sections! :) I should have mentioned that. Because of failure to progress, IE, no dilation. 

Edit: I think this MAY mean I am worse off than many nulliparous women who CAN dilate, but that's just a guess.

Edit2: Like my body went all the way into labor but couldn't get its shit together to follow through on dilation.  My cousin couldn't dilate either.  First kid was a c-section, perhaps because of it, I guess she was a little out of it because she didn't really remember. When kid two came along they were going to have her give birth but she wasn't dilating. After several hours she started feeling a different burning sensation and the intern didn't listen. When the doctor came back they took her into emergency surgery because the burning was kid two coming out through kid one's c-section scar, having burst the scar open from the inside. 

Now onto Merina, I never want kids so I hadn't given birth when I got it.  She told me to take a Motrin beforehand. It didn't help much.  The insertion should be scheduled for just as your period is ending so you're still open (or so I was told four years ago, not sure if that's changed). Mine was about a day late so it was hard to get the sucker in there. I think they ripped off a little chunk of flesh with the pincers trying to hold the organ steady. That hurt the worst, but the whole thing was a little uncomfortable, with like a minute of pretty intense pain, then just kind of uncomfortable to minor pain with period cramps later that were dulled just fine with Motrin.  It is not a big deal I promise. Jesus fuck holocaust! I think that the lede there is a ruptured incision! Holy fuck! That poor woman!

The "counter traction" bit sounds very scary.  Heh yeah I think her high pain tolerance worked against her as she was calmer than she should have been. It hadn't gotten through the skin, he was just coming out of the uterus into her abdomen so it's not like you could see a big blood stain or anything. 

It will be ok, honest, you can handle it. If you are done though you might consider Essure rather than having to shell out hundreds of dollars every five years for Merina. I just went with the IUD because I didn't want my period to be as heavy :)  I don't agree that the pain is excruciating. It's not even a smidge comparable to childbirth. 

When I had mine put in I had a local anesthetic, it was like anbesol for my cervix. I'm not sure if that's standard SOP or if it's something PP does for their patients. It didn't prevent me from feeling the pain, but it was a little more tolerable. The best way I can describe it is like a prolonged pinch. It was a bit unpleasant, but I think the epidural for my pregnancy was 10x worse than the IUD insertion. If you take a few Ibuprofen an hour or so beforehand and focus your breathing during the procedure by taking long, deep breaths in for 7 through your nose, out your mouth for 11, it should help you during the procedure. The discomfort of the procedure itself only lasts for 30-60 seconds. One its in and the speculum is out, it's crampiness you'll feel. I took Pamprin for a few days after I had mine inserted and that brought the discomfort down to what felt like generally standard PMS cramps. It kinda sucked, but it was tolerable.

I work in a GP's office and the physicians will periodically give something like Xanax or Ativan for someone having a CT or MRI, or dental work. Since you're currently seeking treatment and it is documented, your primary care physician might be willing to prescribe you something to help with the anxiety specifically for the day of the procedure. If nothing else, it's worth asking. I started seeing my psychiatrist (again) after issues with my GP prescribing my Ambien (which I have been on for 8 years.) Each and every time I went, I was scolded for "asking for a controlled substance" despite having been treated with it regularly. 

So I do need a new GP and I don't know it's ever good to go into a GP asking for ativan. I think that avenue is closed off for me for now. And the panic attack AT the GP was over the ambien thing, because they fucked up my prescription and forced me to take off work twice to come back in and fix their mistake. And then treated me like a drug addict.

So I went back to my psychiatrist, who is great. But it's difficult for me personally because my conditions (anxiety and ADHD) are treated with drugs that can be abused.

Am I making sense? I have no history of drug abuse but in order to continue my treatment the way it is I have to be very careful about what I request. I do think my best bet is HOPING my OB is open to calling my psychiatrist about the panic attacks and working out a single day or two of pain and anxiety management. The challenge is presenting this without sounding like a basket case.

And I am totally normal! I work, I raise my two kids alone, I never ever have an issue with this stuff (without my ritalin I forget things a lot and get stressed more easily) and I know this all sounds like, bitch, get it together, but I also know that even just having my blood pressure taken by someone who was hostile made me have the scariest panic attack.

This is going to sound totally nuts. But that one attack made my period start! My whole body just responds in terror even though I know intellectually it is just  a standard pinch.

And I want so badly to get through it because I know childbirth or abortion is even worse on a scale of pain and trauma! So even if like I was going to get a thing cut off or be in pain, the pain is secondary to my fear of being too anxious to complete the procedure.  You're definitely making sense. 

I'm sorry that the cards are stacked against you. Since the OB isn't able to talk to you directly about pain/anxiety management, your best path may be to write a formal letter to the OB detailing exactly what is going on, asking them to speak with the psychiatrist. That way it will come across as a thought-out, sincere request. A meeting of the minds between the psychiatrist and OB would be most beneficial to you in this situation.

I'm so sorry you're faced with this. I wish you the best, with lots of internet hugs! If you need anything, don't hesitate to PM me.

    This sounds like a really shitty situation... I can't understand why your OB won't discuss pain/anxiety management with you. I don't have GAD, but I, too, am currently on medication for ADD, and have taken concerta in the past.  Not sure how that's relevant, but I thought I would mention it. 

Here's some background on my IUD experience:  I am a pretty calm person when it comes to medical procedures and pain. I have never been afraid of needles or blood, and have been told by 2 doctors that I must have a relatively high threshold for pain after seeing how I handled pain on 2 separate occasions. In spite of this, I talked to my doctor about pain management prior to my insertion appointment and she gave me 2 pills to help "soften the cervix and promote dilation". Let me tell you, they did NOT do shit!! I went into my appointment totally calm and not expecting it to be too bad, as I had followed the instructions and taken naproxen beforehand as well as the special pills. I am sorry to say this to you, but it was BY FAR the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I've never given birth, so I know some ladies out there will think I don't know what I'm talking about, but I can only talk about my own experience, and this is absolutely the most pain I've felt. I'm not saying this to scare you, but just to strongly encourage you to either talk to your OB about these concerns and be strong about what you're asking for. Or please go see someone else who will be more helpful and compassionate. 

Having said all of that, my IUD has been 100% worth it and I highly recommend it! But actually getting it in was NOT fun. 

Just out of curiosity, based on what I understood from your previous comments you sound pretty sure you don't want any more kids... Have you considered getting your tubes tied?

Best of luck with all of this! Let us know how it goes :)   DEMAND opiates.  I had to fight with my doctor even though I have a chronic pain condition that makes me insensitive to NSAIDS like ibuprofen.  Also demand local anesthetic and a drug to soften your cervix. That should take care of it, but expect cramping (which you can also use the vicodin for) for the next two-three months. Opiates would be ideal. I have no prior history of any addictive behaviors, and I have never even tried hard drugs or anything. (I would like to state here that I don't think that should influence pain management, but a doctor might consider it.)

It bothers the shit out of me that we can adequately make people comfortable for procedures and we handle it this way. I am just very worried because they basically said no the first time *because* of my anxiety.

And then I told my psychiatrist that and he said it was astounding bullshit. But I have found that (and I reddited about this before), after I had my first baby at 21, I was given a litany of reasons I could not have the IUD. 

It's like they're doing me a goddamn favor. :D

Cramping I can handle, no complaints! It's something like, to me, it's not scary because even really painfully, no one is DOING anything to me.</snippet></document><document><title>Sisters Ughhhhhhh</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18pza7/sisters_ughhhhhhh/</url><snippet>So I have a little sister. We've had our ups and downs when we were children (3 years apart) but we love each other to death.

BUT. So we were, not distant, but not particularly close due to differences in opinion and personality. Over the past few years we've grown together. And apart again, now, apparently.

Anyway, she got with this new guy, who's great, and she seemed to grow up and I thought we had a close relationship.

Either it's changed, or we've grown apart. I don't know. But she's getting married now, and she made me her maid of honor. I've been working hard to give her as good a bachelorette and bridal shower as I can.

First she got her boobs done. We both had small chests, and not that I'm sensitive about it, but I know mine are small. Now that she's had her surgery, I understand that she's proud of her boobs, and she and her fiance did put a lot of money into them, but she keeps kind of throwing them in my face, and saying "well I'm not wearing a bra", and things that aren't necessarily rubbing it in my face, but just proud of her chest, and it bothers me because she knows I'm basically her before and could you not do that when I'm right next to you?

But whatever, I can deal with that.

Here's the other side of the coin: she's getting married. I put together her bachelorette party, got food and drinks and decorations together for a pre-party beforehand, and then at the drag show we went to, her little friends paid 1/3 of the bill and I covered the rest. I didn't mind, my bill situation is pretty simple right now, and although I'd love to be saving that money, my little sister is getting married so I'll do what I have to do. 

Now we just had her bridal shower. I was up til 4 in the morning getting ready, and I got up at 9 to finish getting everything together. Plus I spent much dinero and tiempo getting all this shit together for this. I put A LOT of effort into it (and money! I know I seem like a cheapo here, but she spent $30 and 2 hours TOTAL on my birthday, and her birthday's in two days and I've spent around a grand on her already).

The other night she called me and said "What time do you want me to be there? Like 11:30?" (the party started at 12 and I a couple days previously I had invited her to come over the night before to spend the night and watch Blood and Chrome, a Battlestar Galactica spin-off, which she'd not responded to). My response was "well you could get here a little earlier..." and she said "You want me to help set up my own bridal shower???" (maybe that's not normal, but my mom's paying for most of her wedding, and my mom and I were co-hosting it). 

Anyways, she ended up being late (thank goodness none of her friends have any manners and the ones who ended up showing up mostly came later than her) and the shower went off without a hitch.

Then, when it came time for the guests to leave, and it was just us and her bridesmaids (who brought cupcakes and fruit, in total), she bitched about having to help clean up and bagged up a couple of things, and decided it was time to leave with her little friends (the bridesmaids). And left our mom and I a huge mess to clean up. AND she left my mom's present!!!!! Who is poor and sensitive and put a lot of money and thought into her gift!

I just can't believe my little sister would do this. I am so tired of her bullshit and princess behavior (this isn't anything new, but it's never been to this extent) and I don't know what to do about it. I basically do not want to put any more effort into her wedding. I just don't care anymore. And I feel bad for that. But am I crazy? Is this normal behavior for an adult? What the hell?

**tldr** My sister's a spoiled little brat! What do I do?  I'm so sorry. I don't have a sister, but one of my best and oldest friends has a little sister who sounds a lot like yours. Fortunately, she's not engaged yet. 

I am kind of anti-wedding, so I have no qualms about stepping on toes and am really tempted to say that you should send all the bridesmaids a bill for the shower. You might also want to sit down one-on-one with your sister and tell her what's bothering you. Say that you're hurt because she didn't seem to appreciate all the work you put into her bachelorette party and wedding shower, and you're upset that she hurt your mom's feelings, too. 

But I think you also need to meditate on your own feelings and actions. I understand that you're really frustrated right now, but it comes off very harshly when you refer to her bridesmaids as "her little friends." They're just other people, and people like being told what to do. Clue them in on what you expect from them if you want to make sure they do something. Tell your sister where and when you want her to be, rather than suggesting that maybe she could possibly show up a few minutes early to a shower...? If she's not going to arrive at that time, let her tell you like an adult. 

As for the boobs thing...can't do nothin' about that. Her body pride need to reflect badly on you, so be proud of what you're rockin', too.   </snippet></document><document><title>I'm 16, will Planned Parenthood give me a Paragard IUD without parental consent?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18plt7/im_16_will_planned_parenthood_give_me_a_paragard/</url><snippet>Telling my parents is not really an option, as they are extremely conservative and would not approve of me having sex. I have a few hundred dollars saved up and have my own car, so cost/transportation isn't really an issue. I really don't want to go on any sort of hormones, that's why I'm looking at Paragard. I plan on using condoms too. The Planned Parenthood website seems kinda vague about all of this, so I'm just looking for some answers. I'm in Georgia, if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance, ya'll. 

Edit: So, I called PP. They have no objections to giving me the Paragard, but there's no sliding scale/financial aid in my state, so it's $600. I'm a few hundred dollars short. Fuck. Any ideas? 

Edit 2: Counted up all the money I have in my room/loose change in my car...comes out to $512.48. I have never wanted $87.52 so badly.  It's difficult to get an IUD in the US if you're young and/or haven't given birth.

Call your local PP to make an appointment with a nurse counsellor to discuss the best BC option for your situation. I had a hard time finding a doctor that would insert one when I was 19. Finally, I found a doctor that would do it two months ago and I do love it!

Here in the US there are a lot of doctors who are hesitant to insert an IUD in younger women because of the risks, especially if you've never given birth before (small uterus, difficulties opening the cervix, supposed higher risk of expulsion, etc.)

I second the vote for making an appointment and talking about options. It's difficult to get an IUD in the US if you're young and/or haven't given birth.

Call your local PP to make an appointment with a nurse counsellor to discuss the best BC option for your situation. I am 21 and have never given birth. Upon my first gyno visit they told me that Paragard would be the option given my situation. I don't think it's that difficult. It all depends on the doctor. I am a week from 20 and the doctor told me to stick to pills.  I hope this doesn't happen to me. I have a family history of strokes/blood clots, so I don't really want to mess with hormonal BC pills It's difficult to get an IUD in the US if you're young and/or haven't given birth.

Call your local PP to make an appointment with a nurse counsellor to discuss the best BC option for your situation. It's getting a lot more accepted to give IUDs to women who haven't had birth. It sounds like OP is a virgin though, so she probably will have a very hard time getting one, because IIRC they're still reluctant to give them to women who haven't had sex yet. Yep, I'm a virgin. I don't see how that's an issue though, it's not like there's a "test" or anything to see if you've had sex? Just wondering  It doesn't really matter except that I've heard that it's hardest to get an IUD if you're a young woman who isn't sexually active. Yes, you could lie and tell them you've had sex if you think it will help you get an IUD, and they can't actually tell if you've had sex. However, I strongly recommend that you not lie about your sexual history (and they will ask if you're sexually active) because it could prevent you from getting proper care and advice. Oh of course I don't plan on lying, it's just kinda silly to expect someone to be sexually active before starting any kind of birth control. I'd rather get birth control taken care of now so I don't have to worry about it when I actually start having sex (which will be very soon) It's not about starting just any kind of birth control before having sex, virgins get put on birth control all the time. I was on hormonal birth control for 6 years before having sex. It's specifically the kind that is implanted that tends to be more difficult to obtain for certain women, including, if I'm remembering correctly, virgins. I'm just saying that they will likely urge you to use a different form of birth control. If you really want it you should just go in and ask if they'll do it. Yeah honestly I think I've made up my mind already. I've looked at lots of different kinda of birth control, and I really do think Paragard is right for me. It's just a matter of finding a doctor who will give it to me haha Yep, I'm a virgin. I don't see how that's an issue though, it's not like there's a "test" or anything to see if you've had sex? Just wondering  Because if you're not sexually active theres no reason to have the nonhormonal form of an IUD inserted. It  provides no other health benefit but preventing pregnancy.  I don't really need any other health benefit. I just want pregnancy prevention. I plan on becoming sexually active hopefully in the very near future It's difficult to get an IUD in the US if you're young and/or haven't given birth.

If you get any resistance from your doctor because of your age, mention that.  I don't plan on going to a "normal" ob-gyn; I'm just wondering if Planned Parenthood will even give IUD's to minors. PP is as normal as any other; many people use it as their primary reproductive health services. Don't discount them as 'abnormal' simply because they may not be on your insurance list.  Why not just call them and ask...? I plan on calling tomorrow. I just wanted some other opinions just to make sure I don't sound completely crazy, ya know?  Im 26 and I have never been pregnant and got an IUD inserted Wed. My concern would be make sure you have insurance just in case something happens. The best thing to do would be to call and ask about consent, cost, and followups.

I know you would know your parents best, but is there an older sibling, cool aunt or cousin that you could talk to and have on your side if you try and talk to your mom? You could bring up that having a baby would be detrimental to your future ( getting into the workforce, going to college ) and that besides the doc and them, no one will know you have it. I wish insurance were an option. Unfortunately, I'm an only child, so I don't have any siblings to talk to. I'm going to college next year and, knowing my parents, if they found out I wanted birth control, probably would decide to not to pay for my tuition like they've promised. I can't risk telling them. None of my other family live nearby, either. It's a shame because my parents are both highly educated (mom is an RN with a master's degree, dad is a retired doctor) but they both have really backwards views on sexuality. Depending on your university, they may require you to carry insurance while enrolled. So if you aren't able to get one before, you would be able to get one once you get to college. I hope that PP can help you out though, because everyone should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies.

Good luck with it and please let us know how it turns out.  I really kind of doubt it as getting and IUD placed is a very minor form of surgery. This is what I was worried about ):
I really love the idea of having non hormonal, long lasting birth control, blahh I was in your position and got one, saying "my body doesn't react well to hormones" (the truth) was how I got my gyno to agree with me. Did you get yours at pp? I can't get insurance involved so I can't really go to a normal gyno  No, but I went to a PP home on break and they said they'd give it to me if I was there on my next period. I was back at school when that happened so I had to wait and use a private doctors office elsewhere. Oh so you have to get it inserted on your period? I was not aware of that ):       Definitely not. It's difficult for even a young adult woman to get one in the states, let alone a teenager having one in secret. It's just not going to happen. If you don't want hormones, then you'll have to use condoms religiously, or look into a diaphragm or spermicide. Spermicide irritates my lady parts, unfortunately. Diaphragms are prescription only (I'd have to go to a PP to get one anyway) and is only about 71-86% effective with typical use. I just want the Paragard for the added protection, along with using condoms.  Out of curiosity, if you're a virgin, how do you know that spermicides irritate your lady parts? I only ask because the most common application of them that I've heard of is with spermicidal condoms, which of course you'd likely only have near your lady parts  during protected sex. Definitely not. It's difficult for even a young adult woman to get one in the states, let alone a teenager having one in secret. It's just not going to happen. If you don't want hormones, then you'll have to use condoms religiously, or look into a diaphragm or spermicide.</snippet></document><document><title>I don't know how to help my sister with my mother. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18qcau/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_sister_with_my_mother/</url><snippet>My mother(Kay) turns 55 next month. This past Monday she was found at her "home" * suffering from alcohol with drawl. Kay was rushed to the ER where she had a seizure. After a week in a neuro wing at the hospital she was let go. My sister (sis) was there to take to her house. I feel absolutely helpless, as I live 1400 miles away. So fact to help understand. Kay and I spoke maybe once a year. She was drinking somewhere around 1/2 gallon of vodka a day. Sis is a new mom and the only working income in that house. Kay can't support her self so she can't stand and is wearing depends. She's also been a week with out cigarettes. * Kay's home is without power and running water. 

I want to help Sis, find a social worker or state help. I can't leave to be there with her. I'm limiting personal information, but all my news comes via texts or short phone calls. I just feel so lost.   I don't know the systems where you are (I'm Australian), so I hope you get the right info soon. 

If I was your sister I would wish you to keep in touch (discuss how often to ring etc), understand what I am going through, and help with decision making while understanding that I am the one on the scene.

I would want you take take on any action you can, like finding out info, sending emails etc.

And I would want you to let me talk about how hard it is and how exhausted I am etc.

I would want you to say things like "I can hear how hard it is, I wish I could do more. What I can do is this.... would that help?"

Best wishes to you all. Bravehearts. Thanks, I've agreed to help cover cost where I can. USA and Sis is in California.

I find that it gets in the way, makes my face itchy, and irritates me to no end. I usually just put it in a bun on a daily basis. Funny thing is when I decide to wear it down for special occasions I get an overwhelming amount of shit for it. "Look who decided to do something with their hair for once!" Or my favorite is, " You look soo much prettier when your hair is down!. That one definitely hurts the most. And it's NEVER men that make the mean comments, it's always women that are family members or friends. Its not that I'm lazy, or a tomboy, I Just freak out when it's touching my face. Any other ladies face this problem? What do you say when people are mean about it?    I quite often get the whole "oh! you look SO much nicer when you do X" crap.  I've found a way of dealing with it and (I found) with practise it really helps.  
my instant reaction was always to nod or agree or make some excuse and just general babbling. DON'T DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.

Just stare at them.  Sounds stupid I know.  but as SOON as you hear the sentence uttered, before they finish just stare them straight in the face with the most blank expression you can muster (no trace of hurt or disgrace) and just stare them right in the eye and count to five in your head.  This long (and sometimes agonising) five seconds of awkward silence is enough time for them to realise what they've said is fucking rude.  
As soon as you're done staring the shame out of them, just blink and change the subject entirely.

Sometimes they apologise and sometimes it's just awkward.  but I find it always makes me feel better - it's like a silent "fuck you".  And also people often don't do it again after this.

Anywho, I hope my ramblings help.

*edit* - oh and I forgot to say - SCREW THEM! do what makes YOU feel comfortable.  It's sounds like your family is making mindless small talk, not criticizing you. Just say "thanks" in a flat tone and move on.  iI definitely wouldn't put it in the category of small talk, more like backhanded compliments. iI definitely wouldn't put it in the category of small talk, more like backhanded compliments. iI definitely wouldn't put it in the category of small talk, more like backhanded compliments.  I used to have long hair and wear ponytails every day. It just annoyed me and appeared dirty and blah after half a day anyway. 

My solution? I chopped it off to pixie length, and now it's not in my face or ever bothering me! So low maintenance. Best. Ever.                 Its just some bullshit novelty, I think. I used to have a waist-long superthick mane. Most people would refer to my hair as a "mane" multiple times and it kind of stuck. It was almost always said in a positive way so I liked it. But then I came to college, and wind happened. Its not like I didn't spend time outside in high school--I worked outside actually, even in the winter. I worked on a horse farm. I always had my hair up in a bun when I worked because...well why would I want my hair whipping around when I'm cleaning dirty horses? 

Then I went to college, and I had to walk long distances outside while still trying to look pretty. This shit was intolerable after a while, and I felt like Medusa with even the slightest breeze. SO I wore my hair up in a bun or pony tail or braid almost every day after I quickly tired of the wind sending my locks into a crazy flying mop. I got a lot of comments like you, OP .. "OH WHY DONT YOU EVER WEAR YOUR HAIR DOWN ANYMORE?" leave me alone! it's not practical someitmes!

My solution was to finally just cut it all off. I have a supershort haircut now (I alternate between a pixi cut and a fauxhawk, seasonally) and its awesome. If it's windy, it doesn't matter at all. It doesn't get in my face. I can style it a million ways. It's awesome.

It's probably kind of "extreme" but seriously...you should consider it! If you are always throwing your hair up into the same bun just because it's annoying to have hair get in your face, why not go ahead and lop it all off? There are tonnes of ways you can style your hair when it's really short with some cheap gel from the drugstore. It's awesome. Out of curiosity- how difficult was it to find a pixie cut that you felt okay with after having a "waist-long superthick mane" for so long? I've had super-thick long hair since kindergarten, and recently I've been toying with it, cutting bangs, then trimming and adding some layers. Nothing serious, just scissors in the bathroom. 

But I've been thinking of doing just what you did, and well, I'm just curious. How does the pixie cut work with the thick hair? Is it curly? Wavy? Stick straight? How much effort do you put into styling it, usually? Honestly, I had to give 100% of my trust to the woman that cuts my hair. I told her I had no idea what would look good, I just wanted to be able to style it lots of different ways and not have it be poofy (you know, from the thickness of my hair. everytime i went to the salon and get my hair washed pre-cut, for most of my life, the washer girls always said they've never seen hair as thick as mine)  I, like you, hadn't had short hair since pre-school. So it was a big step. I had already been toying with the idea of cutting my hair off, because I started to see a lot of really cute short hair cuts on other girls in my classes and around campus. What actually put the nail in the coffin for me was a bad hair dye accident---I tried really hard to fix my hair on my own, and it just wasn't happening. I allowed some of my roots to grow out, and when it was long enough, I made the leap and made the appointment to get it cut off and styled. 

I like that I can either do nothing to my hair or use different products to get different styles and textures. On a normal basis, I use Argan oil in my hair right after I shower to keep the poof down. I always have my hair thinned out (ask your hair cutter, he/she should know how to do this) when I get cuts, but any kind of humidity will make my hair poof up if I dont use a little argan oil. After that, I honestly don't have to do anything if I don't feel like it. Most of the time as of late that's how I've been--although that's at least half because it's winter time and I usually wear hats when I walk around campus in the cold, and also because I work in retail and I dont think my boss would like it if I came in with my hair spiked up in a mohawk. [This was a photo taken right after the big cut](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/395522_10150668511805225_681888984_n.jpg). I actually ended up getting it cut and styled much much shorter after that, but I love what she did to my hair. She is the only person I let touch my hair now. [Here's a before shot](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/430797_10150668510215225_1334150290_n.jpg). I did say my hair was waist-long (it was a couple months before the big cut) but I had cut quite a bit off a couple months before this photo was taken. You can see that my hair kind of had a mind of its own and it would randomly get wavy in some places for no particular reason. For one thing, I havent used a blowdryer on my hair in at least ten years (except for when I had gotten hair cuts at the salon), all i would put in was argan oil to control the frizz. So it just kind of did its own thing. After getting it cut, it does sort of have a pattern it falls into, but it is generally super relaxed. I have no idea why my hair behaves so differently when it's short compared to when its long, but I much prefer how it is when it's short. [Here's my hair on a typical day where I don't really do anything to style it](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/428342_10150712900235225_1809394224_n.jpg).

eta: wow, I just wrote way too much about the merits of short hair &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; kudos to you if you read all that, it looks like procrastination is getting the best of me Oh my heavens, your hair is fantastic. 

I think if I can find a hairdresser I really trust (seeing as I don't really have one right now), I might go down that path...

My periods are so much lighter (most days a regular tampon is a waste), shorter and less painful and I have a nice short window in which they're supposed to arrive. My acne has gotten better as well, but that could just be because I'm no longer a teenager. 

   IUD, IUD, IUD.


I'm on the copper Paraguard, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Sex is better, my periods are better and more consistent, and no more goddamn pregnancy scares for 10 years.&#160;I'm the kind of person, however, who's ultraparanoid about synthetic hormones in my body. Mirena may be a better match for you.  Did you try the pill before an IUD? </snippet></document><document><title>Happy 6th Birthday IUD</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18o06c/happy_6th_birthday_iud/</url><snippet>6 years ago (yesterday) I got my Paraguard IUD.  I was 19 and bad at the whole birth control thing.  It was the best choice I could have made.  In the 6 years I have had this sucker I have no pregnancy scares, 1 issue about 3 years in were it shifted and I had to get an ultra sound to make sure it didn't go on walk about, and lots of worry free sex.  My body is happy, I'm happy and should i be ready to have kids when I pull it out when I am 29 it will have served me well and cost me less then $2 per month.  Needless to say Happy Birthday IUD.  Keep doing what you are doing.   Hooray. Paraguard didn't work out for me, but my Mirena has been beautiful for the past 6 months. I love it, and it was free. I just got an implanon IUD put in after my mirena fell out. Yup fell out, was changing a tampon and felt something not quite right and out it came, I had it for almost 3 years so it was a good run. But boy did it give me a shock  Implanon is not an IUD, it's a birth control implant. Its a little stick filled with hormones that they put in your arm. I was a little confused at first! haha    How is your cycle with Paragard? I'm potentially considering one but I don't want the extra pain, long, heavy periods that a lot of users seem to have. 

Never had kids here and when I am off the pill, my period is about 4 days with only one heavy and cramping varies. I don't want to go and bleed heavily and painfully for 9 days or something. Not the OP, but I got a paragard in November.  My periods are 2-3 days longer (so 6-7 days total) and the bleeding is slightly heavier (takes about 4 hours to "fill" a super tampon, as opposed to 4 hours for a light tampon while on the pill and 4 hours for a regular tampon when on no BC).  They don't hurt any worse, with the exception of my first period with Paragard which wasn't that bad but was worse than usual, and they seem to happen less often.  I assume I'm still adjusting to the IUD, and every period has been lighter/easier than the last.

Overall I'm happy with it and have found periods to be very bearable.  I originally wanted mirena but my OBGYN steered me towards paragard and I'm glad I took her advice. Out of curiousity, why did she steer you toward the Paraguard over the Mirena? I don't have any children, and I don't want any (at least not for a long time).  She said paragard tends to be better accepted than mirena by women who haven't given birth, plus I won't have to replace it in 5 years. Damn my OB-GYN! She didn't mention that it's better accepted. I guess it's nice that I no longer have periods, cramps, or moodswings, but I've had a mighty bloody months since I got it, and I still get occasional spotting. Still deciding if it's worth it. Well by "better accepted" she meant that your body is less likely to expel the IUD, not necessarily that there would be less serious side effects. How is your cycle with Paragard?

I've had Paragard for a year. I love it but I think it's causing me problems. I've had chronic pain for a year and a half that worsened significantly a year ago and I'm starting to think (after a multitude of tests) that it might have something to do with the IUD. It's served me well, and but I'm getting it taken out on Monday. I fit turns out the pain is due to something else I will certainly get another one though! Anyone ever had experience with or heard of this kind of IUD/copper sensitivity? Paragard has a tiny amount of nickel inside of it in addition to the copper.  If you're sensitive to nickel OR copper, it will give you issues.  One quick test is to see how you react to cheap earrings (usually made of nickel).  If they irritate your ears, then you're probably sensitive to nickel. I've had Paragard for a year. I love it but I think it's causing me problems.

Anyone ever had experience with or heard of this kind of IUD/copper sensitivity?     I have a gynefix (http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Intrauterine_device.html ) which is a frameless IUD. Not available in the US :( But it is great. I don't notice anything. No cramps. The only downside is, it needs replacement after 5 years already (I'm going for four and a half years... better be safe than sorry, right?).  I want a Gynefix! Where did you get it? I wouldn't worry about getting it out early though. In the 80's the ParaGard was approved for 5 years, now it's approved for 12.  The newer it is, the less time there's been for clinical trials which are expensive to begin with. The guidelines are overly cautious (as they should be!) but it's usually the point where they decided to end the study rather then an expiration date upon which it becomes less effective.  I live in Germany, not in the US :( But if you Google gynefix USA there is a blog entry from a woman who went to Canada to get one...

... but I think it's just a matter of time until the gynefix becomes available in the US too.
  This gives me hope, thanks. I got my Paragard about a month ago and it's been one very painful, bloody month...    So I must ask, for those who do have an IUD, how is it for you and your significant other if he is a bit more well endowed than average? My boyfriend is pretty large at 8.5" and I've heard of it possibly hurting or even cutting them if they push in too deeply. I'd really like to get an IUD... but after hearing that, I've been a bit more weary :| So I must ask, for those who do have an IUD, how is it for you and your significant other if he is a bit more well endowed than average?

I just don't know where to turn anymore and what to do. If this isn't the right place to put this I'll move it elsewhere. Sorry in advance for this long horribly formatted post, long day and I have a migraine.

background:
For starters I am 21 year old female and I go to college full time and live at home with my mom and brother. I am studying animal science and working towards a degree and a bright future. The problem is my home life and how stressed and burned out it makes me feel. My abusive dad moved out of state when I was 15 which made my mother a single mom which is tough. She was great, she would work hard, provide for my brother and I, and was a caring mother. I tried to help out however I could. I worked a lot and would give her my entire paycheck except for $30 for gas, I would help with chores, help my brother with his hw, and basically be a co-parent. 

Things really started going downhill when she got laid off. She did not want to look for another job, she started drinking more frequently, and she constantly complains about how we are broke. These days she naps a lot and watches a lot of t.v. We live off of a savings fund her father left her before he died. She also says that life is not worth living and she wouldn't care if she died tomorrow. She buys my brother a lot of junk food even though diabetes runs in our family and lets him play tons of video games even when he was failing a lot of classes. I try to talk to her about this but she gets incredibly defensive. She seems really depressed and I don't know how to help her.

So a few months ago she was drinking, and she was talking to me about life, how depressed she is, etc etc and I was trying to help her out. I tried to give her advice and she kept getting snippier and snippier until she full on exploded on me and called me a "know it all bitch." It hurt really bad because I only try to help her out and my little brother who is now 17. I calmly explained to her that when she is drinking, she tends to say and do hurtful things. She started calling me things like a manipulative, bossy, bitch and how I am super stuck up and generally a shitty person, just like my father. It turns into me crying and asking where the hell my mom is since this bitter, drunk person yelling at me can't be her. My mom responded that I'm only crying for sympathy and I'm not getting any of her sympathy. I screamed back how when I was sexually abused for a long time by her father and other family members and told her about it she did not seem to care and pointed out how she was really never there for me emotionally when I needed her. She went off about how her childhood was way worse and I should JUST GET OVER IT. (Her mom did not raise her, her grandma did, but according to my mom she had the "perfect suburban life") I also brought up that she is the only mom I have and how horrible my dad was to me and how I appreciate her and love her even though she is mean sometimes. She just stared at me with a stony, emotionless face which hurt like hell. It makes me cry thinking about it. I sobbed and ran to my brother who hugged me and stood up for me and yelled at my mom for being mean.

 After this huge fight is over and months pass, nothing is changed except that she quit drinking somewhat. She still naps all day, she still competes about who had a worse childhood, and she still makes living there hard. She does not remember all the money I gave her for groceries or all the little things I would do for her. I feel like the balance and harmony between my family, I try to help my mom keep her sanity and help my brother through high school and motivate him towards college and I'm so stressed and feel as though I am not appreciated by anyone and I'm trying to maintain a good gpa. My mom downplays everything and it makes me feel horrible. When I was 18 I wanted to go to therapy for my sexual abuse but she refused to help out and instead nagged about how I just sit around all day. (I was depressed and suffering from PTSD.) I got my own counseling, I sobered myself up and went back to school, and my mom complained about the $10 she had to pay a week for counseling which I found at a very low cost community program. I love my mother to death but I want to explode with rage sometimes over how fucked I feel and I feel as though I am regressing to not giving a shit about school or sobriety or anything. 

So anyways, I don't know what to say to her, how to help her see how I feel, I don't have any money to move out, and it's gotten so bad that I just keep getting depressed and angry over it which is ruining my life. Can anyone help?

tl;dr: My mom is depressed, she acts means towards me, I try to help out the whole family and I'm just sick of being attacked and not appreciated by anyone over my wasted effort. What the heck do I do?

Sorry again for this crappy post
  I don't really have any advice other than hang in there and get out as soon as you can. Don't feel responsible for her. You can't put her care (or your brother's) above your own. Just focus on getting yourself into a better situation and let her be the adult that she is supposed to be and take care of herself. 

*hugs* I hope it works out for you.   First off, *hugs*! I know how hard it is to try and get through university while living in a house that is torn apart by mental illness and alcoholism. 

When I was in university, my brother (who is 3 years older than me) started drinking heavily and being violent. Despite the fact that no one could make a sound at home when he was studying in university, I never had a moment's peace because he was always screaming at my mom if he didn't get his own way (usually in the form of beer or money for weed). My dad also lost his job in my 1st year of university due to his mental illness (severe bipolar disorder) making him unsafe for work, and between that and my brother's student debt that my parents had cosigned for, they were unable to help me aside from giving me a place to sleep. For my 1st, 2nd and 3rd years of university I spent most of my time at my then-boyfriend's house. He had a lot of issues with depression, anxiety, and was diabetic. When he was depressed, he refused to take care of his diabetes, and often threatened suicide whenever we got into an argument. We broke up at Christmas that year, and all of a sudden I was plunged back into my parents house, which by now had become a full-on warzone. Holes in the walls, police there almost every night, etc. I dropped half of my classes, started missing work at the job I loved (working at a record store, which I assure you is probably the most fun thing ever!) and was having panic attacks almost daily. It took months before my mother even noticed, as she was so wrapped up with the misery in the rest of the house. I remember a conversation with her where I told her I didn't care if I lived anymore, that I really just didn't want to deal with it anymore. I went to my doctor and was diagnosed with stress-related anxiety and seasonal depression, and told I had to move out of my parents house immediately, as my brother had already thrown my down the stairs and given me a concussion on two separate occasions and it was only going to get worse. I moved into a dorm on campus for my 4th year, and ended up having to work full time while taking a full course load to afford it. It was hands down the best decision I have ever made. I had to cut out the toxic people in my life in order to have a life myself. I still struggle with depression sometimes, but I'm really aware of it now and I can usually tell when I'm "slipping" and pull myself out of my funk so long as it hasn't gotten too bad.

If it's at all possible, I really suggest moving out of your mothers' home. She is your parent, not the other way around. It is not your job to mother her. The best thing you can do for yourself and your little brother is take care of yourself. I also recommend having a chat with your brother about his eating habits and activity level. He is a minor, but he's not a child. He is old enough to understand the consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle. He is also old enough to get a job and help out just as you did, or at the very least put some cash away for his own living expenses when he hits college next year.  That sounds like a way hard situation and I'm so glad you made it out! Is your family better now? My brother doesn't really seem to listen when I talk to him about everything, he is comfortable living here. He told me that he doesn't really care about how depressed my mom is and I just don't know how to reach out to him. I can try to move out but I live in California and the cost of living is ridiculous on minimum wage :/ Maybe i'll talk to my bf about looking at apartments Things were better for a time at my parent's home, as they kicked my brother out and he was in rehab. He lasted about 4 months after rehab and decided to start drinking again, and he's also very manipulative (ie - "I'm trying so hard, just give me one last good night!" but it's every night). He's since been kicked out of several apartments, two more rehab programs, and a slew of other mental health programs due to manipulative behaviour and his refusal to follow the rules. My parents keep letting him back in the house, so I moved back out again in December (had to move home after a bad breakup last year). I am doing really well - I've never been happier or more healthy, and I finally feel like a self-sufficient adult :) I'm really glad you're doing well! I'm sorry about your brother though, it's really tough to live in a situation with someone who is in trouble like that. My father is a manipulative alcoholic so living with him was horrid, I'm so glad he moved out. Keep up the good work though! :)   Sounds like your mother had a shitty life. I bet she wanted to give you a better one than hers. I think she feels she failed. Show her how strong she made you. You keep fighting back and not giving up on her. She may not know that, but she needs it. She lost her husband, later her job. That's a serious blow to ones psyche. Having a daily routine, even a shit job, can improve your self esteem. Get rid of all the alcohol, that shit is literal brain death. Get her to a support group, go with her, and do not judge. Help her most by not giving up on her.

When you fight and she gets meanest is when you get closest to the truth. Just because she got older and had kids does not mean she got a chance to grow up. Or maybe she never had a chance to have a childhood, and wants it. If she truly wanted to die, she would have. She has a reason to stay, she needs a reason to live. 

or maybe i am totally wrong, i am no expert. No, I think you are pretty spot on. I try to get her to counseling or AA meetings but she always replies with "it's too late for me" and that's when I try to encourage her and she gets angry at me. I remember crying and telling her that my motivation to do something great is all the people around the world who are struggling but are still happy to be here, alive in this moment. It didn't seem to click though but I think someday it will.

This reply is great, it gives me more insight from an outsider's perspective which I needed. Thankyou! She gets angry because your right and she knows it. If you choose to go the route of confrontation its important that you never lose your cool. you can't let her make you an enemy. That's what she does when she is afraid, she will push away everyone. She will do it through mean words and callus deeds. She doesn't probably mean it either. Too much fear and anger can twist a person to do and say things they wouldn't otherwise. 

When was the last time she had a chance to openly vent herself? I mean does she have a friend she confides in or does she spend most of her time not alone, but lonely. Moping around the house in a general malaise. Diaries have helped me in the past, but not as much as i have found online helps. Get her on reddit, or some other social activity. sociable human contact helps. She mainly mopes around the house. She does not have any hobbies or does much of anything actually. She uses me as a vent for her frustration or other family members that she calls up. I try to get her out of the house or online but she doesn't like it so I have no idea what to do. This sounds like depression. When i battled my way out of depression i had to choose something to live for. She needs a reason to fight and i cant help her there. I do know that depressed people get locked in thought patterns that spiral downward. You feel shitty over how shitty your life is and that makes you feel more shitty. Then you think that everybody thinks your lazy and useless, then you feel more shitty. Its a bad spiral that is a bitch to break from. 

All i wanted when i was depressed was someone to listen to my complaints and give a shit about my future, i had friends and family all around me and none of them could help. I refused to let them. I didn't want them to know how bad it felt for me. I didn't want my family to pity me. I was completely wrong. My family does not pity me, nor have they ever. It took me a bit to realize that what i thought people thought of me was not what they actually thought of me. My depression got the better of my judgement.  Yes, I do believes she is depressed. She says her reason to live is her kids, and she says that is the only reason she's here. I tried telling her yesterday that the way I climbed out of depression was by changing my attitudes towards things but she did not seem very receptive. Maybe I'll suggest that she invites her friend over for a bbq since the weather is gorgeous and she will talk to her and feel a bit better. Thank you for the insight and I'm glad you're doing better :)  I think the worst part of depression is that nobody can take you out of it, you have to do it yourself. That's very true. My friends and family kept trying to help and months later I made baby steps until finally I got myself out of it. I really hope my mom can help herself because it's been a really long time. I try to tell her just do small steps but honestly I think she's waiting for a magic cure. She says the classic line: "If only I had x,y, or z I would be happy." Sounds like your mother had a shitty life. I bet she wanted to give you a better one than hers. I think she feels she failed. Show her how strong she made you. You keep fighting back and not giving up on her. She may not know that, but she needs it. She lost her husband, later her job. That's a serious blow to ones psyche.

Or maybe she never had a chance to have a childhood, and wants it. If she truly wanted to die, she would have. She has a reason to stay, she needs a reason to live. 

or maybe i am totally wrong, i am no expert.  That house sounds toxic. I think you really need to figure out a way to get out of there. Even if that means taking a year off school or going to school part time and working. Do you have any other family members or friends you can live with?   Maybe you and your bro can move out? I'm so sorry, it sounds hellacious.  You are doing the best you can and you sound so strong.  

Seriously, your brother is old enough now to be strong/adult.  I'd talk the situation over with him and see if you two can't formulate some sort of coping and/or exit plan.  First of all, kudos to you on getting the help you needed and working hard to break the cycle of dysfunction that seems to be plaguing your mom's family.  Getting established as an adult can be challenging even for people that had the best of childhoods, let alone having to support two other people while doing so.

As obvious as it may seem to you and the rest of us reading this that your mom needs help, the sad truth is that it will be impossible for her to change unless she decides that it's time and commits to making all the necessary changes herself.  It's great that you're invested in helping your family, but it's leaving you empty and jeopardizing success in other areas of your life, so I'd suggest you start looking for an exit strategy ASAP.  It's time to stop worrying about helping her so much and start helping yourself.  You're her daughter, not her caseworker, and you should not feel responsible for her.

For now, see if you have any friends or family in the area willing to let you stay with them at least a few days a week.  Having a safe, quiet space to work and relax in will do wonders for your mental health and help keep you from falling behind in school.  Also be mindful of the company you keep - try to surround yourself with smart, motivated, and positive people, and it'll be easier for you to bring out those qualities within yourself.  Start saving up to move out, maybe look for a roommate to help subsidize costs; since it sounds like you and your brother are fairly close, he could be a good candidate.  And of course, don't be afraid to seek out help if you need it.  Going back to therapy doesn't make you a failure, it just means you've got a little more learning to do.

Right, I just need some support really. I'm engaged to the most wonderful guy on the planet, we're living miles apart while I finish off uni and of course I got pregnant. I found out that I was nine weeks along when I went for a routine check-up and got blasted with the heartbeat and everything. 
While everyone has been supportive, we just can't do it. It's not fair to the potential baby, nor to us and our families to go through with it. So I decided to go for abortion, but I feel really awful about it. So yeah, please some support.

Sorry for the lack of coherence, these are dire times.   I'm not sure whether you just want support for your decision, or whether you want to talk through both sides. I apologise if this is out of line.

There's nothing wrong with the choice you've made, it's sensible and reasonable. But, if the choice feels really bad to you, as a gut feeling, then don't feel that you *have* to have an abortion just because it's sensible. Life doesn't always follow a neat straight line; there are a lot of student parents who find ways of making it work, eg. taking a year out, some unis  have support available for student parents, he could move or you could transfer, perhaps one of your parents could help with childcare just until uni is done. With a stable relationship and supportive family, you probably could find a way of making this work. It wouldn't be ideal, but plenty of families don't start in ideal circumstances.

Whatever happens, I wish you strength and comfort. I'm not sure whether you just want support for your decision, or whether you want to talk through both sides. I apologise if this is out of line.

Whatever happens, I wish you strength and comfort.   Because the right choice can still be a hard choice.      Who knows why it feels bad. It could be any of a myriad reasons; if you live in any Western society there's a fair likelihood that you're entrenched in a kind of religious narrative that places mythological importance on the developing fetus. If you're in any other society, it's probably even worse than that. Maybe there are purely biological mechanisms which manifest in your experience as emotional intensity. Maybe it's the expectations of your loved ones who have otherwise been so full of support. Maybe it's all of the above. 
 
But if you think about it for a little while, maybe pain is a fair trade for what you're doing. You're taking responsibility for yourself, your loved ones, and your potential child; in essence, exacting sovereignty over your existence, wielding the power that is truly yours and yours alone. This flies in the face of cultural context and tradition, religious narrative, *gender* narrative, and maybe also the circumstances which have up until now determined your experience of life. The physical universe serves up certain questions via its interaction with human experience - why am I here, why am I going to die, etc. - and for many people, these questions are not so much answered as they are ignored, avoided by e.g. religious mythology, identity construction, and (increasingly in secular Western societies) the sweet oblivion of consumption and easy access excess. Some even consciously answer the "why am I here" with having a child, which - for all the great things that come with parenthood - also is a little bit of a cop out, as it amounts to merely posing the question to the child at a later time. 
 
So maybe it hurts because you're breaking *new ground*, you're literally going where you've never gone before: you are coming into the bizarre and superbly perplexing fact of your own existence, and you're learning minute by painful minute that the stock answers might not be the right ones for you.  Hey, I agree with what you're saying for the most part, but I just wanted to point out that "mythological importance on the developing fetus" might come off rather offensive. Perhaps it's mythology to you, but it isn't to everyone. Many people have an internal struggle with their opinion on when a fetus should be considered a life, I think it's a pretty valid moral conflict. Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-choice and agnostic, I just found your wording rather condescending. I know there are nuts out there who shove their religion and/or morals at people, but it isn't wrong for people to be conflicted about abortion (so long as they respect others' choices). Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, so forgive me if I am.

Anyways, you have some solid, insightful thoughts on this. Hopefully OP reads your post. :) Who knows why it feels bad. It could be any of a myriad reasons; if you live in any Western society there's a fair likelihood that you're entrenched in a kind of religious narrative that places mythological importance on the developing fetus.

Definitely check out /r/chickflixxx! Most of the time the links are exactly what I'm looking for. If not, just ask and someone will help you find porn that's to your liking. Good luck! Chickflixxx (for me) is much better than normal porn, but still has the problem of not having enough of the man in the scenes.  I just checked out the first few links, and every one was still 70-100% shots of the girl.  It would be really cool to have a subreddit where the rules dictated that the porn posted there had to include a man on screen at least as much as the woman.  (either 50% with the main focus being the man, or a shooting style that focuses on each partner equally.)  That's what I like in porn, and it is Sooooo hard to find!  

Edit:  Number five though?  totally works ;P I remember a study that said something about how women tend to identify with the woman in pornos. I'm not much bisexual,(maybe 5% if that's at all possible to quantify) but I do like looking at the woman as well as seeing a man with her. Then again, everyone just has different kinks... Well that would make sense that they identify with the women in the pornos.  But I think what you mean is that they focused on the women too?  And I think that is true as well.  But I wonder if that is out of necessity because of how little the men are shown.  At least for me, I definitely identify with the woman, but I focus on the man when he is present and attractive, you know?  I get off on seeing the guy.. There's no doubt that some women (like you) get off by focusing on the guy, but there seems to be some evidence that the majority of women aren't as focused on the guy. This point is really illustrated when you consider who watches porn featuring men sleeping with men and women sleeping with women. The majority of heterosexual male porn viewers enjoy watching two women sleeping with each other, but I think it's much more rare for heterosexual women to get off by watching two men sleeping with each other. 

If you really just want porn that focuses on men then there's tons of gay porn that features nothing but men, but this doesn't seem to be appealing to most women.

Most of the porn that James Deen makes appeals more to women than to men. Ever since I found his twitter it kills me to watch him though. He makes rape jokes- the fuck dude.

Manuel Ferrera though. GOOD LAWD. Manuel gets high marks from all the porn actresses he's worked with. [r/JamesDeen](http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesDeen/). Obviously, NSFW.

Most of the porn that James Deen makes appeals more to women than to men. As a man, I disagree. Seeing a woman in a porno clearly enjoying herself is a serious turn-on.  Ok, here's what I've been looking for and unable to find: A subreddit that is the equivalent of /r/nsfw, but with naked dudes instead of naked chicks. Something like /r/malemodels but with more penises, essentially.   I thought that there was one, but then i couldn't find it when I wanted it.

I'm not much of a porn connoisseur, but I appreciate some from time to time.  But yeah, a lot of it is all about women with GIANT boobies and no looking at the man at all. :S I understand the "No looking at man" part. It is so hard to find a porn with an attractive guy. Who actually has an attractive penis, not a "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?" penis. Who they actually show MORE then the hips/squeezed butt/penis. I've found that porn from other countries (especially germany) tend to have more attractive guys, and the guys seem to actually participate vocally a lot more.

I'd say leave the big talk stuff to her and your BF unless there's good reason not to, but there's no reason to shy away completely.  She might just be looking for reassurance that it's normal, but it could be more than that.  Is she uncomfortable, physically or about her appearance?  Is she interested in wearing a bra?

I was a bit of an early bloomer in that I had a terrible case of *the puffies* before I hit the double digits.  I did not have breasts until 12-13, mind you.

You just brought up memories that I haven't thought of in years. I had the puffies earlier than the other girls in my class, and when I told my mom that I needed a bra (it took me a looong time to summon up the courage), she told me that I wasn't old enough. I knew that I needed an extra layer, and I think a bunch of the other kids in my class knew it, too.       Oh the buds! I remember when mine appeared, one at a time. They hurt, at first and I felt like a complete weirdo. Did I have cancer? Was this normal? Why only one at a time?? No way in the world I'd ever had brought that up to my mother, a friend, or anyone, so kudos to you for having that kind of relationship with your bf's daughter. 

On the other hand, a little more discussion could make a big difference, so I'd try to bring it up after you discuss it with your b/f. It wouldn't hurt to give a recap to the mom, if you're on decent terms.

I'd just gotten my Paragard on the 4th, so I was pretty concerned when it was still bothering me this morning. (FTR: I checked my strings and they were still in place.)

I walked into my general physician's office first thing this morning. He did a brief examination and almost immediately told me to go to the ER to get a CT scan. He looked kind of terrified for me, so I immediately obeyed doctor's orders.

The ER doctor didn't think it was actually the IUD perforating, though. I had to lie in a hospital bed, wear a gown and sport an IV -- the whole shebang. They made me drink two huge cups of barium sulfate suspension and wait 90 minutes for it to work through me, then did the CT scan, which was strange. I had a very quick pelvic exam while we waited for the results, during which the doctor said the IUD appeared to be in place. During all of this, they put Toridol (sp?) in my IV, which never had much of an effect...

I saw my own scan and it freaked me out because my IUD was waaay off to the right. It turns out my uterus just lists to the starboard side. And that there's no perforation or anything. Nor did I have appendicitis or any other malady. It turns out I just have a VERY, VERY ANGRY UTERUS, which is rebelling against the Paragard.

So I'm okay and the IUD's doing what it's supposed to be doing (irritating the hell out of my uterine environment, hurrhurr) but if it doesn't calm down eventually, I'm obviously going to consider having it removed. I'm calling my OB/GYN on Monday and, if I'm still in pain then, it might have to come out then. If not, I'm hoping it's just an adjustment period and that my uterus will eventually come to terms with it.

In the meantime, I have a prescription for some heavy painkillers and I've been told to take it easy. So I'm surfing Reddit, in the hopes of sharing my experience with those of you who have IUDs or who are considering getting one. Here's proof that you can have some pretty gnarly symptoms but that it doesn't mean it's necessarily anything as serious as a perforation. Always, always pay attention to your body's signals! But, hopefully, if it happened to me, it makes it less likely for it to happen to you, right? :)

TL;DR: This is what I get for naming my IUD *T-Pain*.

Edit: I wanted to edit and add that this pain feels nothing like a cramp. It's like terrible gas pain that just can't be, well, expressed. I've gone to the bathroom several times (including the time when the barium sulfate pretty much made me shit my pants) and it has no effect on the pain... other than the fact that having a full bladder hurts more, presumably because it's pressing on my tender womb. &amp;lt;-- Sounds like a line from a romance novel, doesn't it?

UPDATE: Wow, thank-you for all the responses of support and commiseration. I took 100mg of Ultram at 6:00 and passed out cold. I just woke up a while ago and saw these. I intend to reply to each and every one of you but I just took another 100mg, so I'll get as many done as I can before I pass out again and get to the rest of you later. Thanks again! It made me feel better, especially while I was sitting on the toilet (thank-you, barium sulfate). :)  The same thing happened with my Paragard so I switched to a Mirena and never looked back (1 year on Paragard, 3 years on Mirena). A lot of people have serious issues with Mirena though, so do research if you look into switching. My only issue has been acne, but washing my face with coconut oil has kept my skin clear. Can I ask what you mean by

&amp;gt;washing my face with coconut oil has kept my skin clear.

Do you have, like, a recipe...? It's kind of a fad at the moment to use oils, but I never got around to it because [it sounds really extensive](http://www.theoilcleansingmethod.com/) and I'm very lazy. Two types of oil? Essential oils? Ain't nobody got time for that! But my face was both very dry and broken-out from a recent water switch so I figured I may as well try [Vatika enhanced coconut oil](http://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Coconut-150ml-Count/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361072714&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=vatika+oil) which I also use as a hair mask.

I didn't expect good results because it also has henna and lemon and some other ingredients and I think you're supposed to use pure oil, but I've been on it for two weeks and my skin is better than it's ever been. Here's what I do:

* Squeeze bottle and dig out between and nickel and quarter-size amount. put it in the palm of my hand until it melts. 

* Using clean fingers rub it into the skin on my face with circular motions until my entire face is covered. Massage into skin for about a minute. 

* Now wash hands with water and soap (just to make things easier). Grab a small facial towel and drench it in piping hot water from the tap. Wring it out, then fold it to keep it warm and apply it all over your face. You want to hold it on your skin to heat up the oil and then do a "sponge-off" motion. This will get the excess oil off. You might need to re-wet/re-wring the towel a couple of times.

I can't promise anything but this has been amazing for me. I was on Accutane twice and nothing had worked (The Method, Proactiv, Retinoids) as well as this has. I'm now only using concealer under my eyes and I dust very lightly with powder because I like the matte look, but I no longer feel like I have to wear foundation to be presentable.

Edit: I should note, apart from this I only use [St Ives Peach Scrub](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=349648&amp;amp;catid=182914&amp;amp;aid=338666&amp;amp;aparam=goobase_filler) in the shower. This is also an essential item; it's the only gentle facial scrub I've used where I don't have residual dirt on my skin afterwards. I used to use benzoyl peroxide creams but now I don't need them. Do you remove your make up before using the coconut oil? The same thing happened with my Paragard so I switched to a Mirena and never looked back (1 year on Paragard, 3 years on Mirena). A lot of people have serious issues with Mirena though, so do research if you look into switching. My only issue has been acne, but washing my face with coconut oil has kept my skin clear. That was another reason I posted this: I wanted to know if anyone had experienced the same thing. Thanks for sharing your story.

I am not opposed to trying Mirena, though I was extremely happy to remove hormones from my life completely. Assuming you initially chose the copper IUD for similar reasons, did you have reservations about having to switch? I'm glad it worked out well for you. My doctor told me I should get Mirena first, because far more women that she gives the Paraguard to have it removed than decide to keep it. Like, more than 70%! She said most keep the Mirena. 

My Mirena did hurt pretty bad for the first 2 months, though. First, avoid caffeine. Second, stay warm! ALWAYS have a jacket with you. The second you feel a twinge put it on. Even a light breeze can trigger major cramping.

My Mirena cramps went away and now I'm super happy with it.

. my period is disappearing  
. no more cramps  
. most effective bc (even more than the paraguard) I'm really curious: why avoid caffeine? http://www.livestrong.com/article/518327-is-caffeine-bad-for-menstrual-cramps/ That was another reason I posted this: I wanted to know if anyone had experienced the same thing. Thanks for sharing your story.

Assuming you initially chose the copper IUD for similar reasons, did you have reservations about having to switch? I'm glad it worked out well for you. I was concerned about blood clots, which is why I initially went hormone-free, however the doctor who removed the Paragard informed me that Progesterone-only birth control carries much lower risks. It's still a concern if you have a family history, but I don't so I should be fine. I used to suffer from very bad PMS and it's helped with that and I haven't had a period in three years which has been amazing, as they used to last 9 days. I can't say I've had any of the problems others have had, but I do come across those threads pretty frequently. I can't tell if it's like any other medication though, with a vocal minority who have strong adverse effects.

Best of luck with whichever way you decide to go. Do you have factor V Leiden perchance?  Do you have factor V Leiden perchance?

Assuming you initially chose the copper IUD for similar reasons, did you have reservations about having to switch? I'm glad it worked out well for you. I started with paragard hoping to eliminate hormone birth control, between acne, moodiness, and other symptoms I just never liked the pill and always felt a little 'off' using it. I lasted about 6 months before I switched to Mirena. The bleeding and general discomfort just got to be too much for me.  I literally had a heavy flow for about two weeks then  a week of heavy spotting and maybe one week free of bleeding. It worked great as a birth control seeing as I never wanted to have sex due to all the bloodiness. I've been on Mirena for about 18 months now and it's wonderful. No hormone symptoms, no more ovarian cysts, and extremely light 3 day periods.   The same thing happened with my Paragard so I switched to a Mirena and never looked back (1 year on Paragard, 3 years on Mirena). A lot of people have serious issues with Mirena though, so do research if you look into switching. My only issue has been acne, but washing my face with coconut oil has kept my skin clear. Do you use some specific product with coconut oil? I'm having the same acne problem and nothing I've tried has fixed it (I used to have very clear skin, and now I get new zits every day or so). I wrote out my method [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18noet/so_my_iud_landed_me_in_the_er_today/c8gieco). It's also good for balancing out dryness. :) The same thing happened with my Paragard so I switched to a Mirena and never looked back (1 year on Paragard, 3 years on Mirena).

Just as an FYI, coconut oil can be [comedogenic]( http://crunchybetty.com/community/discussion/129/coconut-oil-on-the-face...comedogenics/p1) and cause blocked pores.  /r/naturalbeauty has some great recommendations for using the Oil Cleansing Method.   &amp;gt;This is what I get for naming my IUD T-Pain.

I died.  I'm really sorry that happened to you. Feel better! I never had a Paraguard, I've got the Flexi-T IUD (copper, non-hormonal, just littler than the paraguard). My doctor recommended it because apparently I'm little, and it's the smallest one there is (actually, I had to travel to Canada to get it, because for some silly reason it's not available in the US, though it's apparently the IUD of choice in Canada and the whole of europe). It's worked great for me, and I never had a problem with it.  However, my friend just got the Paraguard and although she's not had the same experience as you, she's still been pretty ouchy and sad. :( 

I hope you feel better soon!  Wait, what?  How did you get it in Canada?  Can I go get one willy nilly after a quick border crossing?  It turns out that I have a "short" uterus (goes along with the rest of me, I guess) and neither the paraguard nor mirena worked for me. Actually, yeah! I did do a quick trip up to Canada. This absolutely wonderful women's health clinic was more than happy to see me. They were incredibly nice and wonderfully accommodating. Although they would have been absolutely happy to put it in for me (they tut-tutted about the American health care system) I just bought it and brought it back to the states for my doctor to put it in, since she knows me best. (Obviously, don't accidentally puncture the packaging to keep it sterile). My doctor had worked elsewhere and put a few Flexi-T's in before so she was fine doing it. 

The crazy thing is, it was SO MUCH CHEAPER even to buy it full cost in Canada. They were *so* apologetic that I was going to have to pay for the visit because I was not a Canadian citizen. But the doctor's appointment was only $45, (they have to have a doctor actually talk to you to give you a Canadian prescription - an American doctor's prescription won't do you any good) and the IUD was only about $130 something. Add in even the cost of the short trip up to Victoria and I still didn't even break $400 - which is *STILL* less than what the Paraguard would have cost me here. When I have to replace this one, I am *definitely* going back to Canada - there's no way I'm going to have a beast like Paraguard put in.

TLDR; I will be doing all my IUD-ing in Canada. I'm really sorry that happened to you. Feel better! I never had a Paraguard, I've got the Flexi-T IUD (copper, non-hormonal, just littler than the paraguard). My doctor recommended it because apparently I'm little, and it's the smallest one there is (actually, I had to travel to Canada to get it, because for some silly reason it's not available in the US, though it's apparently the IUD of choice in Canada and the whole of europe).

However, my friend just got the Paraguard and although she's not had the same experience as you, she's still been pretty ouchy and sad. :( 

I hope you feel better soon!  oh my god, i'm so excited to hear about the flexi-T! have you had any negative long-lasting side effects? i can't really do hormones but i really want an IUD... but my cramps are bad enough as it is, i don't think i could deal with paraguard's common side effects :( Well, I was on the nuva ring before switching, so it took my body a while to re-adjust to not having the hormone in my system, so I had pretty annoying acne for about 6 months. But I think that was a side effect of going off of hormones. 

Otherwise, it is still an IUD even though it's smaller, so I do get cramps worse than I did on nuva ring, but to me it seems to be more or less back to where it was back in high school (I pretty much never had cramps on the nuva ring). Similarly, I do have longer periods. Instead of 3-days on nuva I have about 5-6 days, but then I've also been having more days between periods too.

All in all though, I wouldn't trade it for anything. A little bit longer periods and having to keep Midol in my purse for occasional cramps is *SO* worth it to me. I hated having hormonal birth control. It made me crazy and slowly ate away at my libido over the years until there was nothing left. The Flexi-T was totally problem-free from the beginning. Some normal cramping the day it went in, but by the next day I was at work in a field site with no problems whatsoever. I felt absolutely great. No spotting, no misery, totally fine. 100% recommend. I've heard so many horrible things from friends and others adjusting to the Paraguard that I'm so thankful my doctor suggested the road trip! thanks so much for the information!! my period lasts around five days right now anyway but with the divacup, length doesn't bother me at all, so i was mainly worried about the cramping. gah, when i'm in a place to get an IUD, i'm totally gonna ask about the flexi-T :)  I'm really sorry that happened to you. Feel better! I never had a Paraguard, I've got the Flexi-T IUD (copper, non-hormonal, just littler than the paraguard).

However, my friend just got the Paraguard and although she's not had the same experience as you, she's still been pretty ouchy and sad. :( 

I hope you feel better soon!   I have the Mirena and while it did hurt for a few weeks (about 2) and acted up during my first year of periods, it has been better then other birth controls for me. Now that I've had it awhile I don't get any side effects. No periods either! I've tried tons of other types and this was the best, for me at least. Good luck with yours!   I feel your pain. I got my Mirena a couple years ago and the insertion was by FAR the most painful experience of my life even though I took medication to dilate my cervix.

I had severe cramping to the point where I had to go home from work a couple times and sex wasn't possible. It took a couple months to finally calm down. Turns out I just have a really tiny uterus which was probably the issue. I admit, considering how difficult getting it was, I have a lot of anxiety about getting it out again :(

That being said - MY EXPERIENCE IS ATYPICAL!! I'm just sympathizing with the OP, NOT trying to discourage anyone from getting an IUD! They are wonderful, effective, and usually not uncomfortable at all.  i'm tagging you as 'has an angry uterus'

unless you'd prefer 'has a tender womb'?  The first month with my Paragard was awful. I'm now in month two and its much easier. Much. 

My "cramps" were so bad that Oxycodone didn't even help.  Just went to the GYN a week ago to have the strings checked and everything is fine. She said to expect the first few months to be bad, but get progressively easier.

Take a look in r/sex and r/askwomen for more info I came here to say this exact thing!

I was all crampy and weird the first month but this second month has been a breeze. I had the worst cramps ever in the few days before my first period after insertion and they actually got better for me once the period started. 
  Could you be allergic to copper?    &amp;gt; It turns out my uterus just lists to the starboard side

That line gave me a great laugh, but seriously..ouch! What a painful introduction for your tender womb. I've thought seriously about IUDs, but the fear of painful expulsion or PID has kept me rooted on hormonal birth control. Not to say there aren't risks and downsides associated with that route either.

Good luck, wSw! I hope you get to feeling better soon and that the uterine rebellion of 2013 is put down in short order.  I just got my Mirena four days ago and have been experiencing a lot of cramping and general shitty feelings, so I've been Googling it like crazy to make sure everything is okay. Thanks for sharing.

Your TL;DR is hilarious and I hope you are feeling better soon! I just got my Mirena four days ago and have been experiencing a lot of cramping and general shitty feelings, so I've been Googling it like crazy to make sure everything is okay. Thanks for sharing.

Your TL;DR is hilarious and I hope you are feeling better soon!  Thank you for posting this! I'm about to get one and I'ma little nervous because I've heard horror stories from friends whose uteruses (uteri?) pretty much rejected the IUD and they had to get it taken out. I love the NuvaRing, which I'm on now, but my insurance company covers the IUD with no copay, so I figured it's worth a shot if I can get BC that will last for 5 years with little to no hassle/maintenance. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that my uterus plays well with others. :) Thank you for posting this!

I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that my uterus plays well with others. :)  Paragard is notorious for extra pain. I got mine in November and have had residual pain ever since - gas pain, random cramps and whenever I need to use the bathroom. That's expected. Your uterus is pissed there's a foreign object in it and it's trying to protect you. Womb and IUD are not good buddies as of yet. Takes 3-6 months, I hear.

That being said, it sure beats being pregnant and I preferred the non-hormonal version so I readily accept the side effects.  that last part about the cramps is what my cramps feel like every month hahah Ugh, I can handle normal cramps but this pain is in a league of its own. I totally feel for you if this is a monthly occurrence. :( hah yeah basically why getting an iud is like really terrifying to me. i want one, but my cramps are so bad to begin with :/ The copper IUD (Paragard) can make cramps worse. That's what I have. But the hormonal one (Mirena) is supposed to help with cramps and even make your period disappear completely. :) I knowww, but the whole reason I stopped birth control pills was because I didn't like the hormonal side effects. I've been doing a lot of research and I'm hoping that if I get the copper IUD and take like B vitamins and zinc that the cramps won't be so bad so here's hoping! haha  I've had the worst symptoms with Paragard, and I've only had it for 2 months. It lowered my iron count so I am very faint-y all the time, and this morning my boyfriend accidentally bumped it during some rough sex, and I've been keeling over in pain all day. While it has helped my sex drive and overall made me less anxious, I can see how this thing isn't for everyone. Yuck. Do you plan to keep it despite all of this? I hadn't had any issues whatsoever until this paid suddenly flared up. I hope it doesn't last. I want to keep it, yeah. I'm hoping the gyno can check it and I can get on some iron supplements. I've heard the chance of something going amiss decreases with time, so I'm just going to attribute this to my body getting used to this foreign object.  I have had my copper IUD for 6 months now and love it. I did have some cramping and weird feelings for a few weeks but I attributed them to giving birth 6 weeks before I got it in. I've had none of the mood swings that I commonly had on hormonal bc pills. I've also finally been able to lose weight, though I'm sure part of that is my paleo diet too.  I had a similar issue! Holy cow. I would be sitting, and have this serious gas-like-strange pain in my lower region (too low for gas...)I woudl stand up, and it would hurt so bad that I bad that I had to sit down right away. I went on like this for a few days (read: a week and a half). When I would start crying because of this, my boyfriend forced me to go to PP where I got it put in. The strings were in place,all was fine and dandy....but it had slipped? She said it was now sitting too low. I then found out that my uterus was too small for them to put it in in the first place and am now out a shit ton of money &amp;gt;..&amp;gt;

Broke college kid problems.   Aw, I'm sorry you went through that and lost money, to boot. Maybe a smaller IUD will work for you? And lots of insurance plans cover these things nowadays. :) If only I had insurance.....I had to pay out of pocket and PP said they'd replace the device but wouldnt put it back in because im too small....they wont refund me. Which makes no sense if they're willing to replace the device. 

I'm struggling to get by month to month, another IUD is going to have to wait a while...Thanks for trying though!   I had a patient once who had to drink three CT Shakes. He struggled to get them down and then promptly threw them all up again. Than he had to drink three more. Poor guy.   I'm glad they gave you painkillers!  I also had an intense reaction to the Paragard. The first month after insertion went fine, just some cramping on and off. However, when I got my first period with it, I was sure it had perfed because of how painful it was. I have never felt that much pain in my life. Luckily (sort of) I was recovering from a tonsillectomy at the time and they already had me on hydrocodone. I don't think I would have survived without it.

After my period was over my uterus decided that it needed to get rid of the IUD in the only way it knew how: contractions. I was in disbelief when my gyno said that my uterus was literally trying to birth the damn thing haha. Thankfully, it calmed down after awhile. I've now had it for two years and after the first six months the pains went away almost entirely.

The most disappointing thing about the whole experience was that while I was being checked for perforation/correct placement etc. they discovered that I have a septate uterus. Basically that means that there is a line of tougher tissue running down the middle of my uterus, dividing it. This sort of defect occurs on a spectrum. Some women just have a small septum while others have a uterus that is divided into two parts completely. The problem is that an irregularly-shaped uterus can reduce the effectiveness of the Paragard. So much, in fact, that it isn't recommended as a bc method at all. The doctors say they can't tell how severe my septum is without removing the IUD first. However, they advised that it should not be relied upon as a primary method and that I should have it taken out and pursue a different form of bc. This was very aggravating as the whole reason I got the damn thing in the first place is that I react very badly to anything with hormones. Basically the only options I have left are condoms or a diaphragm. I don't know why they didn't do an ultrasound on me before insertion, or if it's common practice to do that, but it could have saved me a lot of money (and agony) if they had. So, if you're planning on getting an IUD make sure they check your uterus first, or you might suffer through the pain and inconvenience of insertion/removal all for naught! Not to mention the price tag...

As of now I just use condoms as a primary method. I haven't had the Paragard removed because it gives me a little peace of mind as a secondary method. I'm seeing a new gyno soon and I'm hoping she will have some suggestions as to what I can do. 


Tl;dr: If you are considering getting an IUD make sure an ultrasound is done on your uterus beforehand to check whether or not it's suitable for one (i.e. isn't bicornuate, doesn't contain a septum, etc.) Wow, I've never heard of that. Was this not something they would've noticed during the initial insertion? (I wondered why my doctors never mentioned that my uterus was so far off to the right.) Does this affect fertility? I don't think I have this condition but now I'm curious... Apparently it isn't typically able to be seen during a regular pelvic exam. Unless the defect has also caused the vagina to become separated into two passageways, so to speak, it isn't something that's routinely checked for.

Depending on the severity of the defect, it can affect fertility. From what I understand, the embryo cannot implant on the septum itself, which lowers the rate of conception in general. It is possible to have the septum removed surgically in some cases (which could improve fertility) but apparently it can grow back (?!). I'm pretty stunned that an ultrasound isn't routine procedure before an insertion considering the potential risks involved.   I have the Paragard for 4 years now. First year was almost exactly like you described, I thought something was horribly wrong. I remember sitting at my desk at work and feeling this intense pain and thinking I would throw up, pass out, or both. I went back to my doctor and he recommended Mirena but I'm scared of hormones, they ruin my sex drive, make me break out, gain weight, etc.

Stuck with the Paragard and it's not nearly as bad as it was in the first 6 months I had it. Still, I probably would have had it yanked out back then if I had a better alternative that wasn't yucky foam, hormones, or condoms. Now I have to say I'm glad I did it - still have a sex drive, cramps are not as bad (although I still do have them - just take ibuprofen at the first twinge which seems to take care of it). I'm in my early 40's which might make a difference as well.   IUDs = painful periods + external endometriosis = adhesions
 What is external endometriosis? D: Cells from the uterus lining are ejected into the abdomen, possibly by strong contractions. They adhere to intestines and other abdominal structures. They continue to react to hormonal cycles and becomes inflamed during ones period. Over time this can cause adhesions, sort of glueing together organs that were never meant to be attached. This causes pain and can disrupt normal intestinal function. Give it a Google. Do you have this? :( Sounds horrible. It was. Copper 7 IUD for 4 years. Terrible cramping. External endometriosis for 15 years. More cramping and back aches. Thank heavens for Advil and heating pads. Menopause was the cure.  My Paraguard had to be removed in the ER, like, 36 hours after insertion.  I was in horrible, horrible pain and my temperature started to rise.  I called in to the ER twice and the second time they said to come in.  My IUD was rejecting.  Having it inserted was terribly painful, the 36 hours I had it in was so painful I spent most of them writhing around in pain, and even after some morphine the removal was horrid too.  No more IUDs for me.   I heard that most perforations actually happen at the time of insertion. Was this what happened or was your body just absolutely not having it? In any case, I'm really sorry you had to go through that.

What do use now instead? No perforation, just a small, intolerant uterus.  I'm back on the birth control pills now.  I've been on them for nearly 8 years and I kind of wanted to give my body a break, but Paraguard and I are just not compatible!  I got my paragaurd last week and I found some heavy weight lifting helped settle it down. Opposite of what your doc suggests, but maybe keep it in mind. Also I had my appendix out which had a horrible gas pain going across my lower abdomen, so you might also consider that.  Your sense of humor though this whole thing? I love it. Hope all goes well for you and the IUD!  I misread this as IED (improvised explosive device) and thought, hmm how odd.  Same thing happened to me (uterus throwing an epic tantrum in response to Paragard). I stuck it out for ~3 months, but it never got better. Ended up having it removed.

I never really found a replacement I'm completely satisfied with since any type of hormonal birth control messes with my moods too much.  I had some sharp pains on the right side about a week after getting Mirena. They weren't constant, but I went to the OB. She didn't think it was a perforation because the pain wasn't constant, but did a transvaginal ultrasound to make sure. Turns out it was because I was ovulating. I was on Nuvaring before switching, and she said I probably didn't ovulate, and for some reason this little eggy grew some mass to 2-3mm and was stuck in my Fallopian tube. Some Ibuprofen and a couple of weeks later it was reabsorbed.  Sounds familiar.  I had Paraguard for about a year.  I had excruciating pain during the insertion and a lot of cramping and intermittent sharp pain for awhile afterwards.  It did eventually go away, but within a year, my uterus pushed it halfway out in a fit of cramping.  I had to make an emergency appointment to PP to get them to pull it the rest of the way out.  It was disappointing as I was enjoying the idea of hormone-free BC.  The doctors have told me that I'm not allowed another IUD until I've had a baby help make some more room.   I had Paragard placed in June 2012 and had major pain as well. I saw my obgyn about it and had an ultrasound to make sure everything looked okay with the IUD and everything else (which it did). 

She offered to remove it due to the pain, but I am unable to handle the hormones in other forms of birth control, so I decided to stick with it. I've always had very bad cramping, so I deal. 

While the pain was much worse for the first 3-4 months, it has improved. I plan on keeping it until I no longer want or need birth control (or ten years, whichever comes first lol). It should get better!   I've got a copper non-hormonal IUD as well, and it was hellish adjusting to it.  It took about a month of uterine free-for-all, but after that it calmed right down.  Regular periods, a little more painful than they were, a little more spotting, but on the whole, it's just fine.  Having a foreign body in your uterus sucks. I concur.

Source: 3 babies Is it really foreign if it started there though? Is it really foreign if it started there though? Having a foreign body in your uterus sucks.  Mirena is awesome, I had some pretty bad pains at first as well because what happens when you put the IUD in is your body tries to reject it. The IUD is something unnatural in your uterus that your body isn't accustomed to and it HURTS when it tries to reject it from your body make no mistake but I've had mine for a couple years now and it's fantastic, no side effects whatsoever. My periods were hugely reduced, my pain was reduced and it has been nothing but good to me. Give it time!  Yikes!

Really I have nothing to add here. I'm just glad you're in good spirits and I hope you feel better soon.  I feel your pain! For the first week or so after I got my iud (mirena) I was in extreme pain. It sucked so bad! But it's so worth it!  I love how your TL;DR tells so little but so much at the same time.  I now have you tagged as 'Named her IUD T-Pain.' IT'S A RED RES TAG.

It's horror stories like this that also made me choose an implant over an IUD. I'm not as ballsy as you, walkSMASHwalk.   Make sure to take some Ibuprofen if you're not already. Not for the pain, but because it reduces muscle swelling and will make your uterus calm down a bit.   Your description of the pain is exactly how I get.  I'm getting mine removed on the 25th. Sorry to hear this! :( Thanks!  We're gonna be trying for a baby before too long, so it's all good.  Sucks about IUD, but felt guilty about the length of time I spent laughing at T-Pain  I've had Paraguard almost 3 years now. At first the pain was very, very bad. It was like the worst cramps I'd had x 100. Eventually the cumulative time I spent each month in pain and the severity of the pain lessened. I now find it tolerable. Every once in a while though it's like my body still tries to fight it. When it's hurting it seems like doing crunches, twisting/turning, jogging, or anything that jars it around makes it worse.   That sounds so miserable. I am so sorry that happened. 

I had my IUD inserted about 8 months ago. For the 1st 3 months, off and on, I had some pain like you're describing. It eventually got to be less and less, and I haven't had it in months now. I dealt with it, but everyone is different. I said this so you'll know you aren't alone. Mine was never bad enough to make me go to the ER, but I just wanted you to know it might go away for you. I hope it does go away.   Toradol!  Generic name : Ketorolac, an NSAID pain reliever.

The ER were I work uses **alot** of that stuff.  Aha, glad to see I'm not the only one. I haven't had to go to the ER, but my stomach hurts often after the insertion. I think it's being mean to me. I hope it calms down soon. (I had a check-up meeting a few days ago: the thing was in place, everything fine).

PS your first doc might have seen someone else who had a wandering iud, hence his/her advice to go to the ER. I'm glad you're (relatively) okay though!  My general physician was just really worried for me and I totally understand. Although I wouldn't have gone directly to the ER (obviously, heh), I knew it could be serious and I'd rather be safe than sorry. I'm glad I had it checked out, though I may cringe a little when the bill comes...

And by the tune of this thread, I'd definitely say you and I are not alone! It's not the funnest club to be in but... :P Here's hoping to our uteri calming down!   When I got my Paragard I had terrible pain (not cramps, PAIN) and was assured that it was "normal" and that it would lessen over time and eventually be ok. I eventually had a fit and made them check on mine. It was gone. Couldn't find it on an ultrasound. I ended up having exploratory surgery to locate and remove it. It had migrated out of my uterus and attached itself to my bowel. I STILL have pain and it has been 3 months since I had it removed. I will never have another IUD. I found it quite amusing that my Dr. actually asked me if I wanted her to order a new one for me. Umm... NO. 
  I found a post from a woman with a paragard who said natural progesterone really helps with her cramps. That might be an option for you, but it's better to not be dependent on supplements for the next 10 years...  As in, taken as a supplement? I'm so wary of hormones. I know it was synthetic hormones that made me go crazy but, well, to be honest, I don't like taking any sort of medications or putting anything foreign into my body unless I have to. I mean, it took two doctors to get my IUD in and two to get my IV to work in the ER. My body's like, "NOPE." :P All the natural health authors agree that there is a huge difference between the xeno-hormones in birth control and a non-prescription bio-identical progesterone USP supplement. Birth control helps the body forget to make enough progesterone, while supplemental Progesterone USP helps the body correct its progesterone deficit. 

Birth control defenders seem to think that "birth control may not be perfect, but it's the best we've got", but this is not at all true. A certain Progesterone USP formula can be used as a contraceptive, "in theory", but no one's spent the $millions required to prove that it is indeed effective at preventing babies. So women get fake hormones instead. 

The other option is supplemental iodine, but the IUD will probably have to go without a progesterone supplement. 
  These types of stories scare me so much, because I plan on hopefully getting Paragard in a few weeks.  I don't have any advice, but I wanted to say that your general humor and attitude is amazing. This isn't a funny situation but your tl;dr cracked me up. It makes me feel good that people like you exist.

Best of luck, hugs.</snippet></document><document><title>Crisis in confidence...how do I handle adult bullying? </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ofqn/crisis_in_confidencehow_do_i_handle_adult_bullying/</url><snippet>I just started medical school not too long ago. It's a struggle to keep up with the amount of material that is thrown at us, but with a lot of hard work everyday, I'm able to stay on top of it. 

The trouble is this: I live in a dorm, and the women next door to me (who are nice to my face) have incredibly loud voices. Every night they gossip about other students in the class, and every night my name inevitably comes up as someone who they believe is not smart enough to make it through medical school because "I am too old to retain" the material. I am 6 years older than them! If I didn't have to listen to them through the walls every evening, it wouldn't be an issue to me. Trouble is, after several weeks of hearing this almost nightly, it is starting to chip away at my self-confidence which is inevitably effecting my studying. It's also pretty hurtful. At this point, it feels patronizing when they are nice to my face.

How can I tactfully stop these women from bullying me through the walls at night? I ask because in my frustration with them, the only solutions that come to mind would be effective, but less than tactful or appropriate.   Just tell them the walls are thin in the dorms and its easy to hear everything. As a fellow med student, I understand, and you know what I realized? The people who act like that don't end up making the cut. Congrats on your hard work!   I would listen to these two about things you can do to get them to stop. I find just being honest about my dislike for people tends to get them to leave me alone, (such as 'I can hear you at night, and as you don't expect me to be here long, I don't see why you bother being nice to me).  
  
Another thing I recommend though if it's causing you issue sleeping is to get a fan. When I lived in the dorms I had some people in the dorm next to me that got really loud at night. My roommate at the time started turning the fan on at night and I went from being able to make out full conversations, to not even noticing the noise at all. Turn this on and drown out those words. They clearly aren't nice or intelligent women and you don't need to waste your nights listening to them- especially if your RA fails to get them to quiet down.  The fan is an EXCELLENT idea!  If you want something that isn't blowing air around, I highly recommend the Sleep Mate. You can find it on amazon. Its a little pricey, but they are very long lasting. My mom has had one for over 20 years, and I have had mine for 6. Its awesome (just white noise).

As an aside, I am an older returning student in a medical school (health professions, not MD) and I have found that I am a MUCH better student at 31 than I was at 21.

They're trying to undermine your confidence by deliberately talking loudly enough about you so as for you to overhear. They're jealous, and trying to sabotage you. Don't give them the satisfaction of getting to you. 

I recommend you tell them what Phosphate-3 recommended, and then take up caikoran's good advice and get a fan. Sleep well at night knowing that while you're working hard, they're depriving themselves of sleep and energy by being negative gossips. You'll pass with flying colors, and they'll be lucky if they make it through the next couple of semesters.

Best of luck to you!   If you're in a dorm, you've got an RA. Ask them for help resolving the situation.     </snippet></document><document><title>[IFF] Gender roles for kids.</title><url>http://imgur.com/a/tES7p</url><snippet>  And here I was hoping that this was the same book, skinned differently for boys and girls (because I remember working in a library in the children's department and how some kids can get if they think they're reading "a book for girls - icky!") 

Someone should do that. Write the same book, skin it differently, and make it all okay! Because really, dealing with the opposite gender, friends, toys, explosions, adventures, and secret codes is stuff both boys and girls enjoy... Or, if someone wants to go through the trouble, we could all buy up copies of both books, switch the covers, and sneak them back into bookstores- reminiscent of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc8qcZ7iMbY).  I'm sure that the books' contents are going to be laced with exactly the same kind of information and stereotyping as the cover. That's why it's funny to switch them.

I identified with all the "boy" stuff and hated all the "girl" stuff.  Am I gay?  Transgendered?  Or are your ideas about girliness just full of shit? &amp;gt;Or are your ideas about girliness just full of shit?

Bingo. Why are things like dolls, baby animals, cooking, the color pink, (so on and so on in the list of random shit) thought of as intrinsically "girly"? Anytime somebody tries to explain it through fucking evolutionary psychology I feel like my head will explode. No, sorry, it's because WE **SAY** IT'S GIRLY. We apply that quality, and *then* we make it seem like it's lesser to "boyish" things. Shit like this is why I was so confused as a kid.  I identified with all the "boy" stuff and hated all the "girl" stuff.  Am I gay?  Transgendered?  Or are your ideas about girliness just full of shit? I was exactly the same! Because of all the "feminine" bullshit all my female friends were into I thought I was supposed to be a boy. I liked shorter hair, the color blue, "experiments", video games, and action figures. I had no idea what was wrong with me(I realize now that it was nothing). This gender roles buckshot makes me so mad because one day when I have a child ill never want him or her to feel this way. 
 Especially because the "values" they're saying are feminine aren't even traditionally feminine!!

Shopping??  Wtf? Especially because the "values" they're saying are feminine aren't even traditionally feminine!!

 I had the same experience... I went through a phase after I first learned about people being transgender where I seriously questioned whether I was a girl or not. Now it seems silly to me because I love being a girl (except for four days a month), but I was getting to the point where I was going to talk to my parents and admit I felt more like a boy than a girl... *just* because I fit more male gender roles as a kid.

They even get 2 more chapters! And "Boys" is the first chapter? BAH. And he spends 43 pages on boys.

    the world is doomed.  As a woman in Chemistry, this is something I fucking hated about my childhood. This mindset is all over the place, unfortunately.

*OH COME ON*. And "gross stuff" could have been cool like bugs or bacteria or something. ughhh I think that this may be one of the main reasons for the big gender gap in the STEM fields. Boys' interest in this stuff is encouraged from childhood on and they are learning basic scientific thinking at a very young age. Many paedagogic studies came to the conclusion that the promotion of children has a big influence on their developement later in life, maybe that's why so many Maths or Chemistry teachers I met seriously believe that girls simply don't possess the same scientific intelligence as boys. Of course that's rubbish. It's just that our analytic thinking skills haven't been encouraged at a young age the same way as boys', and this influences our whole life. I'm curious, do you think gender-specific science kits influence this too? I've seen things like "grossology" kits in all blue marketed to boys sitting next to all pink "perfumology" kits marketed to girls. I'm curious, do you think gender-specific science kits influence this too? I've seen things like "grossology" kits in all blue marketed to boys sitting next to all pink "perfumology" kits marketed to girls. I actually had one of those perfumology kits, and I'm a in a STEM field! My opinion is that the issue is less that there are gender-specific kits in general, but that there are so few girl's kits compared to boy's kits. The fact that there still exists such a gender bias is still an issue, but even with gender specific kits girls are at least being *exposed* to science. Unfortunatley, we are still not encouraging girls to investigate STEM subjects as much as we are doing so for boys. Frankley, in my opinion, all kids ought to be exposed to more of it and at an earlier age. I'm curious, do you think gender-specific science kits influence this too? I've seen things like "grossology" kits in all blue marketed to boys sitting next to all pink "perfumology" kits marketed to girls. What I've always been curious about is why we are marketed cosmetic and perfume creation until it's time to make money and win prizes with our creativity - [Then it's usually the men who get the accolades](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/perfumer-jean-claude-ellena-discusses-the-life-of-a-nose-a-855685.html). I get the feeling that women have to be twice as good as men to be taken seriously in those fields.

It's the same damn thing with cooking. It's all "get in the damn kitchen" until it's time for the rosettes to be distributed, then men are all over that shit.

The girl book is full of activities that involve friends and sharing of thoughts and feelings. Nothing like that in the boys book. The only thing that comes close to encouraging communication is the "slang" section. 

It's just as sad to me that communication about feelings is a "girl" thing as the fact that the girl book has an entire chapter about boys. I suppose if they put a girls chapter in the boys book they might actually end up talking about emotions and god forbid we have that in our explosions loving, weapons slinging, slang speaking boys....

  I absolutely cannot understand how books like this still get published in 2013. I work at a kids book store and the author has a whole bunch of these, he also has "pocket doodles for boys" and "pocket doodles for princesses", a guide to mischief and a few more. I flipped through the boy/girl books the OP pictured and they really are horrible. I showed my female boss and she put them both behind the counter &amp;amp; hasn't sold them or even put them out on the floor yet. I absolutely cannot understand how books like this still get published in 2013. I absolutely cannot understand how books like this still get published in 2013. Gender norms are still going strong. I just learned that I am suppose to let women board and get off elevators first. What is this!? Just board in the order of the que! No, screw that.  Efficiency should be what governs who gets off when.  I can open my own door too. Apparently a coworker of mine will keep his car doors locked until he gets to the car so his female companions can't open themselves when they are closer to the car than him. We live in a bizarre world.  That's actually kind of a creepy level of control... seems like a characteristic someone would remember about an abuser or serial killer.. just sayin'. Gender norms are still going strong. I just learned that I am suppose to let women board and get off elevators first. What is this!? Just board in the order of the que! Wait...who exactly did you learn *that* nonsense from? Did some entitled woman or man explicitly say that was the "rule"? Because I would laugh in their face. I try to be nice to people no matter what their gender is. I open doors for everyone, try to give people the right of way, common courtesy-type shit. Why make it about gender?  Gender norms are still going strong. I just learned that I am suppose to let women board and get off elevators first. What is this!? Just board in the order of the que! I absolutely cannot understand how books like this still get published in 2013.  Seems to me like the boys' book is the "kids" book and the girls' book is the "pre-teen/tween" book... which is a little worrying. 

I also don't see why we have to keep ring-fencing gendered activities and interests for kids. When I was a kid, I was a total tomboy (I passed as male 80% of the time outside school until boobs. Fuck you, puberty.), and because I'd been taught the binary opposition of girl/boy, pink/blue, it took me a long time to unlearn that "girly" wasn't less valid. 

Now, I have young cousins who are boys, but don't like rough sports or gross stuff. They play happily with their female relatives, whether it's dolls or cars or tree-climbing, and they are way less judgemental about girls vs. boys than my peers were at that age. 

It sucks to see that this stuff is still getting churned out, but I'd like to think that, just maybe, attitudes really are changing in spite of it. &amp;gt;I passed as a boy.... Until boobs. Fuck you puberty.

I think you still have issues with identifying girls as 'less valid.'

 I don't understand why everyone here thinks guys interests are so much better than girls. I love football and video games, but I don't want to be 'one of the guys.' 

And I would love I I had a book that that taught me how to do make up when I was younger, instead I thought, like you, doing some girly things suck, so they all must suck. I refused makeup until I was about 16, 17. Even though I always wanted to try it I didn't want to be labeled a 'girly girl.' 

Now I am 21, and have no idea what I am doing[with make up], all because I thought doing girl things were terrible. They aren't. There I nothing wrong with girl things. So what if I like cooking, and baking, and make up, and sewing, and knitting. Why the fuck does that make me less valid then you, who apparently only likes guys stuff... &amp;gt;I passed as a boy.... Until boobs. Fuck you puberty.

 I don't understand why everyone here thinks guys interests are so much better than girls. I love football and video games, but I don't want to be 'one of the guys.' 

And I would love I I had a book that that taught me how to do make up when I was younger, instead I thought, like you, doing some girly things suck, so they all must suck. I refused makeup until I was about 16, 17. Even though I always wanted to try it I didn't want to be labeled a 'girly girl.' 

Now I am 21, and have no idea what I am doing[with make up], all because I thought doing girl things were terrible. They aren't. There I nothing wrong with girl things. So what if I like cooking, and baking, and make up, and sewing, and knitting. Why the fuck does that make me less valid then you, who apparently only likes guys stuff... &amp;gt;I passed as a boy.... Until boobs. Fuck you puberty.

&amp;gt; I love football

I judge everyone who says this, regardless of gender. It's not okay. It's not okay to like football? Not by my reckoning. I mean, not that I blame anyone individually for liking football; they are victims of the system. However, I'm certain that we'd be a far more intelligent society if we didn't appreciate team sports to the degree that we do. Sports like any social institution are a microcosm of the civilization they inhabit, so naturally they represent a place where violence reigns supreme, no intelligence is required for success, cruelty prevails and women are an underrepresented class. It's telling that most intelligent people do not like sports, and that the appreciation of them is always tasteless.  &amp;gt;I passed as a boy.... Until boobs. Fuck you puberty.

I saw this and went and dug out my copy of The Big Book of Girl Stuff, which was written by Bart King, the same author. The table of contents includes much more than this pocket guide. It included chapters called: "Ick!", "Practical Jokes", "Sports and Games", and "Humor", though my favorite was always "Girl Power". 

The author had his sisters help him make this book, as well as many female students. 

The chapter on boys talks a lot about how boys are expected to repress their emotions and how boys and girls are a lot alike. Most of it says to put your friends before boys and that you shouldn't worry about boys until you're over the age of 30. 

Just looking at the table of contents doesn't really you what the book is about. It is really quite empowering, encouraging girls to not worry about appearance or what others think but what makes them happy (especially in the chapters on makeup, beauty, and food and dieting). Is there a comparable section in the boys' version of that book where they talk about these things? I would think that if you're going to talk about how it's common for boys to repress their emotions, the people you should be telling that to are...BOYS. To me it just seems straight up weird if they're explaining stereotypes to only ONE gender. At the very least here should be a section in the boys' book about gender policing in a similar vein. Like "what you think as 'girly' is just a social construct." If there isn't, sorry, I think these books are kinda shitty in that sense.  Searched through the entire book and found something similar:

 "You think certain things are gross or beautiful because you've been taught they are"

"What you think is good-looking is probably what you have been taught is good-looking by our society"

"Think about who you are comparing yourself to. Are you putting yourself through a play-dough-not-so-fun-factory of beauty to look like something you're not?"

"Throughout history, people thought it was 'not proper' for girls or women to play sports. What a crock!"  I have a son who prefers pink, asks for Barbies for birthday presents, and loves playing princess dress up.  This goes both ways.  I know this is TwoX, but as unfair as this is to little girls, remember it is unfair to little boys too.  As mothers (those of us that are) we have to be sure that when we are encouraging our daughters not to be stuck in female gender roles, we are offering the same choice to our sons.  

No one really looks twice at my daughter if she wants to do a "boy" activity - play in the mud, join in a sport, carry around a Star Wars action figure instead of a baby doll, etc.  But my son gets laughed at frequently for wearing a pink sparkly belt, putting a bow in his hair, or carrying around a Barbie doll.  

Just sayin... it goes both ways.   Very true. As a mom of two boys who both went through a flexible gender stage, I found people's reactions even more sexist than I expected. It was basically why would anyone lucky enough to be born male WANT to be a girl??

As an aside, who decided that owls and cupcakes are for girls? My sons have both given up their skirts but they wear pajamas from the girl section because wtf who doesn't love owls and/or dessert foods?

Just sayin... it goes both ways.   The reason your son gets laughed at is because feminine traits and behaviors are seen as inferior. So while I agree it is a two way street, 'girl' is still the negative. I totally agree with you though and you seem like a great parent!

 This is a good point, and it honestly sucks. It seems like through women's liberation/feminist/etc. movements, it's been about emphasizing choice and plasticity for women, but at the same time, it's like the goal was to leave behind the stereotypically feminine characteristics, roles, and traits in favor of the masculine ones, which is problematic for *everybody*.

[Here](http://wild.psych.duke.edu/images/WilbournKee2010.pdf) is a pretty interesting study on children's perceptions of gender roles where they demonstrated that flexibility for men was much more narrowly perceived by children of both sexes. And their conclusions are along those lines - that it's because, while we've been encouraging girls to pursue stereotypically more "masculine" (emphasis on the STEREOTYPICALLY) roles, there's been a relative silence towards adding perceived value to stereotypically "feminine" ones, ultimately boxing in boys even more. It's really unfortunate, and I think underlines how overall damaging gender policing is. I personally just tend to get insulted as a woman because the things that are stereotypically attributed to me solely by my "sex" are negatively perceived, even if I *don't* pursue them. Nobody wins. 

EDIT: I can't verbs Why can't we begin to look at the value of both masculine and feminine traits? I personally love science, literature and learning, whilst valuing the art of communicating your feelings and articulating yourself on an intimate level. Then there's weapons which I don't appreciate so much, along with shopping, which...well, isn't that something we all *have* to do? Why is consumerism seen as an inherently feminine attribute? I've never really got that to be honest. I'm sure there are better ones such as compassion and understanding...

Just sayin... it goes both ways.    I thought this would be similar to the book I have, but it's not. I have ["The Daring Book for Girls"](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Book-Girls-Andrea-Buchanan/dp/0062208969/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361029678&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+daring+book+for+girls) by Andrea J. Buchanan and Miriam Peskowitz. I has a lot more content and includes such sections as: Fourteen Games of Tag, Queens of the Ancient World, Lemon-Powered Clock, How To Be a Spy, Make Your Own Paper, etc. It's the kind of book I'd like to hand down if I had a daughter of my own, as long as she doesn't mind the light-colored stain...

Anyway, they have a version for boys too, so maybe this will restore some faith in humanity for you. The boys book was quite successful and they realized there was a market for a similar book for girls. I thought it was fairly well done, and was pleased to see much of the content was actually similar. Though as I recall, the boys book was "The **Dangerous** Book for Boys" whilst the girls' book was merely "**Daring**."  I would have wanted both books when I was a child.  I don't know who Bart King is, but I already don't like him. Wait. Let me check his girl guide to see if there's anything in there that I can use to insult him. I'm thinking some slang or cur--SHOPPING! And hair. I'm so distracted!

You have a certain job as a parent to help your kids interpret what they encounter -- not to police content so they end up with the political opinions you have yourself.  You also have a certain responsibility to give them enough confidence that they can weather the disapproval of others -- not to re-engineer society so that they never face reasonable challenges to their ego or self-concept.

If your daughter happily likes hair, shopping, and boys.... are you going to help "fix" her by telling her she needs to change her mind to something more "progressive"?  If that was ok, would you want someone saying she shouldn't have any books that cater to her interests either -- that her "girly" interests are inferior?  There's a little of that in your message.  That's not at all pro-woman -- that's pro-"a certain concept of women".  *(And isn't that the whole reason gender roles were bad in the first place)*

So, how to react?  Buy your daughter both books, get her boxing lessons, get her ballet lessons, buy her a .22 rifle, buy her a pink EZ bake oven, give her the space to become who she wants.  Let her know there's roles, but so what?  Doing what she wants is ok, traditional or not.  "Live and let live" means exactly what it says -- it doesn't mean sniffing your nose at girls who are feminine, get married at 20, or don't want a degree or a career.

Quite frankly its depressing to see your comment so upvoted -- the author wrote a book you don't like.  You treat it like a personal insult.  If you don't like it, just don't get it.  Other people have the right to publish content you don't like, and frankly, you should politely shut about it unless it harms you directly.  Do you want gender-normative assholes crying about content that doesn't cater to them?  If you are so sensitive that we have to start removing books from the shelves to protect your feelings, you have a problem, not society.

I don't know what it is, people just see snark/sarcasm trashing out-groups and upvote it like sheep.  What happened to "thoughtful, meaningful" content as in the sidebar?  Aren't you a mod?  2X has a different focus but in some ways this place is as bad as the PUA forums where I used to pick fights with misogynists until I realized they ran off emotion and not logic.

Whatever, I'm done.  I posted here politely for a few months and honestly 2X has shot my view of women downwards (though some are certainly exceptional and admirable).  I don't even know why I bother.   I wish I could unplug humanity from the internet.  It is making us worse human beings.

I will unplug myself at least. ***EDIT:  LINK FOR THE TERMINALLY LAZY, YET QUICKLY OFFENDED***

I will unplug myself at least. What you're essentially saying: people should be free to choose how they want to live, and given the free choice between any position, rather than placed into prescribed gender roles. You were careful to point out that forcing your girl to be like a boy is not compatible with this ethos. But who's asking for that anyway? No one has a problem with girls shopping. We're just asking: do you have a problem with boys shopping? If a girl wants to get married at 20 and raise her kids while her husband works rather than have a career of her own, that's fine. But it should be also fine if a guy wants to get married at 20 and raise his kids while his wife works. It's not the roles that are problematic - it's the fact that they're being attached to a certain gender. ***EDIT:  LINK FOR THE TERMINALLY LAZY, YET QUICKLY OFFENDED***

I will unplug myself at least. What bothers me is that the book for girls enhances the idea of beauty being important AND the chapter "boys". C'mon! Do kids think about love and dating? WTF? I thought about love and dating as a child. It's the influence of media. You can only watch so many fairy tales that end in weddings and see other, similar things, before you start thinking about it.

For my 9th birthday, I received some money and bought myself a doll and a chemistry set. That's how I plan to raise my kids as well. Whatever interests them is okay by me. I have absolutely nothing against a child playing with dolls and chemustry sets: that's an awesome combination! 

I guess I just kind of freaked out on this children dating thing ( and the extremely narrow and stereotypical idea of what girls like as depicted by the author of the book). I might need to reevaluate my thoughts regarding this; at the moment the over sexualization of children go hand in hand with young girls thinking, and encouraged to that, thinking about beauty and boys. It just feels like... shouldn't they be playing and not imitating adult women in a, in my experience and opinion, unhealthy manner.

I will unplug myself at least. Since your post is a throwaway and you say you're unplugging, I don't know if you'll ever see this, but here goes:


First off, nobody's condemning stereotypically "girly" interests like hair or shopping.  There's nothing wrong with a girl who likes to shop or do her makeup and hair, and I think most folks on here will freely admit to that (and many like it themselves).


What bothers me about those books, and why I do think it elicits protest, if not an emotional response, is that such books pidgeonhole children, even if their parents don't. And such gender-role enforcing children's books and toys abound. I can remember as a little girl being so frustrated that the books I enjoyed were marketed to boys, were labeled for boys. Of course my mother told me I could be who I wanted, but to my little-kid brain it still felt wrong, like they should belong to someone else.


And that pattern for me has continued throughout my life. This for women, this for men. What's wrong with catering to both? With writing a book about insults and weapons and adventures and NOT labeling it for boys or girls? Representation is important because it makes children feel like they belong, and that's not always a feeling parents can teach them. The desire to conform is a powerful thing, and I don't want marketing, and media, to put the pressure to conform on kids. And I don't think that's too much to ask. Staying silent is in itself negative and destructive. Why shouldn't we wish for more inclusion? For a better world? It's not just these books, its the toy isles in every store, the clothing lines, the TV and movie characters. I see a pattern of hair and shopping directed always and only at girls. Why should I accept that? I won't.


As for snark, humor lightens every load, and I still see plenty of thoughtful, meaningful content on this subreddit. If you can't handle people upvoting jokes as well as discussions, then yeah, maybe you should move on. Actually, I'm totally condemning shopping as an interest. Shopping is not a hobby. Shopping is spending money to get things you need. Fashion? Great! Toys? No problem! But spending money is not a hobby. Actually, I'm totally condemning shopping as an interest. Shopping is not a hobby. Shopping is spending money to get things you need. Fashion? Great! Toys? No problem! But spending money is not a hobby. I think obviously one must shop sensibly, but there's nothing wrong with getting enjoyment out of going out and choosing the new stuff you need, and taking it home with you.

You have a certain job as a parent to help your kids interpret what they encounter -- not to police content so they end up with the political opinions you have yourself.  You also have a certain responsibility to give them enough confidence that they can weather the disapproval of others -- not to re-engineer society so that they never face reasonable challenges to their ego or self-concept.

If your daughter happily likes hair, shopping, and boys.... are you going to help "fix" her by telling her she needs to change her mind to something more "progressive"?  If that was ok, would you want someone saying she shouldn't have any books that cater to her interests either -- that her "girly" interests are inferior?  There's a little of that in your message.  That's not at all pro-woman -- that's pro-"a certain concept of women".  *(And isn't that the whole reason gender roles were bad in the first place)*

So, how to react?  Buy your daughter both books, get her boxing lessons, get her ballet lessons, buy her a .22 rifle, buy her a pink EZ bake oven, give her the space to become who she wants.  Let her know there's roles, but so what?  Doing what she wants is ok, traditional or not.  "Live and let live" means exactly what it says -- it doesn't mean sniffing your nose at girls who are feminine, get married at 20, or don't want a degree or a career.

Quite frankly its depressing to see your comment so upvoted -- the author wrote a book you don't like.  You treat it like a personal insult.  If you don't like it, just don't get it.  Other people have the right to publish content you don't like, and frankly, you should politely shut about it unless it harms you directly.  Do you want gender-normative assholes crying about content that doesn't cater to them?  If you are so sensitive that we have to start removing books from the shelves to protect your feelings, you have a problem, not society.

I will unplug myself at least.    So basically, all kids should get the boys' book. The girls' book is probably of more interest to me personally... there's actually not that thin a line between "stereotypical girl options shouldn't be the only option" and "stereotypical girl options suck and you're bad for liking them" but you've managed to cross it.

EDIT: Unless you were being sarcastic and making the same point to the OP that I was making to you, in which case apologies. You have a point, but remember the first chapter in the girls book is "boys". I think independence and self actualization is universally a good thing, so yes, I'd say the boys book is better reading material for a kid. It's hard to develop as a person when you're told the most important thing in your book is not you. The girls' book is probably of more interest to me personally... there's actually not that thin a line between "stereotypical girl options shouldn't be the only option" and "stereotypical girl options suck and you're bad for liking them" but you've managed to cross it.

EDIT: Unless you were being sarcastic and making the same point to the OP that I was making to you, in which case apologies. This is what I want to say, but didn't have the words for it. I like girly stuff and didn'tgrow up in an environment where I learned a whole lot about being a girl... About being a girl?

Damn it....that'll be stuck in my head all day.... Dance magic, dance magic dance! Damn it....that'll be stuck in my head all day....    I have an honest question. People are always up in arms about gender roles, but as parents isn't it your job to raise your child and explain to them that you can be a boy with feelings and girl who likes guns? That it isn't about gender it's about personality? So why do we blame society and books such as these for our problems and not just try to raise a new generation to not think that way? because kids aren't only raised by their parents. they are in school most of the day, they watch tv, they see ads, they see what's in stores. a parent trying to teach that gender roles are imaginary is fighting against an avalanche of outside influences. look at all the people in this thread saying "i wanted to play with bugs but i knew that it was wrong and not for me because the package was blue and there weren't any girls on the box, so i felt bad and wrong for wanting to play with bugs." i'm sure plenty of those people had parents who wanted them to feel unlimited in their choices, but when one grownup is telling you it's okay, while the entire rest of the world is demonstrating that it's not, you're going to have a hard time believing that one grownup. it's like growing up feeling ugly even though your mom says your freckles are beautiful.           As a guy, all the stuff in that boy  book sounds awesome and all the stuff in the girl book sounds boring. There's this big, prevalent attitude that stereotypically feminine stuff is worse or less cool than stereotypically masculine or neutral stuff. While it's TOTALLY FINE that you have a preference, please remember to not support that attitude. Anyone should be allowed to like any of these, so let's aim for that attitude. Thank. I am sick of all the women in this thread basically saying I suck because I think the girl book is fun too.  Thank.

Am confused :( Image Fest Friday, if I remember correctly. 

It's the one day of the week where everyone is allowed to post stand alone images to this sub.  Sorry to ask here, but wat does IFF mean? Am confused :(  He even received a few awards for his other book, *The Big Book of Boy Stuff*. I can't imagine it being much different than this.   This is so, so sad. Do kids at that age already think about makeup, boys and dating? Is it just me who thinks there is something sick in that?

Also explained why I as a 12 year old pretty much stopped reading childrens books and started reading adult literature (as in Nabokov and Steinbeck - not playboy!). I'm not exactly sure what age group those books are aimed at (I'm thinking tweens) but I when I was 11 I was thinking about makeup, boys and dating. I remember my friend and I would come to my house for lunch and I'd do our makeup so our parents wouldn't know. 

It all depends on the person, as with everything else.           I think we can safely say that Bart King doesn't know shit about girls.  If this gets me downvoted so be it, but Google can't seem to answer my question - What does 'IFF' stand for?  Aren't those books supposed to be satirical?          I'd really like to know, what does IFF stand for?    </snippet></document><document><title>Fellow ladies who shed a lot: does a vacuum exist that will actually get hair out of carpet? </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18n6pn/fellow_ladies_who_shed_a_lot_does_a_vacuum_exist/</url><snippet>I have long very thick hair, and I shed EVERYWHERE.

The trick is a floorbrush. Something you would use on wood or slate. Brush your carpet before hoovering, and it picks up all the hair, and things that would otherwise burn your hoover out. Then do the tidying (let dust caused by hoovering settle) then hoover (pick up dust).

A hoover is the english for vacuum by the way. I second this approach.  I use a floorbrush type attachment with a hand vacuum.  (Any rubberized brush attachment for pet an animal hair will do.  This works wonders before using a vacuum with a rotating brush.  

Inevitably, long hair will always clog a rotating brush vacuum.  Clockwork's approach gives you the best of both worlds. Jesus christ my nickname at school was esme weatherwax. Lol, why?

I'm sorry for the rant, but I really need to tell someone this. This may be a small trigger for sexual abuse? I'm not exactly sure, but better safe than sorry.
     For reference, I am only 14 years old. I have a sister who is 16.
     Please excuse my memories of exact dates, order of events and somewhat terrible paragraph order/formatting. Hopefully this isn't too hard to read/understand. Sorry for any spelling/grammatical errors.
     Also, I'm not exactly sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this. If mods would like me to move it, I will.


Alright, so, on Halloween night in 2010 (I think), my mother found something of my fathers in the basement, a small amount of child pornography. A big scene happened and I ended up having to call the cops on my father. He was arrested for about 2 weeks, and then he went to court.

While in court, he confessed to molesting my cousin, when she was only 8 years old, on several occasions. He was sentenced three years, and was sent to a correctional center in a small town not too far from my city. 

His parole officer, let's call her Linda, was a massive bitch. Maybe she was just bitter because something of the like happened to her as a child, but she did little to no work for my father.

After maybe 6 months, my father was granted parole. He wasn't allowed to drive, be at our house alone with me or my sister, and had a curfew of 11PM. He lived in a "halfway house" downtown with other former inmates on parole. He resumed work, which he walked to everyday since he was not allowed to drive.
After about a month of parole, he was confronted by the cops (because of Linda accusing him and for some reason wanting him to go back) about breaching his parole. They accused him of driving around town and staying at our house. He was sent back to the correctional center.
He now lives in houses around the prison, built for inmates. They are still technically in prison, they are just trusted.
He's been there for longer than a year.

Now, while my father was away, my auntie, my mum's sister, died of liver failure due to alcoholism. I've never seen my auntie sober except for when she was in the hospital, and she was in very bad shape then. 
She was common law with my uncle, we'll call him Jim. They had three kids together, who are now 24, 20 and 18. The 18 year old is the only one who still lives at home.

Maybe my mother was lonely. Maybe my sister and I weren't good enough for her. But she started dating Jim.

My mother's work went out of business, so she lost her job.

She did not talk to me or my sister about this. She did not ask us if it was okay. She moved Jim and my cousin into our house without our consent after not even a month of dating. She did not tell my father about this either.

I absolutely hate it.

I am completely and utterly uncomfortable in my own house.

My cousin is 18, all he does is sit on his ass and giggle like an eight year old girl with Angelman syndrome at YouTube videos. I hate him, he's so annoying. He's a know-it-all, and he never stops talking. Ever.
     My uncle disgusts me. It has been almost a year since my auntie has passed, and I understand it's okay for him to find another woman and fall in love and get back to normal, but the fact that he went for his dead wife's sister is disgusting. 

I feel like Jim is turning my mother into my auntie. Like I said, I've never seen my auntie sober. My mother is getting that way.
She has struggled with alcoholism for years, and she was finally getting better just after my dad left. Then she started dating him and she's been drunk basically ever since.

It hurts me. I hated seeing my auntie in the hospital, wasting away, barely conscious. Her skin was yellowing and she could barely talk. When she was awake she was crying. I can't help but think this will happen to my mother. I don't want to see her like that, no matter how much we fight.

Which brings up the fights. We never had any major problems until she started drinking again. Now she calls me a bitch on a daily basis. She tells me I have no real friends, that they all actually hate me because I'm a massive bitch.
She yells at me for staying in so much (Which I only do because I'm depressed, and have slight social anxiety.). I tell her those reasons, but she just interrupts me and yells at me that I was like this even before my dad left.

She always blames everything on him. 


I just don't know what to do anymore. I hate my house.
Being only 14, it's hard to find a good job, and even then it'd still be very, very hard to support myself. I know I want to move out as soon as possible, though. I need a way out of here as soon as possible. I hate it here.

The choices my parents have made have messed me up, probably even more than I'd like to confess. I'm just really tired of having to deal with this all by myself, and I want out.

Thanks for reading.
  Do you have any other relatives you could stay with? Are you close with your best friends parents? I guess basically what I am asking is if you have a safe place to crash for potentially the rest of high school. Even if your other relatives are in a different state, it might be worth looking into moving in with them.

I am so sorry you are going through this. You sound like a very strong, intelligent young woman and you are wonderfully brave for trying to get yourself out of this. Don't be afraid to talk to a counselor at school to find additional resources. Unfortunately my other relatives aren't too well off, and most are also alcoholics. My best friend's family situation isn't to swell either.
But, I am fairly certain that there are some family friends that would let me live with them, but don't live in my city and I'd hate to have them drive me into the city everyday for school, or have to move schools and lose the good relationships I have. But that may be a necessary sacrifice.
I plan on talking to my school counselor when I get the chance, she's usually really busy.

I need some advice.

My partner and I live on the second floor of a two story apartment. When they first moved in, they asked, and I agreed to give one of my downstairs neighbors a ride to a bus stop, seeing as they were new to the area and didn't speak English very well. I also babysat their ten year old daughter twice. I was unemployed at the time and had just moved into the area myself, so I was glad to make some new acquaintances and help out. 

However, in the past year, I've started working full time and made a lot of my own friends. And I have no idea how to communicate to my neighbors that I'm no longer available or willing to give them rides, babysit their kid, run them errands, or even really interact with them outside of a polite smile when we see each other. 

They've gotten into the habit of asking me and my boyfriend to help them out with a lot of things, whether it's putting together a piece of furniture or helping them carry something heavy, or picking their daughter up from school. It's not like I really mind doing these things for them, necessarily, but we both really value our privacy when we're at home. Our apartment is our sanctuary. We spend eight to ten hours a day interacting with different people, and when we come home, we don't want to have to answer the phone or the door. 

It's really frustrating because it feels like they're always invading my privacy to ask me for favors. They've also buzzed our buzzer late at night on three separate occasions to say that it smelled like something was on fire in our apartment. (Nothing was amiss, one time we were burning incense and the other two times it was just food cooking. I think they're a little paranoid.) 

It doesn't happen on a super frequent basis, but it's happened enough times that it just stresses me out when I hear them open up their front  door. Is there anyway we can communicate to them that we don't want to be bothered without sounding rude?  &amp;gt; Is there anyway we can communicate to them that we don't want to be bothered without sounding rude?

No. The polite way is to honestly answer each request. Even if you decline every time.   I'm reminded of one of my favorite Robert Heinlein quotes

&amp;gt;Do not confuse "duty" with what other people expect of you; they are utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe to yourself to fulfill obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to die. Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect.
But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible. It is easier to deal with a footpad than it is with the leech who wants "just a few minutes of your time, please &#8212; this won't take long." Time is your total capital, and the minutes of your life are painfully few. If you allow yourself to fall into the vice of agreeing to such requests, they quickly snowball to the point where these parasites will use up 100 percent of your time &#8212; and squawk for more!
So learn to say No &#8212; and to be rude about it when necessary.
Otherwise you will not have time to carry out your duty, or to do your own work, and certainly no time for love and happiness. The termites will nibble away your life and leave none of it for you.
(This rule does not mean that you must not do a favor for a friend, or even a stranger. But let the choice be yours. Don't do it because it is "expected" of you.)

When you want to help out, help!  When you don't want to, say "No".  Maybe this is rude and maybe they will like you less, but you have to choose whether your time is worth being rude or worth the esteem of your neighbors.   Ask them for favors.  Constantly.  If they vanish, you're done.  If they come through, scale back and realize you have some excellent friends. This might not work because they might not be in a position to actually do anything for the OP.  They may want to, but they may just not have the means.  For example, the OP gives them rides places because they don't have a car, so the OP can't ask them for anything car-worthy.  Also, asking for favors when the OP doesn't really need anything sounds a little spiteful.  This might not work because they might not be in a position to actually do anything for the OP.

If they come through, scale back and realize you have some excellent friends.   I think the fact is that American culture is different from a lot of foreign cultures.  Foreign countries have a much stronger sense of community and its just expected for people to help each other all the time.  This is good and bad - it's good because it means that people have a strong support network but it's bad because it means that lazy people get a free ride.  In a lot of countries, families have a perpetual open door policy (walk in whenever you want), no strong sense of individual property, and a weaker sense of personal space.  Americans, on the other hand, are a lot more individualistic (and are becoming more and more so).  If you listen to immigrants talk about Americans, they often accuse Americans of being cold and selfish.    Tell them that you can't give them rides any longer because your schedules have changed. Tell them you're not available to babysit on a moment's notice and that you might not be available, because you have increased demands on your time elsewhere.

If they buzz late at night, make sure one of the first things you say is, "It's kind of late, don't you think?"

When they ask you to carry heavy furniture say, no, sorry, you wrenched your wrist yesterday and it still hurts. And your boyfriend is getting over a back ache.

Politely keep declining. They'll get the point eventually. &amp;gt; "It's kind of late, don't you think?"

No.  This kind of passive-aggressive behavior won't work, because they apparently don't understand social norms.  They'll respond "no, I don't think it's too late."

The first thing you should say is "please don't buzz me after 9:00 pm again" &amp;gt; "It's kind of late, don't you think?"

Not really.   

I spent a big chunk of my life ignoring and avoiding my neighbors like they had the plague.   When I stopped doing that and got to know them and became part of a community it was a real life changer for me.  

 Not everyone wants that, though, and it sounds like OP is one that doesn't. Not to be rude, but yes, I have no interest in becoming friends with this family. In the year and a half or so that they've been living below us, they've caused more than a few annoyances. 

One of the main reasons I'd prefer to stop interacting with them is because communication with them is quite frustrating, since English is not their native language. They're also very loud and have a large extended family that comes and goes at all hours of the night. They're nice enough people, but they definitely are not people that my partner and I have anything in common with and don't really wish to adopt into our circle of friends. Is it more the regular requests for favours, the general noise &amp;amp; the way they live, or the communication that annoys you most? Have you talked to them about the noise &amp;amp; other problems? Might be a way to respond to the next request for help. I'm sorry I don't have time, and could you ask your visitors to keep it down when they come &amp;amp; go after midnight?

Since I'm currently on the recieving end of people who can't be arsed talking to me cos I don't speak their language perfectly, I feel compelled to point out that it isn't really a reflection on their characters or value as friends that they don't speak your language... It's not that I have a problem with English not being their native language. Like I said, they're nice people, but it's almost impossible to communicate with them. I would say English is their second language, but to be honest, their ten year old daughter speaks more English than both of her parents put together.           I really thought TwoX would be a place where people understood how important it is to say "No" clearly and strongly even when it's awkward and people are going to be grumpy about it. (Thank god it looks like the commenters on this thread, at least, do.) Please learn this important skill before you have children who are going to pick up your behavior. It's not really that I have an issue saying no; I have declined several of their requests in recent weeks. The issue is I want them to stop *asking.* I don't like having to put on pants at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon to answer the door to tell my neighbors that I'm not available to run an errand for them. 

And it's sort of irrelevant, but I'm not having kids, so thankfully I won't be passing this, or any of my bad habits, on to anyone. :)</snippet></document></searchresult>
