The one I remember that was the highest was 286, but did he mention a number higher than that? Also, do you think that Robin will ask how many people he's slept with on screen? It may seem weird, but I really want to know how many girls the Barnacle tapped before he got tied down.   The highest number actually mentioned was 283, in "The Perfect Cocktail" which was near the end of season 6. About 6 months earlier it was 237 (I think), which would mean 46 girls in 6 months, or roughly 7-8 per month. Since then he's dated Nora for a while, Quinn for a few months, and Robin since December. I estimate that given a constant hookup rate of 7 per month in between these times, Barney has slept with (wait for it) ~320 women.

Classic Schmosby  Isn't this because he wants Robin, so he doesn't want to be their marriage like the marriage he always had in mind? So that's why he's saying DJ. Because if he would marry Robin, he would hire a band.

Edit: Ok, my comment wasn't fully clear to everybody:
Ted always wants a band on his wedding. Not a DJ. But in the episode 'band or dj', Robin, the (almost) love of his life and Barney are getting married, and having a band was part of his idea of a perfect wedding. He doesn't want the love of his life having that part on her wedding, when he's not the one marrying her. So that's why he wants a DJ instead of a band.
I'm also sure that he'll have a band on his wedding. Isn't this because he wants Robin, so he doesn't want to be their marriage like the marriage he always had in mind? So that's why he's saying DJ. Because if he would marry Robin, he would hire a band.

I want to give your friend the highest of fives. High six? Never mind... High six? Never mind... According to Article 9:
"Should a Bro lose a body part due to an accident or illness, his fellow Bros will not make lame jokes such as &#8220;Gimme three!&#8221; or &#8220;Wow, quitting your job like that really took a lot of ball&#8221;.

I'm sure this is the same with extra parts too...

To be honest, I can't really think of a likeable girl Ted's dated on the show. Maybe it's because everything comes from his point of view, but apart from Robin, they certainly make it seem that it's always the other girl's fault for being crazy or needy or weird; it just takes a while for Ted to realize it. Ted can do no wrong in relationship terms...even with Victoria we eventually find out she's almost as guilty as he is (from his point of view at least). I liked the mother's roommate, Cindy or so. But that's actually a really good point you made, that most women Ted has dated seem to be unlikable because he tells the story and they are his exes. I liked season 1 Victoria  yeah...then they completely destroyed her character :/ No, Klaus did. Effing German.

Edit: Fuzzy Nomenclature

Edit 2: singular German She only fucked 1 German as far as we know. Given a normal dating cycle vs length of time in country, Imma haveta disagree. Except she started dating Klaus a day after breaking up with Ted (presumably whilst being faithful until then) then 6 years later she almost gets married to the same Klaus after moving back to NY. So unless she cheated on Ted or Klaus in germany (there is no suggestion she did sleep with anybody else) her total count is 1 German. No, Klaus did. Effing German.

But that's actually a really good point you made, that most women Ted has dated seem to be unlikable because he tells the story and they are his exes. We just had an episode about this where the gang confronts Ted and say, "You know Ted, maybe it's you." Basically Ted is Taylor Swift. It's probably why he thinks he can pull off the red cowboy boots.

edit: Also probably why he thought he could pull off dyeing his hair blonde But what would happen if Ted dated Taylor Swift? 0_o

      I have to respectfully disagree. Remember the movie which was based off Ted and Stellas relationship?
In said movie during an episode I forget the name of, it is clear Ted was in the wrong.
I also have to disagree about Robyn because she treated Ted the worst.
If you remember how Robyn acted in consideration to Ted you will realise how bad of a friend and worse of a partner she was.
Victoria was in no way crazy but the new girl is.
What about Mary the paralegal? She wasn't crazy either.
Look Ted is a a good guy but he makes mistakes as well.(No tomorrow?)
I despise Robyn and her daddy issues.
Granted, the time was given to flesh out her character so we understand but it if wasn't then she would be the worst of Ted's girlfriends.
She: Tells Ted she doesn't want a relationship but gets into one anyway.
Says she has no feelings but kisses him anyway then tells him to turn it off.
They break up and she goes to Argentina only to come back with a guy to parade around Ted's friends.(she sticks around because fuck ted right?)
She stays in his apartment post break up only to use him for sex KNOWING that Ted loves her.
She sleeps with Ted's apprentice because he has keys to TEDS bathroom.
She sits there and acts innocent to all of Ted's girlfriends but when it blows up she's all smiles and "still friends right?"
To top it off, EVERYTIME a relationship ends she cries to Ted and strings him along more. Every single time. 
I hate Robyn and how she has abused Ted.
Oh and she marries one of Ted's best friends. You do know that Robyn's only in one episode right? You do know that Robyn's only in one episode right? I don't know Robyn. I know Yobin, though. SPOILERS!!!! MUST BE CAUGHT UP TO READ.

Oh and she marries one of Ted's best friends. So, I'm not going to downvote your opinion, 'cause that's not what downvoting is for. However, to begin with, Stella knows what she did to Ted was horrible. That's made clear in the episode As Fast As She Can (S4E23). She also knew it was necessary. The movie Tony made was from a very slanted point of view, and pretty much warped every detail of the relationship, so I'm really not sure if I'm reading it correctly that you're using the movie as an accurate account of what happened.

On to Robin: You're looking at it from a very narrow point of view. As a guy who relates to Ted a lot, I tend to see all of the things he's doing wrong because I do the same things. If you're a romantic like Ted, then you'll have seen all of the cheesy movies where persistence pays off, and think that's how real life works, and well, it sort of does. Persistence in Ted's case paid off in getting Robin to like him, but he knew from the start that she didn't want the whole marriage and kids thing. They both just ignored it, and that was very evident in their break up ("Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"). When Ted kissed Robin (yes, Ted kissed her, not the other way), she told him beforehand that there was no off switch to his wanting to settle down, and he disagreed. When Robin comes back from Argentina with rebound guy, she tries to be nice about it with Ted, which ends up making Ted that much more jealous, but she did try. As far as sticking around, I think Lily had a lot more to do with that than Robin. She (Lily) even talks with Ted about how Robin is one of their friends now too, and she's going to be around after they break up. When two exes live together, the relapse sex is a risk you take. In that scenario, Ted broke it off because of Barney, not because of anything either of them felt at the time. I fail to see how the apprentice thing is relevant. Ted wasn't trying to date her at the time, and even if he was, just because a guy likes a girl that he has a history with doesn't mean that girl should just stop dating for him (I had to come to this realization on my own when I was younger and more annoying).

Finally, I know it's not a big deal, but since there has been a character that is not Robin that was specifically named Robyn, I would suggest getting used to spelling it with an 'i' to prevent any misunderstandings. This post is perfectly clear, but others might not be. SPOILERS!!!! MUST BE CAUGHT UP TO READ.

Robyn Sparkles is the worst. To be fair, all of the single characters have glass-shattering annoyances. But ummmm, I don't see how that relates to the discussion about Ted's girlfriends. They are (also) single? Did you not catch that reference? They are (also) single? To be honest, I can't really think of a likeable girl Ted's dated on the show. Maybe it's because everything comes from his point of view, but apart from Robin, they certainly make it seem that it's always the other girl's fault for being crazy or needy or weird; it just takes a while for Ted to realize it. Ted can do no wrong in relationship terms...even with Victoria we eventually find out she's almost as guilty as he is (from his point of view at least).  Sorry, but I can't hate Stella for this. Not when Ted provided the means for his own undoing.

From the start, Ted was insistent that they date, even as Stella continually rejected him. He knew she had baggage: a daughter; hasn't slept with anyone since her ex-boyfriend, father of their daughter, five years prior; unwilling to commit to a relationship with Ted. The signs are all there, yet Ted kept pushing to make it happen. He was rushing the relationship, and even admitted not knowing her *that* well. To top it off, he invited her ex to their rushed wedding (a wedding, btw, which was originally someone else's that they took over).

This is Ted being Ted, trying to take shortcuts and desperately wanting to find that feeling of being with *the one*. He forced this idea so hard, I can't help but feel sorry for all parties involved. But ultimately, the pursuit of the relationship, the evolution of the relationship, and the demise of the relationship were almost all entirely thanks to Ted's impulsiveness. (Which is why we like the guy, right? I mean, not as much as we used to, but that's for another post) Please, you're pinning all that on Ted? She had to agree to go out with him and she chose to marry him. You don't make that decision lightly, so it sounds like she jumped into something she wasn't ready for and Ted got hurt.

(Which is why we like the guy, right? I mean, not as much as we used to, but that's for another post) Everything you mentioned took 2 people to do.  Yes things we're rushed but she never told Ted she didn't want to do any of those things. Except the original date, but that was played off as her being "hard to get". 

It seems like your argument is that she was crazy and damaged so it was Ted's fault because he should have known she was?  Yes, Stella was at fault, but not solely at fault. Her biggest crime was accepting Ted's proposal (leaving him at the altar was bad, but getting married was an even worse idea...they were obviously meant to be with other people, so I applaud her "bravery" and remaining true to her feelings). Remember: *Ted's* proposal. She did not pursue the relationship, and was satisfied with just being friends from the very beginning.

There were many red flags, and no one forced Ted to do any of these things. I do not think she was crazy. She was a single mom who raised a nice daughter, and she had a successful dermatology practice which she commuted to several times a week. She seemed more well-adjusted than any main character outside of Marshall. Emotionally damaged? I won't go that far. Everyone understood that she had baggage though.  I agree she was damaged but not more so than anyone else on the show. Yes Ted is the one that pursued her. 

But I disagree that just because Ted was the one that initiated and pursued her, means that it going wrong was his fault. One person asks, the other accepts (or not). Once you've committed then it's "their" engagement not Ted's engagement. 

I agree that for her, she probably had no choice. If she loved Barry? Then she couldn't marry Ted. But that doesn't absolve her of the fact that she is leaving Ted at the altar and breaking his heart. What she's doing is still hurting him, she just has a good reason (to her).  At the time, it was somewhat foolish for them to be engaged. It was even more foolish to move up the wedding date. And it was damn foolish to invite Tony, her ex and father of her child, to the wedding. 

We don't really know what exactly went on through her mind at the time. If she was in love with her ex the whole time and she knew it, AND she decided to get married to Ted despite that, it's pretty awful to not tell him these things. I don't think she's evil or manipulative so I think she didn't realize what she truly wanted, until after seeing Tony. 

Try to put yourself her situation. You think you want to get married to this person. But this same person throws your ex (with whom you are not on speaking terms) back into your life, and now you realize that you would truly be happy with your ex. Do you get married anyway? It won't work. The lesser evil is preventing this huge mistake of a marriage from happening in the first place and breaking his heart now rather than later. I don't think she is a bad person for this. She's just...a person. I agree with everything you said. It was foolish for both of them to do what they did, but only in hindsight. In their situation, like you said, they didn't really know what they wanted. Heck she may not have even known she had feelings for her ex until faced with the situation of being at her wedding to marry someone else and having your ex there. 

She did the right thing (from our pov), but like you said, it was the lesser of two big evils. In the end though, it was her that decided to leave Ted at the altar on their wedding day. Even if she couldn't marry Ted, she could have spared his feelings by calling off the wedding, talking to him, and maybe take some time to figure herself out. 

But instead she runs away with her ex husband, leaving Ted wondering what's happened, with just a note trying to explain. Plus he had to face the guests alone, and basically clean up the mess. 

Of course all this makes good tv, so there's that, but you have to admit, the way she did what she had to do was pretty dickish.  I would have rather her leave Ted at the alter than he have a shitty first marriage. What I am saying and I think what Ted was saying, it turned out for the best.  I couldn't hate Stella easily because I like Elliot to much.     Hint: Black out her last name. Or white it out.  Or perhaps purple it out. The world is your oyster. Way to kill a joke. I thought it was amusing. Hint: Black out her last name. It's not her real name. It's a joke in my phone. I have a white friend named Nicole and a black friend named Nicole so this is how Nicole (the white one) but her name into my contacts It's not her real name. It's a joke in my phone. I have a white friend named Nicole and a black friend named Nicole so this is how Nicole (the white one) but her name into my contacts Very clever method   if your friends mad from that she/he's going to be pissed when she/he sees the episode the wedding bride That episode made me so annoyed. The writers asked me to suspend my disbelief just a bit too much. I just skip it now. It makes absolutely no sense. Stella's husband feels horrible for stealing her away from Ted, goes out of his way to make it better, Ted saves their relationship for them, and they make the The Wedding Bride?

Every part of it is stupid and awful. at first i thought so too, but then i realized that tony may very well have written a script in which everything happened the way it did for real, but the execs flanderized the character based on ted into even more of a jerk than he is for the sake of marketing. happens in hollywood all the time.

Also the fact that the entire show, while ostensibly being about how he met their mother, is actually more 'how Barney influenced me'. A couple of theories stemmed from the last episode and the one previous.

But apparently not for long.  This discrepancy with *The Final Page* I'm going to chalk up to Barney made Ted a copy of the Playbook, but forgot about it. Or, Barney does magic tricks and never burned it to begin with.  I'm a little disappointed that The Playbook still exists because to me it takes a little away from The Final Page. I thought it was a significant step for Barney to destroy it; one of the things that made me believe Barney was ready. Now I know it's all a lie... :\ Agreed. This is what pisses me off about the writers from time to time. We don't know that exact situation though. He could have destroyed his copy and this can be a copy he gave to Ted a long time ago. Yeah, but I am not feeling so hopeful right now. You're absolutely right though, it could be just a copy Ted has, but I am getting a little tired of the playbook joke. That's just me though. I agree they're dragging this a little bit too much, but I remember that, after the episode where Barney burned the playbook, people have noticed the copy they showed looked differently. Let's hope they've figured a good way to bring it back and it won't wipe out Barney's big decision.        I bet that Ted and that girl are going to break up at the end of this episode!!!! because we know that their relationship Literally Goes up in flames, and in that last picture she is holding (I think it's the playbook) with fireworks shoved inside.

I'm at the part where Robin is in the bathroom crying because of Ted, and Victoria, standing outside Robin's stall, hands her [spoiler] (/s "the bouquet of flowers under the stall. This tradition implies that the person whom the bouquet is handed to is next to be married.") Now, following that line of thought, and barring anyone outside of the group, this foreshadows [spoiler] (/s "Robin getting married with Barney. You might think that Lily and Marshall get married first, but they were already engaged") 

The writers didn't plan it, but it played out that way. At least that's what I think.   What a catch. Never ever would have even thought of that. Good job.  Robin's also the one who catches the bouquet at Marshall and Lily's wedding. Will The Mother catch the bouquet at Robin's wedding? I can see Robin with her canadian strength chucking it far enough it goes to the band You just blew my fucking mind. And really, that's the mind he uses most of the time. Now he's going to have to use the regular one. Think of all the fucking he might miss out on! Oh, the productivity! Robin's also the one who catches the bouquet at Marshall and Lily's wedding.  What if, through some zany series of plot twists and antics from the Gang, Ted catches the bouquet and it injures his hand? What if, through some zany series of plot twists and antics from the Gang, Ted catches the bouquet and it injures his hand? That would be nice. Every other theory I've seen so far is kind of sad and related to Ted still being in love with Robin, this one is far more optimistic and turned to his future. 

When do they usually do the bouquet stuff in American weddings, after the ceremony or after the reception (we've seen [spoiler] (/s "his hand is ok at one point during the reception"))?  They do the bouquet/garter toss during the reception.  At the ones I've been to it's pretty late in the reception, right before the bride and groom leave. Thanks, so the theory could tie up with what we've seen until now. It could.  Ted may tussle for the garter, and that's how he hurt his hand.  But that wouldn't exactly explain why he's at the train station alone.  Maybe he's so depressed that he *didn't* get the garter that he just decides to leave.  I don't think they say what time it is in that episode, but it's clear he left near the end of the reception due to the fact that the mother, who was playing in the band at the reception, shows up just moments later.  So I don't know that Ted left early or was asked to leave, like some people speculate (unless he was waiting for a train for hours, which doesn't seem likely, but I don't know much about train schedules).  Hmm... I guess we'll just have to wait.

edit:  I agree that the other theories about Ted being in love with Robin are rather sad.  I truly hope he's well over her by then.  I want the last few episodes before the wedding, if not earlier, to prove that.  It's possible he could punch someone, but  if that's true it  would have to be someone being and enormous jackass, otherwise the mother (if she sees) may not like him after that and he *would* be asked to leave by Barney/Robin.  Ted says he's only ever been in one fight.  Maybe throwing one punch doesn't count at a fight if the other person doesn't fight back?  Maybe he punches a wall in frustration that he's still alone.  I just hope it's not something related to being in love with Robin still, especially since he meets the mother later that day and is supposedly in love with her right away, Yeah, I'm not sure anymore if we have to think he left earlier because of some kind of accident. The flashforward confirms he didn't leave until some time during the reception, and his hand is ok at that point. That kind of kills the theory of Ted bursting into tears while making the toast at the begining of the reception, confessing his feelings, cutting his hand and being asked to leave. You are correct about the punching theory. It's possible one punch doesn't count as a fight. If he punches someone who is acting crazy for some reason, chances are he wouldn't be asked to leave. Brad was openly pursuing Scooter at Lily and Marshall's wedding, and was walking around half naked, yet he wasn't asked to leave. 

I am begining to think that whatever happens to his hand is not directly related to him leaving. Maybe it's just another random thing that goes wrong that day. Maybe Ted will do his best to perform all his duties, and, at the end of the day, he'll just be confronted to his emotions, and will realize he's in the same place as when the story began. He could have plans for the night, but, feeling sad and alone, he could decide to go home by train.

As for the bouquet, I don't know if he could be upset because he didn't get it. I live in Europe and most people I know seem to think it's a tradition for one of the girls to catch it. I am pretty sure a guy here wouldn't try to get it, and he wouldn't be upset if he didn't (though it would still be considered symbolic if it happened). Of course, it could be different elsewhere, and knowing all the jokes they made about Ted's emotions, that kind of scenario wouldn't be so strange.</snippet></document><document><title>Reminded me of Barney</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/mCYO1AT.jpg</url><snippet /></document><document><title>What the fake online dating profile Barney made to trick Ted said

 Did you know that 83% of barney's statistics have 83% in them    I like multi dimensional characters, and ones that have some kind of tension and inner struggles within them. Because of that, my favourite is Barney, and the second one should be Lily. Robin should be the third one, but I am kind of biased as, in my opinion, the writers don't seem to focus enough on the complexity of her character. Ted and Marshall come after that, not because I don't like them as characters (they've both great personalities), but because I relate less to their inner challanges.

That being said, I think that for a sitcom, all five of them are very deep and well written.   1 Swarls Barkley

Ted Mosby is the worst main character in sitcom history.   Except what he said to Lily! That wasn't nice  He's a rich bitch... he's had plenty of high-horse moments, but ultimately his good nature comes through... sort of. Well, to be fair in this instance he was only interested in making amends with Lily since she managed to pick a painting that increased a lot in value. I was really expecting him to apologize about what he said True, but at the same time, just moments after she left, he went and bought the painting based simply on the fact that she said she liked it... not TOO bad of a guy. That doesn't make him a nice guy at all! That means that he thought she was right, but still insulted her anyway. The definition of mean.  Except what he said to Lily! That wasn't nice  I don't think it came out as mean-mean, she was just a kindergarten teacher, but he followed her advice which means he trusted her enough to buy the painting. Yeah but even if he followed her advice, it was still a mean thing to say Read upthread. Since the whole episode was about misremembering the party, it could be that he didn't say it nearly as harshly as Lily remembered it. It could have been a passing comment which Lily interpreted to be much more mean-spirited. Considering that it never came up that Lily was a teacher, how would he even have known?  You could say that Zoe told him but that's an awful strange thing to remember and bring up at that time. Read upthread.

How's that? :) theory: what if he uses it on barney's wedding day.  Actually, there is a website leading to the next slap: theslapbetcountdown.com

According to it, the next slap is supposed to be around early May, 2013.   A lot of people use the Slap countdown, but I have a major problem with it. It doesn't land on a time around an airing of a show. It's around 4:30 pm est which doesn't make sense.  Right, but the characters have been doing things at 2 a.m. in the show when it's clearly not 2 a.m. when the show is being aired.  
  
The slap countdown applies to their world, not "the real world." If the episode recounts things that happened on May xx, 2013, the slap happens at 4:30 p.m. on May xx, 2013, and we don't get to witness it until the show airs later that night (8 p.m.) on May xx, 2013. Right, but the characters have been doing things at 2 a.m. in the show when it's clearly not 2 a.m. when the show is being aired.

Given Lily's eye for art in unlikely places, I was wondering if that would play any role in the future.  

Lily was also the one who advocated for a band at Robin's wedding. Given that the mother plays bass in the wedding band, and is a painter as well, I'm guessing Lily is going to approve of her and not sabotage Ted's relationship like she did in the past.   This post reminded me of why i dislike Lily so much. Who repeatedly sabotages their friend's relationships? Couple that with the fact that she thinks she 'settled' for Marshall, abandons her friends on occasion, lies about credit card debt to her fiance when she got  engaged, meddles in other people's lives, is unable to keep a secret, and steals shit from people who are mean to her, I can't stand the grinch.

I love that the writers created deeply flawed but likable, realistic, and relatable characters, but I don't think I'd be friends with Lily. I watch the show sometimes frustrated that fictional character Marshall didn't play the field more in the fictional HIMYM universe and meet a girl cooler than Lily. /endrant I've defended Lily many times before, but here we go again.

&amp;gt;Who repeatedly sabotages their friend's relationships?

Just Ted's - and it's generally for the right reasons. She didn't sabotage his relationships with Victoria and Stella, two women that she saw as a good fit for them (and yes, she bet against him, but she didn't actively make the attempt - Ted made a mistake many of us might make). With Robin, she didn't intend to, and she had a very cogent point in trying to make them talk things out about the future and how it could lead to a much more bitter breakup than their clean one back in season two.

She learned from the fight that she and Ted had and swore off doing it, which showed personal growth. She faces a moral dilemma when it comes to Barney and Robin - she doesn't want to until it becomes glaringly obvious to her that there is seemingly no better alternative, only brought 'out of retirement' at Marshall and Ted's urging seeing their downward spiral.

&amp;gt;Couple that with the fact that she thinks she 'settled' for Marshall

After Marshall badgers her into oblivion about it - and even then, her determining that she must be the 'settler' was shown to be false when she attacked Jenkins for kissing him, a pretty clear sign that their relationship dynamic isn't the one that Ted and Robin instilled in his mind. Logically you'd think she'd know otherwise, given the circumstances that led up to her and Marshall getting back together in the first place was because Lily was mad jealous about Chloe. It could just an ego thing that she'd put herself in that position given Marshall's obvious insecurity.

&amp;gt;abandons her friends on occasion

You mean when she left Marshall for San Francisco? It's harder to defend this, but for someone who had this idea about what they wanted to accomplish before settling down, that's a lot of gravity you can't just dismiss for very long. She freaked out. I can understand to a point. When she almost ditched Marshall for Spain, you have to admit that being that supportive really would push her to wit's end. It'd be better if she had just been honest in that regard, admittedly, but I think she thought she was between a rock and a hard place.

&amp;gt;lies about credit card debt to her fiance when she got engaged

It's not exactly uncommon to hide your problems from your significant other until you can't hide it any longer. When push came to shove, she wanted to take responsibility for her actions by trying to pay it down herself and trying to keep her name off of the mortgage. 

&amp;gt;meddles in other people's lives

With good intent. You can't honestly claim to not meddle in the affairs of your friends' lives - we do it everyday just by talking about what everyone else is talking about concerning your little group or whatever.

&amp;gt;is unable to keep a secret

All gossipy stuff, nothing that would actively harm another's life.

&amp;gt;and steals shit from people who are mean to her

Yeah, this is another one of those flaws that are hard to defend, so I'll concede to this. 

Meh. I'd still be friends with her. Then again I tend to be attracted to and care more for crazy girls.

I sincerely hope there'll be more growth for her to be less manipulative and such. Perhaps that's why they brought back the "Lily Justice" thing. I'm hoping that, as she grows up, she'll realize she CAN'T do all the things you just ranted about, and will simply allow her friends to make the choices she thinks aren't all that great, but will support them because she cares for them.

Marshal is an idiot with no inherent morality and Lilly is just a bad person. Marshall's a lawyer. Meaning he has a huge sense of morality and he's very intelligent. &amp;gt;a lawyer

&amp;gt;huge sense of morality 

&amp;amp;#3232;\_&amp;amp;#3232;...Maybe personally, yes, but I doubt Marshall was employing his sense of morality while working for GNB as long as he did. Probably hated hearing himself on occasion. 
    It good that she got the job, but it doesn't seem too realistic that she would get a job like that. I d'unno, if I was the one that bought a painting like that at her behest and made $4 million off of it I'd certainly be calling her back to see what else she might have in mind, which is probably what The Captain intends to do. It'd be cool if they show here and there how she does in that regard. </snippet></document><document><title>I feel like the Blitz</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/JMegGRs.png</url><snippet>   This is a thing?

People say it when they want others to not say/do something and they speak in pig latin.
Pig latin is where you take the first letter of a word and put it at the end, then at "ay"
'Mother' for example is 'othermay'
I have no idea what 'nicks' means, but it's quite common on American tv shows. Nix, actually.

They'll tell the story to the kids about how after they met, it wasn't all smooth sailing and there were some "things" that happened during the courtship.   That would be a nice twist. Esp. if they did it before they introduced the mother in the show. It doesn't seem like a bold prediction since the producers basically said something to the effect of, "If you're turning on the tv and HIMYM is on, there will be an obvious way to tell if the episode is or is not one from the final season." Wait...what?  I'm not "predicting" it. You are.  I'm just saying your idea would be a cool way to really toy around with the audience. Wait...what?  I wasn't saying you were predicting it.

One of the things I was hoping to learn from this thread:  Is it just assumed that we'll see the mother at the end of this season?  Or is it assumed that Ted will meet the mother?  Or do we know for sure either? Oops. Sorry. 

There are many schools of thoughts on that matter. I think with the announcement of the new season, they are probably going to reveal the mother in the next season.  How, or when, is really up to the writers.  I don't want to be a debbie downer but I have read somewhere that they could do season 9 in flash backs Like "kids I missed some things in 2006 or 2008 so let me tell you about that first" they could do this without showing the mother.TBH I would hate it if  they done this possibly wouldn't even watch it .so my fingers are crossed I hope your theory comes true.

Well, he did that already. He broke up with Karen for Lily and Marshall and broke up with Zoey for Barney (and his career); beside that, he didn't go any further with Robin when he had chances to do that because he want Barney and Robin happy together.

Definitely Marshall finding out about his dad. "I'm not ready for this".   That scene when Barney finds out Robin chose Kevin over himself. That single scene has made me slightly anti-Robin.  The ending of Tick, Tick, Tick when Barney is cleaning up the rose petals he had prepared on Robin's bed. The ending of Tick, Tick, Tick when Barney is cleaning up the rose petals he had prepared on Robin's bed.  Barney:  "You're just some lame suburban                          dad."

Barney's Dad:  "And why does that make you so mad?"

Barney:  "Because if you were going to be some lame suburban dad, then why couldn't you have been that for me?"

These quotes really showed a whole different side of Barney.  In this episode, he is seen as more of a respectable character, who finally let's out his feelings."  

Another scene I liked was when Robin and Lily are on the roof, and she says she's not ready to be a mom, and sometimes she thinks of running away and never looking back.  There are several other scenes throughout the series that are really memorable.   One great thing about How I Met Your Mother is because it literally has everything you could want in a TV show.  It has comedy, romance, adventure, a hell of a mystery, dynamic characters who are both dependent of one another as well as independent.  A really good plot/story line, and of course, the occasional scene that really speaks to you.  

 *Ted and Lily are on the roof Sounds like the beginning to a bad joke. Barney:  "You're just some lame suburban                          dad."

Barney's Dad:  "And why does that make you so mad?"

Barney:  "Because if you were going to be some lame suburban dad, then why couldn't you have been that for me?"

These quotes really showed a whole different side of Barney.  In this episode, he is seen as more of a respectable character, who finally let's out his feelings."  

Another scene I liked was when Robin and Lily are on the roof, and she says she's not ready to be a mom, and sometimes she thinks of running away and never looking back.  There are several other scenes throughout the series that are really memorable.   One great thing about How I Met Your Mother is because it literally has everything you could want in a TV show.  It has comedy, romance, adventure, a hell of a mystery, dynamic characters who are both dependent of one another as well as independent.  A really good plot/story line, and of course, the occasional scene that really speaks to you.  

  Marshall and Lilly breaking up, more specifically Ted finding Marshall on the steps, good God could I just ball my eyes out at that scene for weeks!  Bawl* Ahh thank you, I'd never actually seen that word in writing, only ever heard it. No homework.. for awhile Marshall and Lilly breaking up, more specifically Ted finding Marshall on the steps, good God could I just ball my eyes out at that scene for weeks!   Robin saying that she can't have kids   "My dads dead?"  The episode where Robin finds out she's infertile.  The whole sequence in No Pressure when they played "Shake it Out" by Florence.

Also, Last Words, when they're all in the back listening to the pocket dial. Some of the best acting I've been on the show.      I swear I got something in my eye as soon as I started reading this thread I got something in both eyes  Barney: Because if you were going to be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!

Can relate.  Easily Jurassic Bark.... Oh wait, wrong TV show... I'm gonna have to go with Marshall's dad dying.   Stella and Ted, i really liked them together:/ but hey it needed to happen for him to meet the mother. I just hope i like her:/              When Robin finds out she can't have kids. I know she didn't necessarily want kids, but any woman hearing that would feel like they got punched in the gut, I think. I think the saddest part about that episode is that it was really feel goody and you thought you were getting barney/robin story line and then boom crash it wasn't even real.      When Robin Sparkles becomes Robin Daggers...  SERIOUSLY?! How many times are we going to have this conversation, folks? This shit is getting real old real fast...  The opening scene of this crappy show. I was so sad when it started.  sure makes sense to go to the subreddit then.. It was in r/new. </snippet></document><document><title>'Some questions weren't meant to be answered'</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/18wtb5/some_questions_werent_meant_to_be_answered/</url><snippet>I don't think we're going to find out Barney's job, last week he said, "Some questions are just not meant to be answered [...] like where do I work?", does this mean that we'll never find out?  I doubt they ever will tell. For the simple reason, that no answer they give will live up to the interesting mystery they've created.

Personally, I'm pretty sure he's a transponster.   </snippet></document></searchresult>
