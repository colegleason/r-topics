This popped up on my frontpage feed. Yes. It's extremely obvious that it's red boots in the thumbnail, and spoiled the episode for me too.  Here too :( Doesn't it bring up more questions though? Like how? And im pretty sure the end of the red boots dont give away everything in the episode Doesn't matter it's still a major part of the whole story and I'd rather not have that be spoiled. Yes.

 Also, they were bros, not his parents. It really bugs me when people do that. They acted in a parental capacity for the formative years of Simba's life.

 Because Nathan Lane.  Let's put this entire discussion aside and forget about all the ridiculous assumptions that come from it.

WTF does this have to do with HIMYM? There is an episode where Ted and Barney consider raising a baby together as bros.  There is an episode where Ted and Barney consider raising a baby together as bros.  What season and episode? Halfway through season 2. Season 7 episode 15 or something. It's a long way to go for you.  I'm pretty sure Timon had a female love interest in Lion King 1/2, didn't he? No, the female meerkat in that movie was his mother. ...so? Timon may be many things but I don't think he's into incest. I'm pretty sure Timon had a female love interest in Lion King 1/2, didn't he?     Actually, it was his father in the skies who said to him ''Get your shit together you are a king''. With Pumba and Timon, he was a lazy ass who got beat by a lioness Yeah, it continually pisses me off that people use Timon and Puumba as examples of successful "two dads". It's the worst example. Simba fulfills his destiny as king IN SPITE of them.  Timon and pumba are not gay.

"I understand that. I understand that. I understand that. I understand that. Ok, copy that. How about I give you a different organ... My penis." You're saying it wrong. "My penis. My penis. My. Penis. MY PENIS! PENIS, PENIS PENIS." The may be my favorite episode ever. 

"I understand that. I understand that. I understand that. I understand that. Ok, copy that. How about I give you a different organ... My penis." I would like to know where the penis line was gonna work into the kilt outfit The play was called "My pet lockness monster". You can kind of guess from there.  Nessie is actually a very delicate and gentle creature.

.... "Weekend at Barney's Two!"  Bravo Oscar Oscar Bravo Sierra   "Because he ran out of Monet."

Classic Marshall You'll get that on the walk home.  "I'm gonna win her back" - I've been waiting for this call-back since Three Days of Snow (4x13).  One of the 'five words every man will say once in his life'.

I think this is the final piece of that bit? "I'm gonna win her back" - I've been waiting for this call-back since Three Days of Snow (4x13).  One of the 'five words every man will say once in his life'.

I think this is the final piece of that bit?  What girl hears "lying is my thing! I got you to marry me because of lies!" and is like "okay let's kiss"??? What girl hears "lying is my thing! I got you to marry me because of lies!" and is like "okay let's kiss"???  *sniff sniff*.. Did you just unhook my bra..?  Oh Lily's so many nip slips   R.I.P red cowboy boots   Don't worry, it's just some lady throwing explosives out of an apartment building in New York City.  If anyone could get away with it, it would be a cop. IS SHE A *CAWP*??? I DIDN'T KNOWNSHE WAS A CAWP!!!  "And that was the last bag of Skittles your Uncle Marshall ever bought..." can't wait to hear the story behind that!  How are there so many different hot girls at Mclaren's?!?!?

"No Robin, that is a couch...... oh you mean the play book on the couch?"   HA. Neruda. You would, Ted.  Bodacious! Was that shot-for-shot from part of that movie? I feel like it may have been. Also, Barney is totally Bernie's doppelganger.   Ending with CCR playing in the background, smart choice! I'll miss the playbook though and Ted's red boots. How will we ever know if he can pull them off now!  He pulled them off. The gay art collecting couple said so, so it must be true. I believe what you mean to say is "GCWOC."  I've never regretted never seeing Weekend at Bernie's more than I do now

EDIT: I just always have Barney on my mind   Why doesn't Ted just call the fucking cops. This is ridiculous. That is thousands and thousands of dollars of damage. SHE'S A CAWP She's A CAWP!
TED YOU NEVER SAID SHE WAS A CAWP! Why doesn't Ted just call the fucking cops. This is ridiculous. That is thousands and thousands of dollars of damage. Why doesn't Ted just call the fucking cops.

Frustration.    DAMN IT BARNEY! He's becoming the new Patrice   And then, maybe later, I could give you a different package.... my penis   This episode feels like the beginning of the end.    I hope Barney gives the playbook to Ted. I don't want it ever destroyed haha.    What's the name of the actor who played the one artist Lily was trying to talk to? He seems so familiar but I can't put a name to him. Christopher Nicholas Smith. He was in Paranormal Activity 3, a Honda commercial (I think), and is part of a Youtube sketch comedy group called Harvard Sailing Team. He's hilarious    [Flair challenge in progress](http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/ynteq/challenge_accepted/).

    Marshall was a high school junior in '96. Which just shows the writers don't give a damn about their own mythology because his freshmen year of college has been repeatedly stated as 1996. Which just shows the writers don't give a damn about their own mythology because his freshmen year of college has been repeatedly stated as 1996.    Anyone else getting slightly concerned by the dysfunction in Barney and Robin's relationship? I love them both but the "you agreed to married me because I lied" and Barney having panic attacks about monogamy are seeming pretty unhealthy.

Build up to the wedding day drama?  Besides the Skittles part, I really didn't like this episode at all.  The Playbook returning was a pretty lame twist.  I really did think Barney got rid of it for Robin.  I'm so glad the Jeanette storyline is over because it felt fucking creepy as all hell, and went on way too long.  Beach, booze, and bodacious babes. Beer, bud, and bitches is the skankier version. 'Sandwiches' doesn't start with 'B' BLT's do.          Okay guys, which one is worse, Jeanette or Stella? I'm leaning towards Jeanette as Stella and Ted saw some closure I would hope so. The bitch burned his boots. THE BOOTS. Okay guys, which one is worse, Jeanette or Stella?

Creedence Clearwater Revival - "Long as I can see the light" Anyone know the song at the end?  I feel like this whole season has been spec written by people who only have a vague understanding of the characters. Some of the individual jokes are still funny, but they will sell out these characters for a quick laugh any chance they get.      This episode was horrible. They completely botched the Robin-Barney storyline here. We were supposed to believe that Barney's a changed man, but he still lies? And Robin is somehow okay with it because of one lame speech from Barney that their relationship was built on lies? really? Do you really expect me to believe that any woman would stay with Barney this way? With Barney and Robin's engagement there was a chance at showing an aspect of life after your  golden twenties deeply and meaningfully, like the decision to marry, have a child, "settle down." What we got instead is the lack of genuineness of their romance. They could've shown how serious Barney was, and could've shown the challenges in him changing his ways with less outlandishness and with more seriousness. Instead, the writers just put the big red nose on the character, and refused commit to the character's new self and opted for cheap laughs over genuine moments. This episode showed what is wrong with the show this season. The characters have become so outlandish and predictable.  What bothers me is that the show use to be so much better at showing Barney's depth. As early as season 1's "Game Night" and as recently as last season's "Tick Tick Tick" Barney gets to show emotional depth without being sold out for a cheap laugh. You nailed this season's problems when you say they have been to focused on his zany hijinks and pretending this doesn't undo a lot of the development the character has had over 7 seasons and they pretend to show he's having this year.        Did I miss something, or did the playbook teleport to Ted's place? Robin found the playbook on Barney's couch, got mad and left, then it goes to Marshall and Lilly at the art show, then all of a sudden Jeanette finds the playbook on Ted's couch... what? Robin walked into Ted's place and saw it on the couch. They weren't at Barney's.     </snippet></document><document><title>They Broke Up!

But he  promises next year will look and feel much different from past seasons: "It's going to be a new way to tell the story," he says. "You're never going to mistake a Season 9 episode from one of the previous eight."

I was thinking that maybe this could mean that not only would they cast the mother, but also cast a voice only actress who would narrate the show with Bob Saget. They could have different viewpoints on stories etc.,  or remember them differently, like in the Ashtray episode. I think it would be a cool new way to tell some of the stories. Thoughts?     </snippet></document><document><title>2013 SACE Research Project- Collecting Online Data - HIMYM</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/197pht/2013_sace_research_project_collecting_online_data/</url><snippet>Hi, I'm Ashlee from Adelaide, South Australia, an average 16 year old girl currently trying to obtain her SACE (South Australian Certificate of Education.) As part of our course, we are required to undertake the 'Research Project', a year long subject on a topic of our choosing. Being a long time fan of the show, I decided to focus my project on How I Met Your Mother. 

I have been a big fan of the show since I first started watching, and have found a welcoming community here, almost a second home in the HIMYM subreddit. For my research project, one of the largest components instructs us to get out into the community, albeit physically, or online, and conduct research of our own. I have spent the last few weeks working on a short survey designed to gather as much information possible on how some of the wider community views the show. 

I would be deeply privileged if anyone could take the time to fill in the survey I linked below, as it would give me some much needed hard evidence for my investigation. 

http://obsurvey.com/S2.aspx?id=40bbafa6-4c10-4f4e-842c-5b53c0b263cf

If you have any questions about the project, and or want to get in touch, just send me a pm.

Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate your help. 
Sincerely, Ashlee      </snippet></document><document><title>As those flaming red cowboy boots landed unceremoniously in front of Ted...</title><url>http://i806.photobucket.com/albums/yy346/underthelamppost/gifs/myemotions_troy.gif</url><snippet /></document><document><title>2 questions re this HIMYM image - what episode is this potted plant on the table from?</title><url>http://www.cbs.com/shows/how_i_met_your_mother/photos/1000100/sneak-peek-photos/35333/</url><snippet>  Also is Ted wearing the red cowboy boots?

Just started watching all the seaons against for the fifth time. Can't go to sleep without watching 2-3 episodes... 

Anyone out there feel the same??  I didn't start HIMYM until last year. I watched a season a day. I would wake up, watch an episode or two, go to class, come back and finish the season. I watched 7.5 seasons in 1 week.

I consider it a productive week. I did this with the show 24. That was a dark, dark time...   I wouldn't go that far, but the show makes me long for a close group of friends like that.     Same, i always watch some episodes in bed on Netflix on the phone, sometimes i do it even between classes.      I discovered the series roughly a year ago, have watched it through three times since. It's pretty much the only comedy of its kind that I enjoy, I've tried other sitcoms but none are as addictive and unique as HIMYM. I'm taking a break now but I guess I'll watch it again this summer, if not sooner.. Oh boy.         </snippet></document><document><title>I remember this one, now when I watch it all I see is Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead).

XD You let your entire household see what you do on reddit?         You must not realize actors are capable of playing more than one role in their carriers... Yeah... like... one guy on a carrier could be the communications officer AND a helmsman. For instance. Unless it's a big carrier, then those are probably two different people.

The show says it works 2 outta 3 times. IS THAT ACCURATE?! Have any of you ever tried it?  I can confirm that the 2 out of 3 is correct, as when my ex-girlfriend and her parents walked in, 2 out of 3 were impressed.    I'm not sure but I have a date coming up this Saturday and I have the urge to try it.     </snippet></document><document><title>Re-watching "Subway Wars", something is confusing.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/195hbc/rewatching_subway_wars_something_is_confusing/</url><snippet>So I am re-watching the episode "Subway Wars",(My favorite episode) and I noticed something, I might be wrong, but when the episode starts the gang is arguing about who can make it to Gregor's stake house the fastest, either by train, bus, running, or anyway barney can (faking a heart-attack lol). Well they all make it to the steak house at the same time and decide whoever makes it to the bar first wins. They run back and robin wins, But this is the thing, when she gets there Marshalls friend is waiting outside. This is where the problem is, was he or was he not at the steak house? and second the episode ends with robin and him eating at the steak house. So did they go back to the steak house or what happened? How did they run to Gregor's and back to McLaren's and end at the steak house. Sorry if this post is long it has been bugging me.  &amp;gt;Well they all make it to the steak house at the same time and decide whoever makes it to the bar first wins.

Nope. They all happen to meet up at the same place by accident, but it wasn't the steakhouse. They then raced the rest of the way to the steakhouse. Marshall and Lily bailed, Barney tripped Ted so Robin would win, and they ended up at the steakhouse.  I just got done watching this episode about an hour ago and stumbled across this post, and I happened to have the same question! When they get to that meeting point, they definitely say "whoever gets back to the bar first wins" but then they still run to Gregor's. It confused me, too, I think it was an editing error.

And as long as we're on this topic, obligatory reference to Robin's sister who also seems to have disappeared. On a similar, but unrelated note:

Robin is from Vancouver, which is known for being cosmopolitan and liberal and gay-friendly. However her aunt, who is a lesbian, lives on a farm in upstate New York. 

Of course, there a million explanations possible (aunt through marriage, reasons to move to NY, Robin went to NY so why not someone else, etc) but it was really convenient that she had a nearby relative that she could send her dogs to. I personally think the writers just got sick of "dealing" with the dogs.. I'm hoping she at least shows up for Ted and the Mother's wedding.  And as long as we're on this topic, obligatory reference to Robin's sister who also seems to have disappeared.  Apparently she was not well received by the fan base so they just never mentioned her again. How could she be poorly received?  She was only in one episode.  There have been far less likable characters that lasted a lot longer. Like Kevin, Nick, and especially Punchy. Ugh. Kevin was the worst.  Ugh. Kevin was the worst.  How could she be poorly received?

What do you think would have happened in the series?  Lilly would've been dropped from the group. The guys would be awkward and everyone would try to stay friends but it just wouldn't work. She would have her own boring stories with her teacher friends. 

Lilly would've taken Robin too, not consciously, but Robin would've drifted off with her. 

Robin and Ted never would've had a back and forth relationship and Ted wouldn't have idolized her as much, and neither would Robin and Barney. 

Because Barney doesn't see the True Love that is Marshall and Lilly, his desire for a monogamous relationship is postponed by 10 years at least. He eventually finds someone, a divorcee with kids who Barney step-dads well. He is ecstatic when they have kids of their own and Barney becomes Pop-pop. 

Ted continues on his journey for "the one" and eventually finds her. This might even happen sooner since Lilly isn't around to break up Ted and his girlfriends. 

Marshall eventually falls in love again, and again, and marries. He relishes his wife and the life they've made together, is happy to be picked over lifelong ambition. The wife is also a lawyer, they have a lot in common. But things happen and they end up divorced within five years. No children were had.  Niiiice. I didn't mean to kill the discussion, as I think it is an interesting scenario. 

I think Lilly would be the worst off- she looses a husband, the majority of her friends, and still doesn't have the art career she dreamed of. 

I think Marshall would be really bad off for awhile because he's heartbroken and distrustful of loving, plus he never had the single 20's to figure out how to date and meet women and how to act after one night stands. 

Robin's life would be significantly more boring as she loses shenanigans like crashing the prom with Lilly to check out a band for the wedding, and doesn't have bro-time with Barney at lazer tag.

Barney and Ted are the most unaffected in one way, yet not having Robin around will allow each to move on to other relationships, and so the M and L breakup also has  huge ramifications for these two. 

Who knew the show rests on M and L's shoulders? Ha! /talking to myself. Wasn't the prom crashing before Lily decided to leave for SF? And Robin and Ted didn't know about Marshall and Lily's breakup until after they'd gotten together, so maybe they would have stayed together for even longer than they did? (After all, wasn't Lily the one who instigated their breakup?)  It wouldn't have gone past two seasons.  The thought of this makes me really sad. I may be too emotionally involved in this show... **GOOOLDFISSH IN A WHEEELCHAIR!**
