I might be dead, I need to listen to South East Radio to see if I am dead.

Hen parties are crazy, the bride to be was dressed in tin foil at one stage, and not good when your daughter walks in on the conversation about how many vibrators we have!!! She left then. I'd like to meet the daughter. She sounds like a responsible person. From my bartending time Hen and Stag parties were generally the worst That was on the pre-hen party the main event is next weekend and we are going to Carlow for the weekend.

The daughter is sensible, I do not know where I got her from, I think maybe I brought home the wrong baby from the hospital. TIL that there are pre-hen parties. Holy God! That's feckin' mad altogether! Holy god is right, I fell home at 5 this morning. Thank fuck the bf is a taxi driver. 

Pre-hens are mad, our mammies and one of our grannies where dressing up in a suckey in knickers. &amp;gt; our grannies where dressing up in a suckey in knickers.

I really really don't want to know what that means.

Please please for the love that all is holy, don't enlighten me. Thanks.  One of my friends was out in Wexford last night. Not sure if Wexford town or Enniscorthy. The last time he text me last night he said he had just fallen in love. I apologise if it was one of your group that stole his heart.   Wrong sub-Reddit lad....this one here is for Irish problems not successes!! Can I complain about my selection of burises?  why of course you can, so long as you didn't have to much fun getting them!  You fornicated with Greg.  Due to drink, now me and Greg and going to be parents, as he is against contraception. Niamhish shall be Godmother. Should I ask you or Carrots to be godfather? It might be the ideal time for then to get together, what do you think? I think carrots would be an ideal choice.

After all, he is a reverend . You and Niamhish godparents and Carrots can baptise the child. I'm now charging &#8364;250 per gig and there's a bottle of Smirnoff and a box of Tayto on my rider. I am sure Greg will pay. I will supply the vodka and Tayto, I have vodka in the babies bottle, start them early. Have you decided on a name for the new arrival? I believe Mahommed is quite popular these days.</snippet></document><document><title>On Winning Streak nobody actually streaks. </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/193iez/on_winning_streak_nobody_actually_streaks/</url><snippet>It is bad enough that they get money, cars and holidays but they get to keep their dignity as well.

I realise that you can only estimate the speeds with which you provide your broadband services, but when I can see the exchange from my bedroom window those excuses ring extremely hollow.  Perhaps you are using a different measuring system and the 8 MB you are talking about are not the expected standard?  Either way, I think it would be best for both of us if you were realistic in your estimation.  It also irks me to have a bill every two months charging me for 8 MB services that don't exist.

Also, I understand that you think it fantastical that anyone would ever try to use anywhere near their allotted amount of internet but when I do, I would appreciate you not spamming RESET packets to my router.  My router is old and gets confused easily, this necessitates lots of resets and I really don't think that it is fair to do that to old equipment that is only trying to do it's best.

On the subject of spamming, I would also appreciate you not trying to remotely log into my router.  Even when I used your POS equipment, I turned remote administration off.  My firewall treats your repeatedly failed attempts to log in to a piece of hardware that doesn't exist as an attack and closes some really important and useful ports.


Lastly, please stop traffic shaping.  It's really obvious and unnecessary.  ADSL is by design, not subject to contention until it hits your DSLAM's at the little green box.  If you are unable to provide a service even though you rolled out fibre to almost every junction, stop pretending you have Next Generation anything.  

I can't quit you (literately) so please help,

yours in everlasting hope,

mdnrnr   I work for a company that sells eircom's stuff, so for the millionth time today, I am sorry they are so hilariously, completely incompetent. My friend, that is not your fault.  I'm glad you are gainfully employed.  And if you work in a public facing support position then double hugs for you.

I actually know lots of people that work for Eircom, trying to identify why they can't provide a really basic service that lots of other companies provide is mysterious and exciting.  Don't fuck up the mystery for the rest of us.  I pay them money each month just to see how incompetent they can be within 30 days,  if you explain it then I'm just stuck giving them money.  Quit ruining it for the rest of us. Oh I wouldn't presume to. What knowledge I've gleaned from the periphery of the beast over the years is quite enough to let me know that I don't want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes, but I do know it's an amazing entity to behold.  I am on one of their 3MB max lines, they tried and succeeded to get my Mother to upgrade to 8MB internet to avail of quicker speeds.

I despair that UPC will never roll out their fibre network to where I live.  I feel your pain, but can you help me out and tell me how to disable the remote administration? </snippet></document><document><title>I want a zebra now.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/190swv/i_want_a_zebra_now/</url><snippet>Should I paint the horses in the field black with white stripes or white with black stripes?

Edit: [Here's a picture of me with the newlyweds](http://i.imgur.com/qNRBbM8.jpg). The ceremony took place in the ruins of the Adare Manor Abbey. I was really nervous doing the ceremony and I fluffed a line when I was reading from the prepared script.

The ceremony was wonderful and to me as an old jaded cynic it gladdened my heart to marry a couple so obviously and madly in love after being in a nine year relationship. I had a great time with the couple and their friends down in Adare Manor and was honoured and humbled that they trusted me to officiate at their wedding here in Ireland.

Another thing re the Italian MD: when I went to the gents, on my way back into the dining room the MD said to me: "Welcome back father". Another thing that weirded me out a bit: a bottle of wine was ordered for the table: The MD poured a taste for one of the ladies and when she said "Ok it's good" he poured wine for all the three ladies at the table and then came around the table and poured wine for me before pouring wine for the other men at the table.



  You should have planted a forest on their grounds overnight to teach them to have some respect, reverend. I did steal some acorns. I am shocked that the Metro newspaper has not identified you as a religiously motivated domestic terrorist yet.  I eagerly await the next edition of the Evening Herald, which is totally not the same newspaper at all and is in fact the last bastion of right thinking people who happen to travel on public transport.  The Sun have offered me &#163;52.23 to appear on page 3 in my ~~ex-girfriend's~~ knickers and express my opinions in a monosyllabic 14 word speech bubble.

The temptation is killing me......  Could it be that he's a Baby Carrot?  Don't be trying to butter him up. I am not dangling anything  So what's your schtick? A carrot stick can be a tasty alternative to celery. As the nun said to the priest at the wedding in Adare "Carrots are nice but I couldn't eat a whole one". There were no nuns at the wedding. I' m going to post a photo when I get home from the pub as I'm celebrating my 21st birthday tonight  (again)  I am confused. Are you the priest or the guy with the rose in his hand? I'm the Reverend (my legitimate title), the little guy in black with the short hair on the left beside the wonderful newleyweds. Oh right. My vision of you was very tall and skinny with longish hair. One of my good friends is a reverend in the arse end of Kerry.  Your vision of me is obviously wrong! I'm 'trim' with recently cut long hair and as evidenced by the photo I'm not terribly tall, but shure I don't give a shite about it. I had a fantastically great time with the couple and their friends from all over who came to the wedding.

^^They ^^bought ^^me ^^a ^^year ^^of ^^reddit ^^gold! ^^^Woohoo! Oh go you with your reddit gold. Will we now have to pay to talk to you? I thought you were a Pete Dotherty type. But his cousin is staying in my house tonight.  Now that I've performed my first wedding ceremony which I have now scratched off my bucketlist I'll have to consult with my new agent, new manager and new accountant about charging for my next wedding ceremonies.

And shtop it you, ya begrudging fecker 'cos they bought me reddit gold ***for 12 months***..... You know, this doesn't really count for "marry someone" on your bucketlist. Feck off you!! Semantically "marry someone" has two different meanings. It's explained in the "Now You Are A Reverend With the U.L.C." booklet. I married two wonderful people on St. Valentine's Day, though I doubt very much I myself will marry (get married to a woman) in the near future. Have you not seen the state of my teeth? &amp;gt; I married two wonderful people on St. Valentine's Day

Polygamy! Well I never. Your vision of me is obviously wrong! I'm 'trim' with recently cut long hair and as evidenced by the photo I'm not terribly tall, but shure I don't give a shite about it. I had a fantastically great time with the couple and their friends from all over who came to the wedding.

^^They ^^bought ^^me ^^a ^^year ^^of ^^reddit ^^gold! ^^^Woohoo! I am still in shock your a reverend. So if I die, while we are still redditors I expect you to be at my funeral telling my parish priest to Fuck off and bury me without all that crap. I want teenage kicks being played while I am going into the ground. 

I will be the funeral of your bucketlist. I'm an ordained Reverend Doctor with the U.L.C. and [this song, *I did it my way*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD0eb0tDjIk) is what I want played at my funeral. Ha Sid. My ex husband was a proper mochian, safety pins in his ears wearing punk. He spent many nights in the 100 Club.  100 club in London? I've been to some great gigs there.... Yep. So did he. Then he discovered heroin.   A few questions. How did you get to be a "reverend", are the weddings legal and did you leave home dressed as a reverend/how does your Ma react? We need answers!!!!  The public have a right to know.  Frankly I am shocked. I was even more shocked in my drunken stupor last night. And there is evidence that he answers to the name "Father".

Witnesses say when asked *more wine Father* that he said *Yes*. Yes, I want to know why he is a Reverand, how he became one and should Niamhish apply to be his Mrs Doyle. We deserve to know and the world deserves to know if Niamhish can make cups of tea on demand.  I don't think she can, but I am sue she can make hot whiskey instead or Jack and coke. It's a holy calling. A few questions. How did you get to be a "reverend", are the weddings legal and did you leave home dressed as a reverend/how does your Ma react? I was ordained on www.ulc.org The wedding is not legal in Ireland but would be in certain states of the US, they will marry on their return to Pennsylvania in a registry office. I did leave home dressed as a reverend and it was odd seeing the double takes from people as I was rolling my ciggies in various places. People were very deferential to me and the best was the Italian MD. My ma is in Spain but I did text her a photo, they'll be sending pics of the ceremony when they get back to the States.

My own job in a multinational may not get filled in Ireland.

The TV News yesterday told me there would be an open vacancy in Rome at the end of the month.  I looked into the main legal requirements of the job, which appear to need the post to be filled by a single, Catholic bloke.  Grand, I thought, I can fit the bill. Perks of the job, included your own country, free accommodation and a car(some popemobile model I never heard off, but what the hell it comes with the job)

I went online to try and find where to send my CV, and it turns out that they are not accepting applications.  Instead of the standard Irish job application process, in sending your CV and then your Uncle who knows somebody putting in a good word for you, they have some weird foreign process....

After a bit of research I found out who gets the job will be decided by 118 auld fellas who will be locked, or locked in or something, and you can't even get an interview in front of them.  Worst of all, none of my Uncles know any of them, not even some bloke call Brady who lives in Armagh.

I thought I was well scuppered, when I remember this educational DVD I have, something about good parenting (No idea why I have it, it's not as if I have any children).  It included a section on "How to make an offer he cannot refuse."

I found the DVD to watch and learn how to persuade these 118 auld fellas to give me the job.  It appears the throwing a bit of horse meat on their bed is the best method.

I am sure, you have figured out where this is going now.  I popped into my local Tesco, only to find out they can't sell me horse meat after the Department of Agriculture stuck their bloody interfering nose in!

I have racked my brain but still have no idea how to put my name forward for the new job.

How is the country going move forward if our own fecking Government is block us getting jobs???

Some bloke at work said the good parenting III dvd has some help on how to do things in the Vatican, but I have not looked that up yet.

If any of you have any suggestions I would appreciate the help.

  Ha, very good.

I know a fellow who knows a fellow, who's uncle is the door man of the place where the auld fellows are locked in, I will tell him to put a word in for you.  Sorry lad, I've taken that post.

My uncle is Jesus. Fair play to you lad....

If Jesus was your uncle, I assume you are of a certain age.

Can you name me as your successor?  If you do that you would be a saint and I will name you as such if I can when I take over. 

Making me Pope is surely a miraculous act so you would be a shoo in...  </snippet></document><document><title>Trace elements of beef and pork have been found in my horse meat.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/18cgzz/trace_elements_of_beef_and_pork_have_been_found/</url><snippet>I don't know what to believe anymore.

There's no known cure.  Are you sure that you are not a vegetarian. I know some vegetarians that are really upset about the horsemeat and it not like they even eat burgers.

I'm looking at the possibility of truffles, shittake and chanterelle mushrooms. None of that magick mushroom stuff, but then again.... We don't want none of your fancy stuff here, button mushrooms all the way. Broaden your tastebud horizons you heathen!

Irish truffles currently sell for &#8364;400p/kilo. Money for jam except I'll have to get a truffle dog and train the feckin' thing. Do truffles grow in Ireland? A certain "celeb" chef has a pig for truffle hunting. So my son told me.  They do. Truffle dogs are better as they don't eat the truffles. With truffle pigs you have to grab the truffles before the pig eats them. Can you explain to our gentle readers which part of the pig, when grabbed, is most effective in dissuading the pig from eating the truffle and your resultant reticence at engaging with the pig in the truffle hunt. Dear gentle somnulent readers:

When dealing with a rampant truffle pig you need to grab the greedy feckin' bastard by its snout and direct it away from the black/white gold that are truffles. The porcine snout is the most sensitive of man's domestication of farmyard animals (I'm making this up as I go along, I have no facts to substantiate my claims).


Edit: In two years I'll have to buy a feckin' truffle dog and train it. You have pig snout phobia ? They do. Truffle dogs are better as they don't eat the truffles. With truffle pigs you have to grab the truffles before the pig eats them.  I'm more upset about the ash trees dying. Kinda sad.  What did you do with all the courgettes?

Ah German, never did it, I did OL French so it was one of the nicer exams. I'm a straight A English student. I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll keep at it.



I regret not doing French. Tres sexy. [Yeah but once you can say this your grand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQa7SvVCdZk)

Oh fuck that thunder!I see why you're scared. That and a whole lot more of French filth ;)



I need a thunder buddy.  :( [Fuck you thunder, you can suck my dick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVb2vkfw6bw)

I'll be your thunder buddy :) Yay, thunder buddies! How did it go? English is all about bullshitting though.

Ah German, never did it, I did OL French so it was one of the nicer exams. I got an NG on my LC for German, all I wrote on the exam paper was my name. My folks were none to happy at paying IR&#163;75 for me to get my Matric to get into UCD. What you used to have to write your name??  

What's the Matric? I tried Googling it but I was just finding llinks to some New Zealand exam. In ye ancient olden times of yore we had to write our names and answer questions on parchment using a quill and ink. 'Twas before anonymous student numbers you young'uns have now. It was also the era of corporal punishment 'for your own good'. I got thumped the odd time but I was wise and smart enough to avoid it mostly. I saw some serious violent shit in my time in school.

The 'Matric' was/is(?) the Matriculation exam for universities. You'd get it automatically if you passed all your LC exams. I didn't, hence the IR&#163;75, which was a fortune back in '85. Ah yeah my auld wan is always going on about how the nuns used to slap her wrists and palms with a ruler if she took too long bringing the coal in from the shed back when she was a babby.

I think that still exists?Not sure, but it sounds familiar.  Your Mam got off easy. I have a horror story to tell from when I was ~7 years of age. Thinking back on the incident now still traumatises me.  You are a girl and should be fine.

When I was a lad a friend of mine got the mocks and his glands swelled up very painfully and he had to stay in a dark room.

So the rumours are true that he has become a showband.Is it to coincide with his next release *its a long way to Tipperary*  ? The rumours are true, I think he is going to be the new Kilkenny mascot. He's not tough enough to be the Limerick mascot.  He's not tough enough to be the Limerick mascot.  Who needs tough when you've got a knife. But is he tough enough to eat a Tesco burger. 

Big Tom would eat a Tesco burger. Is he as tough as a Tesco burger? He's not tough enough to be the Limerick mascot.  Who is?

But I'm dealing with it in the healthy Irish way. Silently seething with hatred.

Everything's bollocks. Enda Kenny is a system of wood blocks connected by well oiled hinges and manipulated carefully through a sequence of strings. David Cameron as well. They're all wood.

Northern Ireland's shite.

Weather's shite.

I've no real job so I have to work for my da for peanuts a day.

I live in the backarse of nowhere.

Universities are too slow sending me offers.

I don't know where my life is going, but I'd quite like to end it in a brawl with someone.

I have no friends, but I do have a lot of people who like to pretend they're my friends in order to get things off me.

I'd like to be a soldier, but the only armed forces I can join are Brits. Feckin' Brits.


My best friend's a woman, but she's met some bollocks and I'm that jealous a knobhead I can't get past the fact she's seeing someone. I don't even understand why I'm jealous. Also she lives in another country. Bollocks.

I can't get drunk without whinging about my problems. 

Worst of all, I know all my problems are insignificant as christ, and I still can't get over them.

So aye. Beat that there. 

  This...this *beautiful* rant right here...*this* is why these very halls of Irish misery were constructed. I would make you a personalised flair if I wasn't completely hammered out of my trousers.

We that are here to piss and moan *Salute You*! *To complain and serve.*  If you're interested in a military career you could always join the [French Foreign Legion](http://www.legion-recrute.com/en/) though:

&amp;gt; If your candidature is upheld, the first contract is minimum for 5 years

I've met quite a few Irish Legionnaires and they're really sound blokes.  Thanks, but I've already considered the FFL, and I've weighed it up against the Royal Marines, but they just don't come out on top.

I want to get my degree before I commit a chunk of my life to military service, so I might as well use it to apply to become an officer, rather than enlist. Better pay, and the Brits will give me a bursary for part of my student loan. Also, the RM new officers minimum commitment is only three years, so if it turns out to be a balls then I won't have wasted too much time.

Plus it's harder to get in, so if I do make it through application and training then I'll have a serious sense of achievement. What would your mammy say about you running of and joining the British army? Navy, actually, and she's probably be none to amused, but I don't care. Tut tut Meh. I'll be 22 by the time I apply, I think my mammy will just be glad I'm not moving back in with her. 

As for the fact that it's the Brits... I don't really mind. As long as it's not the parachute regiment. If anything I'm following in the footsteps of a ton of republicans. Tom Barry was in the British expeditionary force in Mesopotamia. James Connolly fought in the British Army. It's not a big deal for me.

 No no no all British people are oppressive tyrants whose very existence is consumed by the need to rape and pillage our lands. Didn't you do history in school?  I think most of the top half of your comment would apply to most people our age.

&amp;gt;My best friend's a woman, but she's met some bollocks and I'm that jealous a knobhead I can't get past the fact she's seeing someone. I don't even understand why I'm jealous

Have you considered the fact that you might have feelings for her?

&amp;gt;I can't get drunk without whinging about my problems.

Again that's most people.

&amp;gt;I have no friends, but I do have a lot of people who like to pretend they're my friends in order to get things off me.

I know that feel bro. I have feelings, but they're going nowhere. It would never work out. I'd much prefer to keep my one decent friend. One who doesn't take my weed.



 Well being in another country would make that hard to do. You need to start saying you don't have any, everyone knows that. Aye, but I'm so generous when I'm drunk. Sometimes when I'm drunk I buy a bag of chips and just walk around feeding them to strangers. I just want to help people...

Then I wake up poor and angry. I think you're just describing me at this point. Also I keep making people dinner and sandwiches, sober like, just want them to appreciate me :( Why don't people love us?

Seriously... I buy rounds, bring the bag, I drag them out of fights, I make sure they get into taxis when they're covered in their own boke...

Yet at the end of the night it's always me wondering why I even bothered. I don't know, for me I think they used to like me and now they just *put up* with me, and reap the benefits of being my friends. I mean the people in college are grand, sure they let me cook dinner but they'll always return the favour but at home...No idk what changed but I constantly just feel like no one could give a shit if I was there or not. Sorry... I just... this is really weird. That's exactly how I feel.

I didn't go to uni with everyone else, so I've basically become estranged from all my friends, but occasionally they come back, and although they're friendly and nice and all, I really feel like either they don't want me there or they don't care I'm there at all.

It sucks, because they have their new friends, but I have no one. So I end up trying to fill in the gaps with 'imaginary' friendships on the internet. I get deeply involved in my little subreddits, and for a while it feels like I really belong again, sharing the inside jokes, talking about things people outside those communities wouldn't understand, but at the end of the night I'm still lying in bed wondering how it all got so... pathetic.

Probably why I'm avoiding lying in bed.

Part of it is the rural thing. People talk about rural isolation and suicide like it's something that only happens to older people who can't go outside anymore. I'm 19 years old, not some old man from Kerry.  It's a horrible feeling, thinking people would just be happier if you stopped talking to them. The thing is I would understand if this happened when we all went off to college but this started like a year ago out of nowhere. It's like I did something to piss everyone off but no one told me what. 

You avoid going to bed, I avoid getting out of it. You're never a loser in your dreams. Or at least you can try and pretend your life isn't falling to pieces. 

I'm not rurally isolated, just socially. But yeah I get that living in the back arse of nowhere would be hard. 

Main thing for YOU to remember is you'll be off to college next year, you can make all these new friends then.  The Roid rage is what spurned Lance Armstrong on to win 7 Tours de France and a place on the couch with Oprah but it can get out of control.

For gods sake lad , give the steroids up, you dont even own a bike.

 If there's one thing I've learned from Lance Armstrong, it's that taking drugs will make you famous, no matter how little anyone cares about your sport.  I think I love you. 


'Sall. I'll just casually continue about my day. Chin up love, it could be worse. You could be from Kerry. I swear to god, the next person who falls in love with me is getting a slap. ...a slap where?! ;)


This is the decider. Augh. *hugs*   In fairness these problems of yours are pretty first world, which is ironic as you have Cork for your flair. EDIT; my mistake, you're a Derry man, which as of the last couple of weeks, as everybody knows, is one of the cultural capitals of the western world. 

Edit: I thought this was a different thread.

Yeah Derry is nice and all. Not a job in it though.



 You could always just move down the road to Strabane.</snippet></document><document><title>I gorged on a tub of sour jellies, now my mouth stings and it's hard to drink tea</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/irishproblems/comments/17e3k5/i_gorged_on_a_tub_of_sour_jellies_now_my_mouth/</url><snippet>  It'll pass.
