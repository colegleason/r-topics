Here are the three strategies I've seen for reducing the weight of the final exam, and their difficulties:\n\n1. Make the final optional (possibly only for students with X grade in the class already), or don't have a final exam at all (have a project or something instead). I've seen this work in small classes (both in high school and college), but it is predicated on the instructor having enough other information to assign a grade. This can be very challenging in larger courses that have fewer exams (aspects of which I'll address in points 2 and 3). This can also mean that material towards the end of the course isn't covered by any exam (and, unfortunately, is often learned less thoroughly)\n\n2. Place a larger emphasis on assignments. I did this over the summer. One reason this is difficult is cheating/plagiarism. The unfortunate state of the world is that some students will attempt to take advantage of the system, to the detriment of themselves and others. An exam is a much more controlled environment than any other assessment, so it is much easier to prevent and detect cheating. Since CS has pretty good tools for detecting plagiarism, I wasn't overly concerned with this aspect. However, what was not apparent to me before teaching the course, was the level of grade inflation on assignments. Scores on labs/homeworks are often 100%, and generally much, much higher than exam scores. I think this is partially the result of the amount of help available on assignments - there are TAs, the instructor, and other students who can all help each other through the assignments. Now, I believe this is definitely a good thing! It is much, much better in terms of learning to complete an assignment well with help than to only partially complete it. However, when done incorrectly this can lead to high homework scores without necessarily gaining an understanding of the material. I believe this is the reason most classes weigh exams so heavily - instructors can control what goes on during an exam, but not what goes on outside of the class when students do homework (which is fine when homework is used primarily for learning rather than assessment).\n\n3. Have more exams, so that each can be worth less. I did this during the summer - we had 4 exams (including the final), each worth 15% of the grade (and the final was only two hours). I didn't want any single exam to have such high stakes, and the more frequent exams means it's harder for students to go for a long period of time without reviewing the material (if you stop paying attention for 3 weeks, you might be able to catch up before the exam, but if you stop paying attention for 5 weeks, you're pretty much screwed). I think this was a great success overall. I think the reason this isn't done more often is that writing good exams is HARD. I spent more time writing the exams than I would usually put into studying for one, and I had two awesome course assistants helping me write them. Administering the exam is also takes up a whole day, and grading the exam is incredibly time consuming. That said, I think it was worth it.\n\nIf you want to change the system, I think you should focus on method 3. Method 1 and 2 have serious drawbacks and are a very hard sell to instructors (although they can be great in some courses). Method 3 takes work, but has a lot of positives, and, most importantly, asking for it makes you appear hardworking rather than lazy, which might go a long way towards getting your points taken seriously.\n\n_Side note: The students I had over the summer were great and put an amazing amount of effort into a crazy timeline, and definitely earned their grades, which I don't believe ended up being inflated compared to the fall/spring semester.
