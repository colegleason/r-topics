Some myths can be dispelled pretty easily, but there are some things I'd really like the police to answer. \n\n1. Champaign compiles those stats in January every year, but records show it's been between 1,000-1,200 each year since 2008, when they cut down on patrols doing the barchecks instead (more on that later). At $320 each, that converted to $370,000 in ticket revenue in 2011 (1157 tickets). I'm too lazy to find Urbana, but they run liquor enforcement kind of randomly since there's no big bar scene there.\n\n2. I don't know, but there are ways to find out. Crimereports.com lets you go back to June right now, and I can't filter by the University Police's beat... but it's about 280 for this [little horizontal slice](http://imgur.com/aUgDu). There's also the school's [Clery Act report](http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf), which could be unmitigated bullshit -- 14 assaults reported in 2011, which I think is probably a low estimate. \n\n3. A few days ago, I would have said don't walk home drunk alone or wear headphones blasting music, but now I have to add, \"Don't get into your car right outside of Grainger at 8 p.m.\" Perhaps a can of bear mace wouldn't hurt either. \n\n4. **They do not focus on underage drinking.** It might look like they pull officers from their routine patrols to nail students, but the liquor enforcement is just a fun, safe way for 4-5 cops to rack up overtime hours at $52/hr (on average). There's no full-time staff with the Champaign Police that runs the bar raids. Now whether it's wise for them to spend overtime hours on raiding the bars and making around $16 for the city for every $1 they spend rather than patrolling the areas that have seen more crime recently... is kind of a loaded question, but it could be a valid one. The first thing you would want to know is how many overtime hours are spent on extra patrols.\n*Campus police don't directly participate in bar raids*, but the Illinois State Police will often join in.\n\n5. You might want to call the campus police chief [Jeff Christensen](http://dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/staffdirectory.html) and ask him yourself. Hopefully he'll have an answer for you. If not, keep going down the list. And then you can post it here!", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a police officer, but I can answer a few of these. Some myths can be dispelled pretty easily, but there are some things I&amp;#39;d really like the police to answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champaign compiles those stats in January every year, but records show it&amp;#39;s been between 1,000-1,200 each year since 2008, when they cut down on patrols doing the barchecks instead (more on that later). At $320 each, that converted to $370,000 in ticket revenue in 2011 (1157 tickets). I&amp;#39;m too lazy to find Urbana, but they run liquor enforcement kind of randomly since there&amp;#39;s no big bar scene there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, but there are ways to find out. Crimereports.com lets you go back to June right now, and I can&amp;#39;t filter by the University Police&amp;#39;s beat... but it&amp;#39;s about 280 for this &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/aUgDu\"&gt;little horizontal slice&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#39;s also the school&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf\"&gt;Clery Act report&lt;/a&gt;, which could be unmitigated bullshit -- 14 assaults reported in 2011, which I think is probably a low estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I would have said don&amp;#39;t walk home drunk alone or wear headphones blasting music, but now I have to add, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t get into your car right outside of Grainger at 8 p.m.&amp;quot; Perhaps a can of bear mace wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They do not focus on underage drinking.&lt;/strong&gt; It might look like they pull officers from their routine patrols to nail students, but the liquor enforcement is just a fun, safe way for 4-5 cops to rack up overtime hours at $52/hr (on average). There&amp;#39;s no full-time staff with the Champaign Police that runs the bar raids. Now whether it&amp;#39;s wise for them to spend overtime hours on raiding the bars and making around $16 for the city for every $1 they spend rather than patrolling the areas that have seen more crime recently... is kind of a loaded question, but it could be a valid one. The first thing you would want to know is how many overtime hours are spent on extra patrols.\n&lt;em&gt;Campus police don&amp;#39;t directly participate in bar raids&lt;/em&gt;, but the Illinois State Police will often join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might want to call the campus police chief &lt;a href=\"http://dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/staffdirectory.html\"&gt;Jeff Christensen&lt;/a&gt; and ask him yourself.

While our target audience is primarily engineering students and recent graduates, we hope our advice can be applicable to most anyone else!\n\nWe've made a few posts on Reddit already. Read 'em over if you're curious. They're [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/), [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ygye/we_are_a_group_of_engineering_recruiters_ask_us/), and [all the way over here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/14qu7l/add_meat_to_your_resume_by_avoiding_one_simple/)\n\nWe have started a newsletter which talks about the biggest problems we see and other thoughts that career centers might not put forth, so if you like what we have to say, check us out! [careerpigeon.com](http://www.careerpigeon.com)\n\nAs for this thread, we will be checking it throughout the day. \n\nAsk us anything!

Your choices on this thread, alone, are reason enough for no one to take you serious. You did a bad thing and you should feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Your reasoning behind not accepting photo ID&amp;#39;s against a manifest as it would be &amp;#39;entirely too time-consuming&amp;#39; is a logical fallacy. Stop being stupid. Furthermore, no one is arguing the policy about possessing a copy of the ticket in-hand but, instead, that you seemingly refuse to utilize the numerous and equally valid alternatives that exist. Your lack of willingness to embrace new ideas and (actually) listen to valid complaints is discouraging. Not to mention a poor business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III.) This is why companies have PR and/or adequately trained, competent individuals to handle their complaint responses. Your efforts to respond to and defend SEx&amp;#39;s honor against a post from a disgruntled customer were wholly lost on your inability to forcibly remove your cranial compartment from your rectal cavity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c7j22pi", "flair_text": null, "created": 1355932177.0, "created_utc": 1355928577.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 6, "link_id": "t3_1524mm", "children": [], "author": "iphonephotog", "id": "c7itjcb", "parent_id": "t3_1524mm", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 8, "body": "Suburban Express sucks.
