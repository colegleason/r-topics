Its a dirty little secret of HR that If you are not white, be ready to have to deal with that bias even if it is unfair.  Its not that employers don't trust you, its that they don't trust anybody.

You may be tempted to stretch the truth a little to get your start; DO NOT DO THIS as it will poison you and make you toxic down the road.\n\n2. Dirty little secret #1 is that it doesn't matter if the guy actually has a CS degree or not.  If you have a Math degree or a hard science degree, its really all the same.  Now this doesn't work if you have a liberal arts degree or a degree in \"woman's studies\" because all we care about is if the person is smart.  But having the degree in science, tech, engineering, math (STEM), helps prove that.  The rest is just paperwork and experience because either you are smart enough or you are not.\n\n3. Your education does not stop after university/collage.  If you think so, don't even bother going into CS.  You will spend thousands of dollars and countless sleepless hours every year to maintain and RE GET your computer science education every year after you graduate.  If you do not, you will lose out and eventually not be somebody anybody will want to hire.  You will also need to learn new languages languages all the time,  bare minimal 1 every 2 years and that is pushing it on how slow you are being at reeducating yourself.\n\n4.

Other than some basics, your professors will likely focus on concepts and leave implementation to be a self directed activity. If this bothers you, you are may not be cut out for CS.\n\nFocus on taking the classes where you will learn the most. Never ever take classes based on how easy it is to get a grade in them. It is much more important to learn a lot than to worry about grades. The ideal scenario here is to take a class where you push yourself to learn, and still get great grades. It is very doable. Don't take short cuts in learning. ( e.g. See: Which is more beneficial to learn as a first programming language, Java or C++? Why? ).\n\nAlways try to build a unified view of computer science various different classes that you take. Your Theory of Computation class can teach you something valuable for your Compilers class. Your algorithms class is related to your graphics class. Your graphics class is related to your linear algebra class. As and when there is an overlap of knowledge in different classes, use that overlap to your advantage to continually reinforce your learning. Pre conditions and post conditions you learn about in correctness proofs of programs map directly to asserts. Keep on collecting pieces of the puzzle and keep putting them together.\n\nDo not sacrifice theoretical learning for implementation centric learning, and vice versa. They are both duals of each other, and not at odds with each other.

Some Dijkstra lectures I attended still echo in my head\n\n  \n&gt; by Kartik Ayyar,from Quora.com", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not expect you will be give much instruction about how to program in a CS school. Other than some basics, your professors will likely focus on concepts and leave implementation to be a self directed activity. If this bothers you, you are may not be cut out for CS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focus on taking the classes where you will learn the most. Never ever take classes based on how easy it is to get a grade in them. It is much more important to learn a lot than to worry about grades. The ideal scenario here is to take a class where you push yourself to learn, and still get great grades. It is very doable. Don&amp;#39;t take short cuts in learning. ( e.g. See: Which is more beneficial to learn as a first programming language, Java or C++? Why? ).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always try to build a unified view of computer science various different classes that you take. Your Theory of Computation class can teach you something valuable for your Compilers class. Your algorithms class is related to your graphics class. Your graphics class is related to your linear algebra class. As and when there is an overlap of knowledge in different classes, use that overlap to your advantage to continually reinforce your learning. Pre conditions and post conditions you learn about in correctness proofs of programs map directly to asserts. Keep on collecting pieces of the puzzle and keep putting them together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not sacrifice theoretical learning for implementation centric learning, and vice versa. They are both duals of each other, and not at odds with each other. If you sacrifice theory, it will deprive you of a much needed analytical framework to rigorously scrutinize the complexity of algorithms.

Here are the basic rules we use. I don't know what language or platform you are using so this is going to be generic.\n\n* Define your interface flow base upon the culture you are writing for. North Americans read left to right top to bottom. Thus the upper left corner will be the first place they look so put information about where they are at there. They will return to this point when they are lost. in Japan it is the same for horizontal writing left to right then up to down, but for vertical writing it is up to down then right to left. Thus the upper right corner would be a better place for a navigation system.\n\n* Style EVERYTHING. use CSS on all objects, when we start web interfaces we create a generic class for all form objects. When we need a more specific type we create another class for it. ALWAYS set the class when you create the object. Thus when your client decides to change your colour scheme it is easy.\n\n* Don't use default colours. It is easy to get great colour pallets. Here this program gives you a colour pallet based upon an image. http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/ It is common for me to give the client pictures and say which one tickles your fancy for colour. This one is more technical http://colorschemedesigner.com/ We use this one when we are dealing with colour tone.\n\n* Use borders, and panels to collect ideas into a similar location. Use colour to denote similar information on different forms.\n\n* Strive for consistency. Make sure if you put your OK, Cancel in the lower right that they stay there AND never become Cancel, OK.\n\n* Use  Shortcuts. People when they get started on an app love it when the app helps them get to the end point. They get frustrated after the Nth time they have to do the same operation via multiple screens or a wizard. Allow your users to grow with your app making it easier for them to shortcut to the end point. This may mean you have to have another page that consolidates multiple screens into a single screen but your are writing N-Tier anyways are you not ;) Keyboard shortcuts for the web are done with the onkeypress-DOM and JQUERY has a great method for implementing this.\n\n* Make sure you give feedback early and often. For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, while for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial.\n\n* Look at other interfaces and mimic them. Your client wants the app to look like Outlook. Make it look like outlook. \n\n* Look deeply at interfaces and define what you like and don't like about it and use what you like.\n\nThere is a lot more that we could go into, but the cardinal rule of interface design is \"A user interface is well-designed when the program behaves exactly how the user thought it would.\" This goes for the application look and feel as well So get users testing your interface early and often.

Many companies treat it as nothing more then disposable cheap labor while others want to become an integral part of your education. Some might put you through the same rigorous process they use for full time hires while others might just look at your grades and call it a day. \n\nSo with that major caveat out of the way, I can give you some tips based on our own hiring process. We actually *do* try to put some care and thought in it and we review it on at least a yearly basis. \n\nFirst off, grades. We wish it didn't have to come to this but there's just too many applicants to sort through, so we need some really basic initial weeding-out mechanism we can farm out to HR, and that would be grades. You don't have to have fantastic grades but you shouldn't have too many bad ones. Relevant extracurricular experience *might* save you, but it's a crapshoot. You hear people saying grades don't really matter after you graduate and possibly this is true, but yeah sorry, before you graduate they do matter, at least a little.\n\nIf it doesn't look like you're struggling with grades, the very very next thing we look at is general programming ability. This is probably the most important thing you should work on. Do you want to be a programmer? Go program. Program all the time. Doesn't matter what or why, just keep working on stuff. Computer science curricula are shockingly light on actual programming assignments so this is something you *absolutely must* work on on your own if you want to get into programming. You can keep going into the academic post-graduate study track instead which actually works out really well for many people, but if programming is what you actually want to do, you just have to program. \n\nDon't sweat C++ (btw, you know who uses C++? *THE WHOLE GAMING INDUSTRY*, plenty of work there). It really *really* doesn't matter what technology you're playing with, if we see you're doing a lot of programming work we're gonna like you. Scheme and Haskell are effectively useless outside of academia but we still like seeing them on your project list. We also really love open source contributions, and those can come in many different flavors. We also really love experience with practical programming tools. How's your linux? Your regex + grep? Git?  All these things show us you're the kind of person that actually programs.\n\nAgain, this all comes down to general programing ability. I think just about any half-competent company is going to have a programming test during the interview (we certainly do). Watching you work through a simple assignment (even something like \"write a function to reverse a string\" or \"write a program that outputs the grade school multiplication table to N\") will let us know right away if you can actually program or not. Trust me, it's really easy to tell. We even find it super easy to spot if you simply happen to have memorized this particular problem ;) \n\nThat's about all we care about. Doesn't suck at school, can program. Pretty simple eh? Any specific technology we can pretty much teach you on the job. It's nice when somebody happens to be familiar with the tech stack we happen to use right off the bat, but that's just a nice little extra bonus sugar on top.

I read it 4 years ago and it basically changed me as a developer. It is an amazing book in its own regard, but it has a relevant bit about tools, namely that the Unix philosophy is *amazing* for programmers, if you know how to use it.\n\nI had the following problem: I had a folder with images, but some of them were (incorrectly) labeled as .png, while they were actually .jpg. However, IrfanView couldn't rename them, as an image with the same name already existed. It wasn't really a problem, it just annoyed me. So I used Cygwin to scratch that itch.\n\nFirst, I used `find` to find all .png's in the folder:\n\n    find *.png\n\nThen I piped that output to `sed` to rename them to .jpg.\n\n    find *.png | sed s/.png/.jpg/\n\nNow came the tricky part. For every line, we have to know if the file exists and if so, remove it. Luckily, bash supports for loops:\n\n    for fn in `find *.png | sed s/.png/.jpg/`; do [ -f \"$fn\" ] &amp;&amp; rm -f \"$fn\"; do\n\nThe end result? A script that finds all .png's in a folder, renames them to .jpg, checks if that .jpg exists and if so, removes it. A job that would have taken me an hour or more by hand done in a 15-minute script. And it only took so long because I wasn't used to the for loop syntax of Bash.\n\nAnd I've been doing that in other parts of my coding life too. Visual Studio has support for regular expressions, so why not use that? It just has a syntax that is quite-like-but-not-really Perl syntax.\n\nFor a project I need to know the start and end points of the unicode map. So I've put them all in defines, like so:\n\n    #define FUNICODE_BASIC_LATIN                                     1  // 0x0000 - 0x007F\n    #define FUNICODE_LATIN_SUPPLEMENT                                2  // 0x0080 - 0x00FF\n    #define FUNICODE_LATIN_EXTENDED_A                                3  // 0x0100 - 0x017F\n\nBut now I need them in this fashion:\n\n\tm_UnicodeRangeStart[ 1] = 0x0000; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 1] = 0x007F; // FUNICODE_BASIC_LATIN\n\tm_UnicodeRangeStart[ 2] = 0x0080; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 2] = 0x00FF; // FUNICODE_LATIN_SUPPLEMENT\n\tm_UnicodeRangeStart[ 3] = 0x0100; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 3] = 0x017F; // FUNICODE_LATIN_EXTENDED_A\n\nSo I wrote a \"simple\" regular expression:\n\n    \\#define {.#} #{:z} #\\/\\/ {.#} \\- {.*}\n\nThis looks like garbage, I know. But what it does:\n\n* Look for \"#define \".\n* Find the first group of any characters, non-greedy up to \" \".\n* Skip a non-greedy amount of spaces.\n* Put an integer in the second group.\n* Skip a non-greedy amount of spaces.\n* Find the start of a comment, \"//\"\n* Put a non-greedy amount of \"any character\" in group three.\n* Skip the \" - \" bit.\n* Put a greedy amount of \"any character\" in group four.\n\nNow we have four groups:\n\n1. Name of the define\n2. Value of the define\n3. Start of the range\n4. End of the range\n\nAnd we can put that in the replace field:\n\n    m_UnicodeRangeStart[\\2] = \\3; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[\\2] = \\4; // \\1\n\nAgain, this saves me hours of manual labor. Both now and in the future, when I expand the list of defines. Because now I can just take the list of defines, copy them in my .cpp and run the regex-replace. All because I took the time to learn the syntax of Visual Studio's regex function.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is: don't get caught up in a particular editor or technology or language or design pattern. New ones will come along all the time and it's up to you to use your tools to the fullest extent. Know what's out there and make an effort to learn how to use it.\n\nRight now I could take a job in C++ (which is what I specialize in), C, Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript, Bash scripting, AutoIt scripting, Lua. Why? Because *I've tried them all*. I may not be an expert in any of them, but I know how to use their tools.\n\nFinally, let me close with an amazing article that is in tune with the pragmatic programmer philosophy:\n\nhttp://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the Pragmatic Programmer. I read it 4 years ago and it basically changed me as a developer. It is an amazing book in its own regard, but it has a relevant bit about tools, namely that the Unix philosophy is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; for programmers, if you know how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the following problem: I had a folder with images, but some of them were (incorrectly) labeled as .png, while they were actually .jpg. However, IrfanView couldn&amp;#39;t rename them, as an image with the same name already existed. It wasn&amp;#39;t really a problem, it just annoyed me. So I used Cygwin to scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I used &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to find all .png&amp;#39;s in the folder:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;find *.png\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I piped that output to &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; to rename them to .jpg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;find *.png | sed s/.png/.jpg/\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now came the tricky part. For every line, we have to know if the file exists and if so, remove it. Luckily, bash supports for loops:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for fn in `find *.png | sed s/.png/.jpg/`; do [ -f &amp;quot;$fn&amp;quot; ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -f &amp;quot;$fn&amp;quot;; do\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end result? A script that finds all .png&amp;#39;s in a folder, renames them to .jpg, checks if that .jpg exists and if so, removes it. A job that would have taken me an hour or more by hand done in a 15-minute script. And it only took so long because I wasn&amp;#39;t used to the for loop syntax of Bash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve been doing that in other parts of my coding life too. Visual Studio has support for regular expressions, so why not use that? It just has a syntax that is quite-like-but-not-really Perl syntax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a project I need to know the start and end points of the unicode map. So I&amp;#39;ve put them all in defines, like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define FUNICODE_BASIC_LATIN                                     1  // 0x0000 - 0x007F\n#define FUNICODE_LATIN_SUPPLEMENT                                2  // 0x0080 - 0x00FF\n#define FUNICODE_LATIN_EXTENDED_A                                3  // 0x0100 - 0x017F\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I need them in this fashion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_UnicodeRangeStart[ 1] = 0x0000; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 1] = 0x007F; // FUNICODE_BASIC_LATIN\nm_UnicodeRangeStart[ 2] = 0x0080; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 2] = 0x00FF; // FUNICODE_LATIN_SUPPLEMENT\nm_UnicodeRangeStart[ 3] = 0x0100; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[ 3] = 0x017F; // FUNICODE_LATIN_EXTENDED_A\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; regular expression:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\\#define {.#} #{:z} #\\/\\/ {.#} \\- {.*}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This looks like garbage, I know. But what it does:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Look for &amp;quot;#define &amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Find the first group of any characters, non-greedy up to &amp;quot; &amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skip a non-greedy amount of spaces.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Put an integer in the second group.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skip a non-greedy amount of spaces.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Find the start of a comment, &amp;quot;//&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Put a non-greedy amount of &amp;quot;any character&amp;quot; in group three.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skip the &amp;quot; - &amp;quot; bit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Put a greedy amount of &amp;quot;any character&amp;quot; in group four.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have four groups:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Name of the define&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Value of the define&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Start of the range&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;End of the range&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we can put that in the replace field:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_UnicodeRangeStart[\\2] = \\3; m_UnicodeRangeEnd[\\2] = \\4; // \\1\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, this saves me hours of manual labor.
