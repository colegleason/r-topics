That will not increase LEX's probability of being invited to resume operations, regardless of what the 600 pages, which the LEX dog apparently ate, have to say.\n\n- If you buy a ticket from LEX at this point, you are a fool. They have probably collected $50k-$100k in revenue for trips they have not yet operated. It's unlikely they have liquid assets sufficient to meet final payroll and provide refunds for everyone. So if you bought a ticket before this all went down, you're probably not getting a refund. But there's nothing you can do. Buying a ticket now, however, would be extremely foolish. You're already on notice that LEX cannot operate! If you buy a ticket now, you are just throwing money down a hole.\n\n- The reason LEX is shut down is that they have CHRONIC maintenance and compliance issues. No pile of excuses, not even 600 pages worth, can possibly cancel out LEX's history with DOT. LEX is foolish for holding out hope that DOT will give them a reprieve.\n\n- DOT is engaged in political theatre. Quinn sent LaHood a letter asking that DOT investigate IL bus companies, so that he looks like he cares that Megabus keeps killing IL citizens (3 in the last year or so). LaHood has responded by sending out a posse, with the goal of taking VISIBLE, media-friendly action against some bus companies. According to FOX32, they went after Megabus and LEX. Megabus carries thousands, employs hundreds, has deep pockets and has probably made some nontrivial political contributions. LEX, on the other hand, is a little \"downstate\" cockroach with no connections. So, if you want to make an example of someone, who you gonna go after? LEX, of course. LEX is being sacrificed at the Media Altar to make the public think that DOT is effective and the public is safe. Shutting down LEX is a nice, tidy melodrama for the public, with no potential backlash for DOT.\n\n- As for Suburban, their website has suddenly lost a lot of its personality. The bad check page is gone, avoid-lex.com is now a Viagara advertisement, and I heard the owner was at a spa today. Just kidding about the last part. But maybe they're relieved that they don't have to duke it out with LEX anymore. As for me, I'm going to miss their entertaining posters. I never understood why people pretend to be offended - those posters are very funny, even the nasty ones.\n\n- I also noticed that the IL Shuttle website says something about reduced fares coming. Maybe they're going to crank up their frequency or run buses more frequently (rather than those big blue vans) or something which requires more riders. Think price elasticity...Econ 101.\n\n- Peoria is in trouble. If you google peoria charter winkler and look at articles and letter to the editor in the Peoria Journal Star, you'll find owner Winkler whining about how bad business has been (at least 2 articles) and asking oil companies to do their patriotic duty and reduce fuel prices. He seems like a dolt. His grandpa worked hard to build a business, and now he's doing a great job destroying it. They're circling the drain, IMHO. Everyone at Peoria has been sipping the \"we're great\" kool-aid without realizing that it's poison.\n\n- I imagine the main beneficiaries of the LEX shutdown, other than Suburban, will be Megabus and Slamtrak.
