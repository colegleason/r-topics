You will need to take an additional 4 years of school. Most, if not all, A+D majors have core classes that cannot be accelerated, as they are offered per semester and sequentially. So, once you are in A+D, you will have 4 more years, and since you couldn't get in until Fall of your Junior year, that would bring you to 6 years total. Make sure that you can afford to stay in school that long, and that mentally you can handle staying here that long without burning out.\nThe only exception to the 4 years is if you have taken proper analogous courses at a good school that can have their credits transferred. It doesn't matter how great you are at any subject, you will need to take those classes.\nBesides the portfolio, you may need to write an essay whose prompt you'll receive. You will very likely not need an interview right away.\nFirst year, you will do \"foundations.\" This is a year of intensive studio work focusing on hand drawing and also design, as well as lectures on art. Overall, this year is to broaden your artistic horizons and prepare you. Then, there is a very stressful process of applying to several majors. Yes, when you get into A+D, you will not have a major. You need to apply to one at the end of the year, using an updated portfolio, followed by an interview if they like it, followed by selection. Know that it is completely possible to not get into the major you want. So, if you only want one, and there aren't several you could be happy with, make sure you are very prepared and have a strong portfolio. I have seen several people get into nothing they want and end up dropping out, or burning a year and re-applying the next year. Graphic Design in particular is the hardest major to get into, and accepts few people. (To give you numbers, out of the 100 or so that get interviewed, 30 or so will get in.)\nAs for the Foundation year studios, you will be drawing. 3 hours straight, 2 days a week. Be sure that you can handle this sort of thing. It's okay if you can't draw well, but you need to be willing to draw that much, and that long. You might have to do things like draw the same chair, in charcoal, for 3 hours.\nBe aware of the financial costs, also. For graphic design, especially, you must have a Mac laptop. It doesn't have to be new, but it must be both a Mac and a laptop. I am not saying it needs to be that because they are better or anything, but you literally will not be allowed into class without a Mac brand laptop. I am 100% serious. If you don't have one, they're pretty expensive, ~1100 new.\nIf you have other questions, feel free to ask me.

Graphic Design in particular is the hardest major to get into, and accepts few people. (To give you numbers, out of the 100 or so that get interviewed, 30 or so will get in.)\nAs for the Foundation year studios, you will be drawing. 3 hours straight, 2 days a week. Be sure that you can handle this sort of thing. It&amp;#39;s okay if you can&amp;#39;t draw well, but you need to be willing to draw that much, and that long. You might have to do things like draw the same chair, in charcoal, for 3 hours.\nBe aware of the financial costs, also. For graphic design, especially, you must have a Mac laptop. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be new, but it must be both a Mac and a laptop. I am not saying it needs to be that because they are better or anything, but you literally will not be allowed into class without a Mac brand laptop. I am 100% serious. If you don&amp;#39;t have one, they&amp;#39;re pretty expensive, ~1100 new.\nIf you have other questions, feel free to ask me. Think hard before you make that choice, but it can be a good one!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c7mqxzq", "flair_text": null, "created": 1356611236.0, "created_utc": 1356607636.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_15hsum", "children": [], "author": "No_Mojo", "id": "c7mk6zz", "parent_id": "t3_15hsum", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 4, "body": "I'm not in graphic design (I'm in ENG), but I can guess a few things you'll have to do:\n\n**Check the requirements to graduate from graphic design** to start taking graphic design classes (and other requirements needed for the degree) this semester (**EDIT: If you're accepted or approved**).

The meeting itself is useless, but what you have to do is talk to your deans often, especially if start out having more trouble next semester. Here's why: at the end of a semester that you're on probation, is that the eng deans will meet in a room and review every single person that was on probation. If you either a) have less than a 2.0 or b) got higher than a 2.0 and took a bunch of classes that don't count towards and requirement to graduate (like bowling), the deans look at what resources did you use to help yourself improve. Did you go to them for advising? Did you go to academic resources such as the counseling center or DRES? Did you get tutoring? Did you go to office hours? If you didn't, they won't have a record of it. And if they don't have any evidence that you tried to get better, the only logical conclusion they can make is that you didn't. And if they make that conclusion, then they remove you from the university. \n\nIf that happens, you must be out of the uni for at least 1 year. You can re-apply after that, as long as you have proof that what ever caused you to have poor performance has improved. This is better than the alternative - never kicking you out and letting your GPA slip into oblivion so that your GPA will never be a 2.0 no matter how hard you work, which is the requirement to get a degree from the U of I. \n\nIf yo are not removed, you're on super-secret probation. But you have another chance to fix things, so take advantage of it. If you get a 2.0 in this, you go back to regular standing.\n\nIf you need to take a semester off, then do so. Leaving voluntarily and coming back later is better than being kicked out. It also costs less.\n\nAnd most importantly, tell your parents. As an adult, you're now fully in charge of taking care of your education, but parents want to help kids with their struggles. Its more about the emotional aspect, because like I said, you're in adult in college - there really isn't much they can do anyway other than provide support for you.
