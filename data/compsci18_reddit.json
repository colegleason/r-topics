I'm having trouble finding what I want because I'm not sure of the right terminology.\n\nI'm not concerned with worst-case complexity. I want ease of implementation. I can do a naive method of starting from some node, traversing the edges and checking whether I find a path of length k through all nodes (I believe this is equivalent to what I'm looking for). I'm hoping there is a quicker, more clever method someone can point me to.\n\nThis is not homework - although I'm not sure how I would verify that.

Hi, Tyler!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I was recently invited to attend a \"lifeboat\" debate where several faculty members are invited to debate that they (i.e., someone from their discipline) should receive the last spot on a lifeboat after a nuclear war. I have a PhD in CS, and I'll be up against PhD's in Political Science, Psychology, and Business. I'll have 5 minutes to present my case and a 5 minute rebuttal period. I'll also have to deal with a \"Devil's Advocate\" from Chemistry who will try and convince the audience that they shouldn't take any of four profs and just leave the seat empty.\n\nMy question to you, compsci, is what types of arguments should I be presenting, and what types of arguments should I be looking out for? My current plan:\n\n- argue that we should have a source of power, so bringing a computer is not a bad idea\n- argue that we should be out of the range of EMP, so the computer will still work\n- argue that everything depends on computers, so a CS prof will be useful in helping out everyone in the group when things begin to get back to normal (i.e., get computer systems working for factories, get communications systems back working, etc). \n- I've downloaded a copy of Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, Ubuntu/Gentoo/Debian/Chrome OS \n\nI expect that I'll take some flak about CS people just playing video games, and that computers won't work, etc, etc. Just thought that I would throw out the idea here and see what ideas others in r/compsci would have.

If you set up a system where you need peer buy-in on your idea to be considered true, it will be exploited.  The only legitimate way to judge the truth of something is through examining its evidence and reasoning.  Unfortunately, that is not always possible for mundane practical reasons.  So we have to come up with other ways of handling the practicalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got the solution already.  Conferences are among the worst possible approaches, given that they import a whole host of ridiculous human flaws.  Not good at dealing with other people or speaking in public?  Congrats, your idea might end up not being taken seriously regardless of its truth.  Really charismatic and know how to work a room?  Your idea might get buy-in based on your personality alone - and be utterly wrong.  These are flaws that it could have been argued we had to put up with in the past in order to overcome practical limitations.  But today, that&amp;#39;s really not the case.  We could design an anonymous peer review process without much difficulty.  Anyone could submit a paper, anyone could review it.  Reviews themselves, which would consist of a list of specific logical flaws in the reasoning or evidence presented, could be correllated statistically to evaluate the performance of reviewers and be able to accurately judge consensus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many diploma mills cranking out PhDs for no more reason than there is a market demand for them.  There are many journals cranking out publications for no more reason than there is demand for them.  There is no reason this has to be the case.  There are just too many people holding on to old models of evaluation and vouching because it used to be difficult to actually evaluate someones performance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c3yzwff", "flair_text": null, "created": 1331237907.0, "created_utc": 1331234307.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_qmf46", "children": [], "author": "albatross5000", "id": "c3yrjc6", "parent_id": "t3_qmf46", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "does [omg](http://www.omg.org/) really co-sponser the conference?

I tend to look at it as a useful library of tools for figuring out what the &amp;quot;right definitions&amp;quot; to look at in a given context are, and abstractions which are well-developed and can be transplanted nicely into various new contexts which might arise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is rather long for a Reddit comment already. Hopefully it provides some useful examples. No matter what mathematics you can learn in an undergraduate course will probably be useful somewhere in computer science.
