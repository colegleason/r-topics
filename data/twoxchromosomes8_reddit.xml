I was on the pill for 6 months and I had the depo shot before that, so it's been a while since I've had to deal with cramps. I stopped the pill because it was messing with my sex drive, and my boyfriend and I don't have sex very often anyway, so we just bought some condoms. 

But now I have god awful cramps. Yesterday I ate a huge box of double chocolate cookies, and today I'm bleeding and cramping and I feel like crap. Bleeeegggghhh. Tomorrow I'll call the doctor and find some new birth control.

If you read this, thanks. I just needed to complain. How do you ladies deal with awful cramps? Right now I'm eating jellybeans and sitting with my laptop on my abdomen because the heat makes it better. Any other tips? Anyone else suffering?    I feel your pain. I can't take hormonal BC. Definitely a hot pack, some light yoga, maybe some acupressure or acupuncture and LOTS of water/tea. 

Feel better soon!    When I came off the pill it made my nipples sore for an entire week! Your cramps are always at their worst right after you come off bc since your hormones are trying to regulate themselves back to normal. 

Orgasm will help your muscles relax and make the cramps less intense. Short of that, a hot bath or heating pad is best. Good luck finding a pill that works for you! I got Paragard at the exact same time that I went off HBC. ...I'm gonna die, aren't I?

SORRY! typo in title.. should be *OFF*


Throwaway for various reasons. Prepare for wall of text (and probably a little rant).


I have no idea where to begin... I'm not very good at telling my mind and especially NOT in english (not my 1st language) but I'm going to try my best.

My boyfriend (21) and I (20F) have known each other since we were 4-5 years old. Been a couple for almost a year now and I love him so much...He's my best friend in the world and somewhere deep inside I *know* that he is the guy that I want to marry, get a dog with, kids... I want to make a family with him! He's the sunshine in my life and every day with him makes me just happier and happier.

Today, we got to know that he has a tumor in his brain. He has more researches to go but still. It's a tumor. If it's benign it's alright, but it will prevent him from having kids... And he might get some lung problems that could kill him.
If it's malignant...well... he might die. Because...you know..it's a malignant tumor....? When we know which kind it is decisions will be made about treatment and such.

He is very stubborn and I know that he wouldn't admit that he's terrified (which I know he is). He acts like this isn't a big deal for him and it's probably just a tiny little harmless tumor that won't affect our lives too much. I worry about all kinds of things (I have anxiety disorder) and for the past hours I have been imagining the worst things... I am so terrified. But I can't show him because I know I need to be strong, for him. He has been through many bad things for the past years and is vulnerable, and I want to be there for him without breaking apart.

I talked to my mom earlier tonight and told her about this. We cried together. Our lives have been in a downhill for a rather long time and sometimes I think I can't handle it anymore.

Few weeks ago my dad got diagnosed with a very bad case of depression, he doesn't get out of bed and hardly speaks to us and refuses to eat... He has been getting help and has been getting a little better (some days are bad, few are good) and the whole household has been a little...dull. 
My granddad (on my mothers' side) is dying. My mother and him are very close and this takes a lot on her...

And now this! On top of everything! I have to stay strong (and I'm going to!). I have to support my dad and let him know every day that I love him and care for him and pretend like he isn't sick and smile to him and offer him to come down for dinner! I have two younger siblings that don't understand, they just think that our dad is sick, with the flu or something like that. My mom works a lot and she's very tired when she gets home in the evening so I do my best to help my siblings with homework and take them to bed. Then I try to talk a little with my mom and do my own homework...

I think all this is just so unfair! My dad is the best man in the world and I never could have imagined him so sick like he is now... My granddad was always a superhero in my eyes but he is in his 90s so it's very *understandable* that he isn't very well...But still!!
And now my boyfriend... I've never in my life loved anyone as much as I love him. I couldn't even imagine that love could be so strong! 

Today I've spent crying, shaking and angry. Angry at the world for being so unfair and cruel. 

I haven't told anyone about this except for my mom. I'm so afraid of losing them all... 



My world is falling apart but I am going to stand still and let the waves brake on me. I won't let anything break me.

But inside, I'm shaking with fear and anger.  I know how it is. January through June 2011 was shitty for me, with my best friend dying (January 15th), one grandmother being hospitalised for the umpteenth time, then dying 4 months later (June... somethingth. I don't remember what the date was, horrid as that sounds), my other grandmother having a heart attack and having to put my grandpa in a nursing home because she wasn't capable of being his full-time carer any more.

My new best friend has cervical cancer. Take 3. And for her, it's not a big deal. It is what it is, and she's of the philosophy that life throws her nothing she can't handle. Your bf may be the same - "it is what it is and I have to deal with it no matter what".

&amp;gt;I have to support my dad and let him know every day that I love him and care for him and pretend like he isn't sick and smile to him and offer him to come down for dinner!

This is fantastic. Hard as it is, keep it up. If you're not already (you probably are), remind him that you love him often.

&amp;gt;Today I've spent crying, shaking and angry. Angry at the world for being so unfair and cruel. 

Hopefully it's helped you to let it out a bit. Don't be afraid of doing what you need to in order to keep yourself in one piece. You can't help others if you yourself are overwhelmed, but don't worry about being overwhelmed by it occasionally. As long as you deal with it, you'll be fine.  Oh well that sucks.

Yesterday I found out I have a tumor too! (In my neck tho). 
It would suck to have someone be this worried about me.

Maybe he really DOES not care? I know I don't. 
Maybe he's just honest. I don't know.
I feel I'm not being supportive at all here so I'll show myself out.</snippet></document><document><title>"I was a mean girl" - an article written by a woman who used to the mean girl who bullied others throughout school</title><url>http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/02/i_was_a_mean_girl_and_i_didn_t_need_the_internet_to_bully_other_kids.html?wpsrc=upworthy</url><snippet>  &amp;gt; There were peaceful times&#8212;we were, despite everything, close girlfriends.

I'm 23, and my relationship with my mother is a real struggle that is contstantly on my mind and is sending me to some unhealthy places. 

In 2011, my grandmother (my mother's mother) died. My mother and my grandmother were INCREDIBLY close. We all lived together, my mother nursed my grandmother until she died, they did everything together. Since her death, my mother has spiralled into a serious, *serious* deep depression. 

She's so depressed, and it has not gotten any easier. She cries hysterically, constantly, and dwells on the fact that she "can't live without mum!"

To make matters worse, she is an alcoholic. She drinks several bottles of wine every night, gets so blind drunk she can't even walk, and it just makes her even more upset. She gets angry when she's drunk sometimes and is likely to start yelling at me, or ring up someone to yell at. She'll start drinking around 4pm, and is in bed passed out by 6pm. By that time I'm just so relieved that she's asleep and I can get some peace that I just don't say anything. I often have to pick her up off the floor and carry her to bed. 

Meanwhile, she looks to me as the person who need to 'fix' her. She's incredibly emotionally needy. Every morning after spending a night yelling at me for how terrible I am, she'll apologise profusely and say how she'll change etc etc, and how she's just so depressed and trying to cope with her grief. She'll text me contstantly throughout the day and if I don't reply instantly they get more frenzied until they are abusive. 

I have a full time job, a boyfriend and have been going to uni, and she gets mad at me for not being at home with her all the time. She constantly compares me to her and her mother, saying how I don't give a shit about her, how she loved her mother *so* much and I wouldn't know anything about that. 

She'll then come up to me in tears and say "am I a bad mother?" I'm a non-confrontational person, I don't like talking, I don't like discussing 'issues', so I just say 'no.' so it can be over with.

I've told her over and over to stop drinking but she doesn't listen. She tries to hide it from me. 

I've started spending all my time at my boyfriends place, to escape... But now my aunt is ringing me to tell me I should be at home to "be there" for my mother. She obviously doesn't know the full story. 

I'm 23. I want to move out with my boyfriend and start my life. But I'm being held down by looking after this woman who can't even look after herself, I'm not equipped to deal with this. I don't have the skills to take care of a depressed person or an alcoholic. 

Before all of this happened, there was a whole other back story of her being with this horrible, abusive man that I HATED, until he died (she's grieving him too) and I have a lot of resentment carried on from that. She didn't care about myself or my brother when she was with him. 

She doesn't behave like this with my brother by the way. In fact, if she's acting drunk and abusive and can't walk, she'll beg me not to tell my brother because she doesn't want to "worry him". (Me on the other hand?) 

There's so much more I could say, and this is a jumbled mess of a post... I don't know. Thanks.    Your mother needs therapy. Can you take her to a family counselor? She sees a grief councellour. She's on some meds too. 

I'm really suspicious about exactly what she's telling the councellour through, I really doubt she's telling her exactly what's going on. I think she's just saying "I'm very sad and having trouble coping." There's no way she's mentioned the alcohol or the abusive behaviour. 

A little while ago, I came home from work to find that one of my mums friends had called an ambulance because she'd mentioned slitting her wrists, and was blind drunk again. She couldn't walk, could barely talk, but was going on about suicide. When the ambo showed up, she snapped out of it, and was acting all 'happy' and kept saying things like 'gosh i just don't know why they felt they needed to bother you! im fine!' and cracking jokes. we couldn't believe it. she hides it.  </snippet></document><document><title>How do you distinguish between needy and manipulative in your relationships?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vxrf/how_do_you_distinguish_between_needy_and/</url><snippet>I understand that some people need attention more often that others, but when does this need become manipulative? 

For example my boyfriend ignored my texts today because I didn't invite him to a works event after hours. Only 2 hours after I apologised and defended my reasons did he reply and say that everything was ok, then enquire about whether I still have time to see him later on in the week (which since I regularly do I have no idea why he'd question that). 

Is that manipulation or just insecurity? Is it a red flag or am I just looking for them?  It's a fine line.  If they begin trying to guilt you for acting in your own interest rather than theirs, that's when I would watch out.

Just don't ever reward bad behavior. Honestly I'm not entirely sure what constitutes reward and bad behaviour, unless it's in the extreme :/  It's immature, but not manipulative nor needy. I'd kind of say it's all three: he's probably so needy and manipulative because he's young and/or inexperienced with relationships.  He's 27, but acknowledges that he's needy. And he's had the same number of serious relationships as me - around 3-4, since he started dating at 15. 
 I would advise you not to encourage his behaviour. Obviously you'll want to convey the fact that you care for him, but I'd be careful not to overindulge or coddle him. If this is a big problem, he might even look into therapy/a counsellor because ultimately this can become a big problem in a relationship -- it makes someone always the victim and the other always the tyrant. Unchecked it can create all sorts of problems: partner abuse, co-dependent relationships, and just generalized depression and lack of self esteem. 

And this, for what it's worth, is coming from someone who used to suffer from neediness. Help him understand you care, that you're willing to support him, but he needs to address this issue. Good luck     I actually think that was pretty manipulative. Purposefully ignoring your communication in order to make you feel bad/I'm not exactly sure what he was trying to accomplish/whatever is emotionally manipulative. He might not realize it, but it is. Some people don't want to talk when they're upset. It's not manipulative. If my boyfriend and I are fighting, I ignore his texts. It's not about punishing him, it's about not wanting to talk to him. Usually if he apologizes though, I feel better and won't ignore him afterwards. I can understand not wanting to talk to someone, but if that is the case I think sending a quick text saying something like "taking some time to think, call you later" is necessary. Complete silence, especially when I KNOW the person is purposefully ignoring attempts to communicate, is a big red flag to me.   I'd say this was more immature than manipulative. Your apologies should only be given when you're actually sorry... like in this case, I'd go with something like, "I'm sorry your feelings are hurt, but I'm not sorry I didn't invite you. You know my reasons." If he starts guilt tripping you in order to get something he wants that does not benefit you or the both of you, then it's definitely manipulation.

In the end, communication is key-both ways. He needs to let you know why he was upset and why he needs reassurance. You let him know your schedule as it meets common courtesy, not so that he can control it. (Though it was unclear why he was upset, did you not tell him, or tell him and not invite him? I don't want to make assumptions.) 

In another comment you asked what constitutes rewards for bad behavior. In this case I would say a reward is you being overly apologetic and thinking that only you were in wrong and that you need to make it up to him. Then you'd be rewarding his immaturity/insecurity.  By that description, he hasn't crossed to manipulating yet but beware if he starts trying to use that as a guilt trip in the near future.   &amp;gt; For example my boyfriend ignored my texts today because I didn't invite him to a works event after hours. Only 2 hours after I apologised and defended my reasons did he reply and say that everything was ok

How do you know he was ignoring them, versus just away from his phone or hadn't bothered answering yet? He rarely doesn't answer a question, but benefit of the doubt says he was tired and just forgot. But the next day after I apologised for hurting his feelings he was active online on his phone and didn't reply for an hour.  I've done that to people before. Either I'm not ready to answer or I'm busy with something else on my phone and I forget to write a reply. I worry about assuming it is ignoring you.

Your reply to MalinaRana makes me think he honestly wasn't upset nor waiting for a full apology. I have been in your place before in other circumstances and had to be told by my partner that I was over-interpreting the situation. Is it possible you are being more sensitive to this and caring more than he does?     </snippet></document><document><title>How do I brush off unwanted sexual advances from friends?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vtuh/how_do_i_brush_off_unwanted_sexual_advances_from/</url><snippet>I searched reddit a bit and had some trouble finding posts directly relating to my question. And the ones I did find were answered with "Tell them to F-Off!". Which doesn't work well with my situation.

To start off with I just turned 23. I have a past history of sexual abuse and have a bit of mental illness, both naturally and resulting from the abuse.

Most of the unwanted attention is not from friends per se, but friends of friends. Basically men that are apart of my circle. Most of the time I just get compliments that are more normal. My friends tell me i'm pretty, bubbly, fun to be around ect. Things that, well, anyone would like to hear really.

But randomly i'll get some pretty vulgar comments. This past weekend, my best friends, (Male, early 40's), friend from highschool had a few drinks and proceeded to get right in my face and tell me how he would love to "take me out in the parking lot". His face was literally 3-4 inches from mine as he said this and I was leaning back at a incredibly awkward angle to get away. He then backed off and tried to say that he was a "good guy" and "wouldn't do that" even though he'd like to. I tried to shrug him off, told him that I already had someone, and the proceeded to talk to my best friends girlfriend, so that he didn't have an opening to start again.

And on facebook yesterday I had a guy, (again friend of friends), make sexual comments, including ones about bdsm, in reply to me talking about how it was hard to find pants that fit me because of my rump to my gal pals and that I should try to make my own. After brushing him off in the comments he private messaged me with even more! I even explained to him that they were unwanted and that I "didn't appreciate them". But he kept up, insinuating that I liked the attention and was just playing hard to get. Finally after semi-going off on him he apologized but made sure to include, "but i do like me a thick booty", in the same sentence!

I'm so tired of it. It really hits home when I tell a guy off and he keeps going. It brings up bad memories. And i'm so sensitive that I often wonder if i'm being paranoid about the behavior overall or if it's really getting out of hand. But at the same time I don't want to flat out tell them to "Fuck off" because I don't want to cause a scene around my friends and cause drama in our circle.

**TL;DR** Friends of friends are making unwanted sexual advances and comments. How do I get address the situation and get them to stop without making a scene?  &amp;gt;I tried to shrug him off, told him that I already had someone

See, when you say "No thanks, I have a boyfriend", what he hears is "If my boyfriend wasn't in the picture...."  You need to shut them down for you.

&amp;gt;friend from highschool had a few drinks and proceeded to get right in my face and tell me how he would love to "take me out in the parking lot". 

"I really don't appreciate you telling me how you'd like to fuck me in the car park.  Please stop with the inappropriate comments."

"I do not want to discuss my ass with a stranger, and your sexual comments are inappropriate and unwelcome.  Stop or be blocked." Thank you! I have the hardest time getting a backbone about these things without being extremely rude. I think these are just stern enough. Thank you! I have the hardest time getting a backbone about these things without being extremely rude. I think these are just stern enough. &amp;gt; without being extremely rude

I really wouldn't worry about that, the sort of comments you described directed towards you are *not in any way normal* or OK, no matter what a woman's background may be. If any of your male friends were around to hear that, I'm surprised that guy didn't get a punch in the face.  The guy made sure to do it when everyone else was busy.

It's really nice to know i'm not overreacting at this. Since I tend to think i'm just being paranoid and have been taught that this is pretty much 'normal'. 

I've struggled to have a good woman/mother figure in my life for sometime. So thank you for the reassurance. Your best bet is to escalate the situation. Make a bit of a scene. Call the guy out for being a dick, and that way you are both making the public aware of the situation (so that you aren't in danger later) and clearly drawing the line. Most of these guys aren't immune to social pressure (that's why they don't act where others can hear/see them).   &amp;gt;And on facebook yesterday I had a guy, (again friend of friends), make sexual comments, including ones about bdsm, in reply to me talking about how it was hard to find pants that fit me because of my rump to my gal pals and that I should try to make my own.

These assholes are using your unwillingness to make a scene to continue harassing you. They're not misunderstanding you or being socially awkward, they've just got you pegged as the chick who isn't standing up for herself. 

On Facebook it's easy. If you want to give a last chance you say 'Be respectful, or be gone' and then proceed to block them. Or just block. If anybody gives you grief over causing drama (they won't) tell them that you had no wish to discuss your arse with their creepy fuckwit mate.

In person will be harder to start with. There will be a 'scene', but you need to realise that you are not the cause of it, and you don't have to accept any responsibility for it. Be angry that you have been put in the position of having to deal with this importunity and, well, you say you don't want to use the words 'fuck off' but I find they come pretty naturally at this point. The good thing is, once you've done this a very few times the confidence will show in your attitude and you won't have to do it nearly as often as you might think.

  My instinctive reply would be to glare at them and hiss in a low voice: "What the fuck is wrong with you?!"   </snippet></document><document><title>Roommate Problem - not paying rent, basically in the room 24/7</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18x0lo/roommate_problem_not_paying_rent_basically_in_the/</url><snippet>Sorry for the long story but it's really complicated!

My roommate graduated a semester early but she is still living in the dorm room. She never really talked to me about the arrangement and I found out through other people. It's been two months and she is not paying for housing because she has officially moved out (turned in her keys) but still staying in the room. (She can get in because I don't lock the door and it's a 6 person suite style arrangement) My housing costs have not gone up but I think it is unfair since she is always sleeping there no matter what time of day it is. She has had the flu for the past week and a half. Her new boyfriend is also always there as well and there are always used condoms in the trash. I can never talk to her because my other roommates are always around and they are closer friends to her than to me. I let her keep the room with her previous boyfriend in the fall semester because I thought she would be graduating early. I am currently basically living in my boyfriend's apartment, and luckily his roommates seem to be okay with it. I just wish I wasn't locked out of my room all the time! I know I need to talk to her about this but how should I go about it without being a bitch?

Update 2/21: Thanks for the advice everyone. So I've emailed her about the situation because I was still too shy to talk to her in person about it, but probably will talk to her tomorrow. It's hard because we used to be friends but now we're more of distant acquaintances. I think we're going to work on splitting the room more evenly and hopefully I can convince her to at least pay for a fraction of the room cost.     </snippet></document><document><title>Having felt isolated as a lady in tech, I jumped at the chance to get together a community of women in tech in Southern California.

EDIT2: We're also including a smaller group of high school students to encourage them to pursue computing in college and their future careers.  Please let me know if there are any groups of high school women that we should include!

EDIT3: I'm completely blown away by such a positive response!  Thank you so much for you support!! There's a program just like this at my university, UCSD. I work in the engineering department and some of the deans work very closely with Women in Computing programs like this one:) I am just about to contact the UCSD group of students (and hopefully to get the deans involved) to invite them as an official group to the conference!  I was able to talk to them briefly at Grace Hopper, but I don't know them very well.  Would you be able to introduce or connect me?  :) Haha I'll try. I work very closely with Jeanne Ferrante and as far as I know, she's the most involved in the programs like these. We're trying to find out how to reach out to all the students we can, especially in community colleges, state colleges, and places that it's harder to find support as a woman going into computing!

I would appreciate any support so we can reach as many girls as possible :)

(I'm at work &amp;amp; don't have time right now to read all your pages you linked but want to save this for reference. ) We're in Irvine, so about an hour drive from SD!  I don't think it's too bad of a drive; a whole group is coming all the way from UCSB!

EDIT3: I'm completely blown away by such a positive response!  Thank you so much for you support!!  I'm a guy. I work in tech and computing. I cannot stress enough how badly we need women in our field. Many of those women in tech whom I've worked with have been very knowledgeable and professional. Every time I get a chance, I tell a female friend she should consider switching to IT or CS if she's in the market to switch up her major. Tech sector has something like 2% unemployment! Albeit salary and jobs do vary on projects and location, pay is usually pretty good (better than retail, anyway) and you will be pretty much marketable anywhere there is technology and a need to have it supported.

This is a fantastic idea. Unfortunately, I'm at a university on the east coast, and would love to see some initiatives like this come to my region. 

I may suggest that you look into local linux/unix user groups for your area to see if you can reach anyone. It's been my experience that IT/CS department chairs are open to these kinds of things and will disburse your information to their current and graduated students. 

I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor. Where on the East Coast are you? If there were something nearby, I would love to get involved. After we finish this conference I would be happy to provide you all with the documentation and resources we've accumulated! Where on the East Coast are you?

I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor. Thank you for the suggestions! We have contacted the IT/CS chair of every community college, state college, private university, and any school we've come across in SoCal. We may start personally going out to schools to reach out to students :)

We're also hoping our facebook page and outreach will find more students. Another suggestion just by looking at your site. If you already have some sponsors, see if you can stream some of the conference or at least record it to allow others to see what you've done.  Another suggestion just by looking at your site.

I couldn't make it to the conference, but I'd LOVE to have access to videos of talks/panels/etc.  Have you contacted the Anita Borg Institute or posted to the Systers mailing list?

http://anitaborg.org/initiatives/systers/ I haven't yet!  I was informed that it might be a long shot to get them involved, so I was hoping to get a little momentum first!  They host annual conferences for women in computing across the US (and more recently in other parts of the world). The University of Waterloo (Canada) WICS club sends students every year. I was privileged to go two years ago and it was a great experience. I suggest contacting them, even if it is a long shot - they would have plenty of resources.  I haven't yet!  I was informed that it might be a long shot to get them involved, so I was hoping to get a little momentum first!   Male Linux user here. Just here to say that the name of that conference is awesome. Carry on. I'm ashamed to say how long it took us to come up with that name, but we are unreasonably proud of it now.  This is a wonderful idea. Unfortunately I am in the Midwest, but as a woman who just started in the IT field 2 years ago (with math and engineering in undergrad and grad school), I love to see panels and groups for women in technology. If you expand to ohio/know of a sister organization in the area, let me know.

Kind of easy to find. 

I can spread the good word here around silicon beach. Also "girls in tech" is something that I'm ready to bury.   Sounds awesome! I'm going to tell my WICS club about it. We're in AZ, so not too far away. If you can make it we'd be very excited to have you! If you're down, PM me to work out a discount for your group since you'd be coming a long way.    I'm doing a post-bacc (transitioning from humanities to sci/techy stuff) - am I way out of the target group, or could I hypothetically attend?   Female software developer here. Living in the uk sadly so can't help much. Great idea, hope it's a success. Have you tried reaching people on twitter and facebook? Maybe even linkedin?  We are currently just starting to reach out! I would appreciate any suggestions for what groups to reach out to, it seems like there are so many huge women in tech communities that don't know about each other!

We have a humble Facebook page here:
http://www.facebook.com/init.together.conference
but I feel strange asking people to "Like" it even though I know that's probably one of the best ways to spread the word!   The name is just the most brilliant thing ever. 

* In It Together
* In I.T. (Information/Technology) Together
* Init (basic command to a program to initialize) Together

You could possibly also construe it as a play on "knit-together." 

Did I miss any? I'm seriously squee'ing with delight over the name, let alone the premise.    I'm at university on the East Coast, and I know women out here (myself included!) who would be interested. Can people come from elsewhere, or is this mostly for SoCal?

Either way, I think it's a fantastic idea.   Why not make this international (at least eventually, if not now)? My alma mater is Canadian, and I know a tonne of engineers who would love to participate.     As a senior in college with a major in Physics, I've always been really interested in the tech industry. My computer science experience is basic at best, and I wanted to know if I would still be able to attend. I guess what I'm asking is even though my background is different, would I still be able to participate?    If you haven't already, you should hook up with Girl Geek Dinners and see if there's anything you guys can do for each other. :D I posted in their LinkedIn group but I don't know if that will reach anybody!  I think I'm Facebook friends with the creator, but she's based in the UK isn't she? There are ones all over.  I go to the events held in the Bay Area (SF, CA centric.)  Their web site shows the splinter groups too, and those usually have the local organizers emails there to get in touch with them.  If you can't find something local to you, let me know and I'll ping the lady who organizes a lot of the ones here and see if she can't find something for you. :)   Isn't Grace Hopper already filling this niche? http://gracehopper.org/2013/   !!!!!

Sorry for all the exclamation marks, but we've just started doing exactly the same thing in Britain!

Check out the [Stemettes](http://www.stemettes.co.uk) for a bit of background. Sadly it's way past my bedtime over here, so I can't really be lengthy (or coherent!), but expect me to come bouncing at you in a few days, if that's alright! I'd love to share ideas with you :D  I would love to have my two daughters be more involved in tech/computing, be it from writing about it to engineering.

My partner however doesn't seem so inclined.  So I'm faced with a dilemma.

Thing is the little ones love to use the computer (supervised, they are 6 and 4), but they are force fed one single source site (i.e. other educational site are not allowed) and I feel bad that there are more, but somehow they are not 'approved'.

I've set the home network to not allow the bad stuff, so it's puzzling that the known educational sites are still 'not approved'.

The education being mostly logic puzzle games, etc, but early learning stuff, I want them to be able to figure stuff out for themselves, like the if that then, whoa, possibly, hang on a second...  Type stuff.. but without them noticing they are doing that - they have a fascination for science, maths, and really love looking at the moon and the stars.

Ok Edit: non sequiter - was asking myself and being open about my thoughts..  but the point I think I was making is part of the barrier is girls are not expected to BE that way inclined, therefore the opportunity doesn't even arise. 

Anyway, the main question is: why would you put up a barrier to learning computing and tech to your daughters? I would love to have my two daughters be more involved in tech/computing, be it from writing about it to engineering.

Anyway, the main question is: why would you put up a barrier to learning computing and tech to your daughters?   SO awesome! I'm a Linux administrator myself, this sounds really fun, I wish I wasn't in Texas! Have fun gettin' your geek on :)    I'm the only woman in the tech support department at my company, which is kind of small. I would give my eyeteeth to be able to go to this, but I don't think I can get the time off. :( Not even on a Sunday?! Not even on a Sunday?! Also, I'm in Nevada. Oh, well that complicates things.   Have you gotten the local Phi Rho chapters involved? They'd definitely be into this!  This is so awesome, LOVE the title! I'm in the LA area, so this is perfectly located for me.

Other than its location, how does this differ from Grace Hopper?   How do you go about getting into the field if you're just about to graduate (From UCLA, cum laude....in anthropology...with central and eastern Europe minor; had a scholarship opportunity about to expire and had take advantage of it without knowing what I wanted to study...)?

 Why don't you come by and find out? :D

Many women in tech have humanities backgrounds, and it gives them a very interesting perspective of tech culture.  I am personally studying anthropology because it helps me be a more effective HCI researcher!   Female Assistant Editor working in the Entertainment Industry. Can I help?  I'm not going into computer science persay buy I am majoring in rigging and animation which involves Mel/python scripting. Do I count?  Why are there some many "get women in computing" initiatives while "get women into electrical/mechanical engineering" are practically non-existent?  That's a good point. You should try to incite that sort of community outreach in your own field as well. 

We can't do it for every industry. :)  Well, I'm a CS person. It's just that I don't see CS as a particularly attractive field. I certainly have more respect for people who design engines than for people who write databases all day. That's a reason why I find this disconcerning.  why are you a CS person then?  The fact that it's a good choice for me doesn't necessarily imply that, with some probability, it's a good choice for a random person. Vast majority of undergraduate students study CS as a career move to get a good salary. I'm a PhD student, so of course I don't care about a salary (having a PhD in theoretical CS is actually a minus when it comes to job hunting). However, from this perspective, engineering is better and I definitely respect career-oriented engineers more than career-oriented computer scientists.  Oh this guy doesn't respect CS people as much as engineers! SHIT. I guess we should pack up and move onto something he thinks is cooler because we are probably wasting our time here.  Isn't it at least a bit disconcerning coming from a computer scientist? Anyway, look at it that way: how many kids are starting to learn programming at 12 years of age? Quite a few. How many are starting to learn how to design engines? None.  If you have a problem then incite inspiration in the engineering field. We aren't stopping you.  Well, I'm a CS person.

I've read about all of the advantages and I think it will be a worthwhile investment. However, now that I've decided to buy one, I have no idea where to start! I tried to do some of my own research online, but I just have no idea what I'm doing and I'm hoping that on here I'll be able to get some guiding into the right direction. 

Here is some information that I think will help determine which cup I should try:

I'm 16, not a virgin, no children. I've never had any type of pelvic exam, so I don't know anything about whether my cervix sits low or high, or anything like that. I tend to have moderately heavy, but short periods (I use super tampons, fill them every 4 hours or so, and my periods last an average of 3 or 4 days). I don't think my vagina would be considered extremely tight or anything, I've never had any issues or pain with fitting anything in there. Sorry if this is too much information or if I'm grossing anybody out, I'm just trying to provide any information that seems relevant.

I'd like to find something that's not ridiculously expensive ($40 would probably be the most I'd be willing to pay).

If anybody can help me, I'll be extremely grateful. And if there's any further information I should add, let me know. Thanks ladies. :)  I'm thinking of trying them myself, while I'm not sure which are the best, softcup sells a sample pack for only $2.50 that comes with 2 i think. This way you can see if you even like them without spending a whole lot.

Example quote:

"These girls are in a bind, particularly in a situation where their parents are forcing them to do something they don't want to do," Casey said. "Regardless of the [situation], that's her parents and she should expect support from them in this situation, not resentment and anger."

That just gets to the heart of the matter, doesn't it? Whether or not a girl decides to keep the baby, it should be her choice and she should be loved and supported no matter what.  As a pro-choice supporter, I am glad the girl is allowed to make her own choice, despite her parents wishes. 

Sadly though, I know if the girl wanted to abort against her parents wishes, these pro-life people would do all they can to prevent her. 

The difference between anti-abortion people and pro-choice couldn't be more evident than in this case, the anti-abortion want to prevent abortion regardless of circumstance, including a mother's life, rape and incest, yet pro-choice people don't want abortion forced on people, they only want women to have the freedom to choose to abort, or not to abort. Yeah, that's my only problem with this verdict - in TX, no way that the suit would have gone in the woman's favor if she had sued her parents to be allowed to have an abortion. It's a massive double standard.  Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. Well, it's a tough situation, right?

*  She'd qualify for Medicaid based on low income, except her parents' income disqualifies her.

*  She probably isn't covered for *maternity* care on her parents' coverage since dependent minors generally aren't covered for maternity. Could she not be emancipated and fix that?  Being emancipated isn't as easy as it sounds, and it doesn't just happen overnight - it takes months to even go into affect. There are also some pretty strict guidelines that you must fall into for a judge to grant emancipation. You also have to pay court and attorney fees as well, which can run up into the thousands. If you get married, it's a fairly quick fix. If you get married, it's a fairly quick fix. Don't you have to be 18 to be married?

And how much does a hospital bill for giving birth cost? About 10K.    ETA: Actually that was my daughter's bill in 2003.  Its probably gone up at least 50% since then.  And I live in the midwest.

If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. According to the article, they aren't being forced to care for the baby, they're only being ordered to pay for half the daughter's hospital bill when she gives birth. Pregnancy is a medical condition, and as parents to a child under 18 they're responsible for her medical care, regardless of who made the decision to continue the pregnancy. 

I look at it like this: I can't refuse to pay for my kid's ER trip because I told her not to jump out of a tree and she did it anyway. These parents can't refuse to pay for her birth because they didn't want her to go through with it. They can, however, refuse to pay for caring for the child afterward.

These parents can't refuse to pay for her birth because they didn't want her to go through with it. They can, however, refuse to pay for caring for the child afterward. Pregnancy of a child is outside of the typical scope of child rearing costs and can not really be equated to an ER visit. The article also said that their insurance won't cover it.  That's a shit ton of money (even for half) and could possibly financially ruin them.  

Why should they have to pay for her choice? If she wants to be an adult and have a child, she and her child's father should have to take full responsibility and pay for it. I absolutely think it can be equated to an ER visit, which can also financially ruin a parent without insurance coverage. 

And being outside the "typical" scope of child rearing costs is beside the point. What about those parents whose kids choose to drink, or do drugs, or drive a car recklessly and wind up in the hospital? That's also outside the typical scope of child rearing costs, but the parents are still responsible. I agree it sucks they have to be responsible for the dumbass decisions of their teenager but that's part of being a parent. Perhaps, but in this situation, the parents have the insurance, it just doesn't cover child birth because she is a minor. Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. It also appears that the court is ordering the parents to let her use their car and phone because they were trying to take those things away as a way to get her to have an abortion.  I can see why the court would do that, but damn that's creepy.  What if the car breaks down or she crashes it?  Will the court force the parents to buy her another one?  The article didn't say her parents bought the car or phone, only that they took them away. Both the car and the phone may belong to and be paid for by the daughter. I know most people can safely assume otherwise, but I HAVE seen 16 year olds with their own cars and phones they've paid for themselves. Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. Because she is under 18, that is why. You're responsible for your underage kids, that's also the reason we have to pay for broken windows or scratched cars our kids cause. I understand that, but the parents expressed the way they wanted to take responsibility for their child.  If she chooses not to comply with that, she needs to be responsible for herself and her child. She's still their responsibility, but they don't own her and can't force her to have an abortion. This isn't about whether or not she can get a tattoo (and even then I think parents are overstepping their bounds), it's far more of a violation. She's still their responsibility, but they don't own her and can't force her to have an abortion. This isn't about whether or not she can get a tattoo (and even then I think parents are overstepping their bounds), it's far more of a violation. And forcing them to pay tens of thousands of dollars to raise her mistake isn't a violation at all. Out on the street with her. No ... they're her parents, and it's their grandchild. Would you seriously force your daughter to have an abortion or refuse to help raise your own grandchild? Geez. I mean I wouldn't be thrilled if my daughter was pregnant at 16, but if she wanted to keep the baby I'd do my best to make sure that their lives don't suffer because of it. If you'd prefer to watch your own child live in poverty/misery than to support them like you should, then you are just an evil person. No ... they're her parents, and it's their grandchild.

If you'd prefer to watch your own child live in poverty/misery than to support them like you should, then you are just an evil person. And forcing them to pay tens of thousands of dollars to raise her mistake isn't a violation at all. Out on the street with her. And forcing them to pay tens of thousands of dollars to raise her mistake isn't a violation at all. Out on the street with her. I understand that, but the parents expressed the way they wanted to take responsibility for their child.  If she chooses not to comply with that, she needs to be responsible for herself and her child. So, what are your feelings on fathers not wanting to pay child support, because they wanted the mother to have an abortion?  That's a little different.  The parents had no part and no choice in the conception of their daughter's child (while they may have neglected to teach their child safe sex).  The father of a child took an active role in conception by choosing to have unprotected sex. I think if it can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the woman who became pregnant did so by deception (poking holes in the condoms or using a turkey baster kind of thing) the man should have a right to opt out. This would be a huge mistake on his part, as kids *make* life IMO, but it just seems so unfair. A person's body is their domain, so a woman should never be forced to have or not have an abortion. That said, I wouldn't want to be forced to be a mother, so I can empathize with a man who doesn't want to be forced into fatherhood.  If it is just a case of 2 people having unprotected sex and she falls pregnant both people should be responsible for the child. What if a guy wants the surprise child and she doesn't? Again, ownership over one's own body is the base upon which all other freedoms stand. The right of personal ownership has to outweigh the right of a man to be a father.  Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it. Good for her for fighting back, but why should her parents have to foot the bill?  If she wants to have the baby, she needs to figure out how to pay for it.  I feel like I have to apologize on behalf of my state. I saw this story while I was at the gym yesterday and was troubled and confused by the situation and by my own mixed reactions: At first I thought, "Clearly this child isn't ready for a child!" But this young woman is just that--a young woman--and she is capable of making adult decisions. If I call myself pro-choice, then I need to stand behind each and every person's right to choose. I hope that this family can find some healing and peace down the road.

EDIT: Sorry I wasn't clear at first--I feel like I have to apologize because there are so many Texans who think this case should have gone the other way, and that some of the comments from (supposed) Texans in response to the news story are so ugly. But yes, go Texas (this time and most times)! Here's to progress in this great big state. Hope I didn't rustle too many feathers. Why apologize for Texas? The state is the one that's enforcing her right to keep it! Go Texas! Our state rocks! There's just a few people in it that don't make great decisions sometimes.  [Texas doesn't enforce the right for a minor to abort against the wish of her parents.](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf) Why apologize for Texas? The state is the one that's enforcing her right to keep it! Go Texas! Our state rocks! There's just a few people in it that don't make great decisions sometimes.   I'm kinda torn on this.

On one hand, she's fighting for her pregnancy. That's her choice and she has the right to exercise it.

At the same time, I think if you are a minor choosing to do adult things, you should be responsible for all of the consequences.

Then there's the parents. I have ZERO clue what I'd do if my daughter told me she was having a baby. At that age I certainly wouldn't *cheer.* However, I also think the parents trying to force an abortion is wrong. I think their responsibility to her ends at providing transportation to medical appointments. Food and shelter, too. Take a bus to school, and find a job close to home so you can walk.

I'm glad there is an injunction for the duration of her pregnancy. Tell you what though, after all this trouble I'm willing to bet all bets are off after the baby is born. What happens afterward? The parents no longer have to provide a vehicle when the injunction ends at the birth of her child. What sort of home life will she have then? Is she going to sue to have their continued support? 

It's just an ugly situation -- and I can't help but feel that some of this is politically driven.  Her parents should not be required to pay for that child in any way. If she thinks she is old enough to have a child, then she is old enough to pay for it. It seems that the parents *aren't* financially responsible for the child-to-be in any way. They're only financially responsible for their own daughter's hospital visit to deliver the child. Shouldn't be for that either. Isn't it 10,000$ and up to have a kid in the hospital. They shouldn't be burdened with that because she chose to have a kid she isn't prepared for. *They* chose to have a kid knowing that they'd have to pay for that child's medical expenses, including the medical expenses incurred through that child's irresponsible actions. Pregnancy isn't a broken arm. She didn't need to have it. It isn't just another medical bill, it is another living being brought into the world and if she wants it she has to pay for it. And she will pay for the child. But the medical procedure of a minor is still the parent's responsibility.  What makes you think they won't be financially supporting that kid? She's still 16, and if she is having this baby, you can be damn well sure she'll be living at home. A single mother at the age of 16 (assuming she's still in school) isn't going to be able to provide 100% of the expenses of a baby. Her parents **should not** be responsible for that. She chose to have sex. She chose to get pregnant. It's *her* problem now. I agree. 

Idk what your point is. How *could* the parents ensure they're not paying for the grandchild?  I agree. 

Idk what your point is. How *could* the parents ensure they're not paying for the grandchild?  You said "she will pay for the child". I'm saying I highly, *highly* doubt she will. If these parents are the kind who would try to force her into an abortion, they probably won't let her drop out of school, so she won't be able to work enough to make nearly enough to support her child.

They tried to ensure they wouldn't be paying for it. Now, they're stuck with it. That baby should have been given up for adoption at the very least. If a woman cannot be solely responsible for her child, she should not have the child, unless the other people involved are ready and willing to help. In this case, that's not true. And she will pay for the child. But the medical procedure of a minor is still the parent's responsibility.  If she can't pay for her the delivery, how do we know that she will be able to actually support the child?  The reality is, her parents are probably going to have to support the child because no parents are going to kick their daugter and grandkid out on the street.   And she will pay for the child. But the medical procedure of a minor is still the parent's responsibility.  Pregnancy isn't a broken arm. She didn't need to have it. It isn't just another medical bill, it is another living being brought into the world and if she wants it she has to pay for it. Her parents should not be required to pay for that child in any way. If she thinks she is old enough to have a child, then she is old enough to pay for it. Of course they should, she is under 18. Shoulds don't create reality. No. She had sex, she knew a child was possible, she didn't have the abortion, she thinks she is adult enough to have a kid, she is responsible for it. Age has nothing to do with it, she made an adult decision, she deals with the adult consequences. No. She had sex, she knew a child was possible, she didn't have the abortion, she thinks she is adult enough to have a kid, she is responsible for it. Age has nothing to do with it, she made an adult decision, she deals with the adult consequences. You don't stop being responsible for your minor children just because they get pregnant, nor do they own her body. When you have kids, it's implied that your kids might have kids too young. All you can do is try your hardest to make sure they don't make decisions that make this likely to happen.  One more reason I saw the surgeon to never have any. But seriously? I have four words for this girl from her parents. Get. The. Fuck. Out. She wants a damn baby she can go figure out how to pay for herself and her damn baby.

All you can do is try your hardest to make sure they don't make decisions that make this likely to happen.  Yes you do. She wants it she pays for it.  So where, in your laws, does it say that a parent stops being responsible for their kids at the point of pregnancy? Parents are allowed to kick kids out at 16, at least where I grew up. They'd be well within their rights not to support her. Yes, it's nice if they do, but they legally (at least, before she got an injunction) don't have to. 

If she wasn't pregnant, they'd be well within their rights as parents to take away her phone and car for any reason (even if it is a bad one) or just plain disown/emacipate her.  So where, in your laws, does it say that a parent stops being responsible for their kids at the point of pregnancy? It shouldn't be in the law that if a kid wants to play house that their parents should pay for the consequences. She thinks she is an adult, she gets to act like it now. She isn't an adult, that's why they're still responsible for her. It's pretty simple. She isn't deciding to have a baby to "play house". They would be punishing their grandchild, an innocent baby, for the mistake of his/her mother. That's not right. 

I have a son. I do everything I can to make sure he doesn't put himself in that situation later in life, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. If I didn't want to be FULLY and unconditionally responsible for my son (and kids he might have too early) until he's capable of doing so himself, I wouldn't have chosen to have him. Her parents are just as responsible as she is in this. If they didn't want this responsibility, they're also people who shouldn't have had children.  No. They are not responsible for every kid that their kid has, or they'd be paying til they are dead. You pay for your child, not theirs.

No. She had sex, she knew a child was possible, she didn't have the abortion, she thinks she is adult enough to have a kid, she is responsible for it. Age has nothing to do with it, she made an adult decision, she deals with the adult consequences. You would probably be pissed if a pro-lifer was here using that same reasoning *against* having an abortion. Stop being a hypocrite.  I would say that there are multiple ways to take responsibility for your actions in this case. One is to have an abortion, one is to have a baby and give it up for adoption, and one is to have a baby and raise it yourself. That said, insisting that you are entitled to have someone else help you pay for your decision is ridiculous.

As a society, we have a responsibility to poor families of whatever age to ensure that they are fed and housed and clothed, but no individuals have the responsibility to pay for another individual's decisions. I think that she should have the right to make whatever decisions she wants regarding how to take responsibility, but she should do so with the understanding that whatever the consequences of that decision, she has to be prepared to deal with them.

I'm all for organizations that help women pay for abortions and prenatal care, whichever they want, but I'm definitely opposed to forcing her parents to pay for her decision. Her parents should not be required to pay for that child in any way. If she thinks she is old enough to have a child, then she is old enough to pay for it.  My dad dated a lady for eight years before he met and married my mom. He spent a lot of time with that family and has taught us many life lessons from it. Her kid sister was forced to have an abortion by their father at the same age. She went home and killed herself.  I always think of them when I read something like this.

I'm shocked at the lack of compassion in these comments. Can't always have a bleeding heart. I think everyone's relieved at the courts staying that the parent's do not have a right to force her to have an abortion, but are taken aback at the parent's being forced, in return, to pay for her decisions and privileges (car (unless she's fully paying for it, then it's completely hers by right), phone, medical bills). Where does her car come into this?

Parents are typically expected to cover their children's healthcare. What makes giving birth different from other medical procedures?  I went back to the article to find where I read it, but I could have *sworn* it had mentioned that the parents must provide her with a car and phone... I may have read it on another source's article vs the one the OP linked.

Typically expected vs legally forced. Hospital visits for maternity are expensive, and from what I understand insurance company's don't cover maternal costs if the patient is a minor, so the parent's would be paying out of pocket.

She considers herself adult enough to take care of another human life. Her and father should be the only ones expected to pay to take care of her condition and the resulting consequences.

There are sound arguments for and against the ruling here, I don't think it's a black and white issue by any means, but the only foot those in favor of the parents paying have to stand on is "She's a minor, parents have to pay for their children.", as if age really means shit in this situation.

Edit: Ah, it briefly mentions the car here, but that isn't where I read it originally

&amp;gt;As part of the order, the girl will be able to use her car to go to school, work and medical appointments.

Edit 2: Do we no longer have the "My house, my rules" anymore? &amp;gt; She considers herself adult enough to take care of another human life. 

I think this is a big jump. All we know is that she did not want to get an abortion - she could have a number of reasons for that.  True, she could be opting for adoption - wouldn't that take care of the hospital bills, though? That's not really the point - I'm saying people are assuming her reason for not wanting to get an abortion is that she thinks she's an adult/grownup. Women shouldn't be forced into getting abortions they don't want out of economic desperation.   Those comments under the article... *shakes head* *Never scroll down ~~ Never scroll down ~~ Never scroll down* Those comments under the article... *shakes head* No kidding. Those comments under the article... *shakes head* I love using noscript for many other reasons, but one of the perks I've noticed is that comment sections on most sites are disable by default with noscript so I almost never even see them or realize there was a comment section until I see a comment like this on reddit.

Makes for much happier browsing!    You breed 'em, you feed 'em. Well, *I* think you're witty. You breed 'em, you feed 'em. That's easy to say, but this girl probably won't be able to feed her baby, so its probably going to be up to the parents to support them.   You breed 'em, you feed 'em. I don't understand why people are downvoting you.   It's disappointing how many comments here are about how terrible it is her parents are responsible for half her medical costs. I presume the father/his parents are responsible for the other half. 

Sure, they don't get to choose whether she has this baby. But they don't get to choose if their daughter gets into a car accident by her own negligence or recklessness. Can they then legitimately say "oh, those bills aren't ours?" She is in the process of making a decision some might call reckless--but her parents can't rely on that fact to wipe their hands of financial responsibility over her medical costs. 

So sad that some of you would be willing to throw away your daughter over a couple thousand dollars, damn. Parents do and spend so much more for their kids all the time! Also, it is pretty fucked up that she wanted to keep her baby and they were trying to force her to terminate and basically coerce her into getting one through their various actions.

Of course they have the right to kick their daughter out of the home and given the details of the story I wouldn't put it passed them. But I'm glad the judge made it clear they are still liable for costs (which can honestly range a lot e.g. midwife vs OB, home vs. hospital). It's good public policy-- it makes little sense to hold minors accountable, both legally and common sense wise. I can't imagine throwing a family member on the streets or disowning them when they are in a helpless, life-threatening situation. When that baby grows up (without their help) and their daughter makes a good living for herself they will always regret throwing their grandchild and their OWN child out of their life. At least they have some extra money though. They can go on a trip or something.


Sorry, I'm pretty upset with all these comments speaking so accusatory and angry at this poor girl. I myself don't even want children and I would choose an abortion, however I am an empathetic human (which many seem to lack nowadays) and believe everyone should get a choice to live their life as they want.

No, but they can make her *pay* those bills. That's what my parents did when I wrecked my mom's car. I paid them back every cent of those repair costs. *I* made the mistake, *I* paid for it. This girl is going to be depending on them for a long time after this baby is born. Anyone that thinks she will be 100% independent financially after this is just an idiot. And, if I recall, the article didn't say what the family's financial situation was. Maybe the parents are already scraping by and can't *afford* another child. They should have encouraged that girl to do the responsible thing in this situation and put the child up for adoption. Her parents don't want to raise it, she isn't old enough to be a mother (assuming she can't support herself, which I doubt she can at 16), and it would've been better for everyone if the baby went to a good, stable home. Even if they do take care of the baby, those parents will always resent him/her, and that will cause problems later.

After the baby is born, they are going to have to support the baby too, because no parents are going to throw their daughter and grandchild onto the street.  On top of that, they know that having this baby is going to be bad for their daughters life in that it will prevent her from receiving educational opportunities, having a youth, etc...    

&amp;gt; But they don't get to choose if their daughter gets into a car accident by her own negligence or recklessness. 

That's not a good analogy, because once you get into a car accident, it's over, but in a pregnancy there are still decisions you can make.  This isn't about a "couple of thousand dollars."  After the baby is born, they are going to have to support the baby too, because no parents are going to throw their daughter and grandchild onto the street.

That's not a good analogy, because once you get into a car accident, it's over, but in a pregnancy there are still decisions you can make.   I an pro-choice, and that extends far enough to include supporting this young person's decision to carry her baby to term.

That said, I don't think the parents owe her the phone and car and delivery costs.   I got into it with someone on where this is posted on /r/politics. It's strange to talk to someone who thinks that children -- minors -- aren't entitled to the financial support of their parents. Well... I guess I don't really see why parents should have to pay for birth of the child. Maybe I'm mean. She certainly has the right to keep it or not keep it, whatever she chooses. But if she feels she is old enough to have a child, then her parents should not be forced to pay for it.  Well... I guess I don't really see why parents should have to pay for birth of the child.

That's like saying if she's old enough to drive a car or ride a bike then she should be financially responsible if she crashes the car or the bike and breaks her arm. 

She's still a minor and is entitled to coverage under her parents health insurance etc.  Entitled is the word that I take issue with. Parents are not obligated to have their children on their plans I know people who don't because its too expensive. The baby, cannot be covered under most plans anyways and in my mind the moment she decided to keep the baby they were no longer responsible for her.

Regardless, this is not the same thing as driving a car this is bringing another being that this girl will be responsible for into this world. If she's grown up enough to make the decision to fight her parents then its time to grow up completely. &amp;gt;in my mind the moment she decided to keep the baby they were no longer responsible for her.

That's a fairly callous attitude.  Perhaps, but clearly the parents do not want to be responsible for the baby and the girl decided she wanted to keep the baby despite that. I know people who had kids in their teens and were all but disowned.  They made their own way and she will too, but the entitlement aspect just irritates the hell out of me. Her parents should legally owe her nothing at this point. What they choose to do is up to them but a court should not mandate it. Personally, I think this decision since it did go to court should have coincided with emancipation for the girl.

I should add I don't think fines and other penalties teens incure should be the responsibility of parents either. Her parents made the decision when they chose to have a child to be responsible for her and her choices, even the dumb ones. *Just* like your arguments about why she should be responsible for her own child. 

I agree she should be emancipated and I don't know why she didn't go for that. I do think they are terrible parents (if not people) by their actions of coercion, and in that case they got what they deserved. 

The poor kid needs more emotional support then anything else, and the parents are obviously not going to give it to her.

Yes but at what point are you no longer responsible? I would argue that having a child would be one of those points.

I am not arguing this I completely agree.
&amp;gt;The poor kid needs more emotional support then anything else, and the parents are obviously not going to give it to her. 


This I agree with as well. But the result of the case will probably make this even more unlikely when there's a chance they may have come around. Either way its going to be a long hard road for that girl.

 You stop being responsible for your child when they reach the age of majority. Up until that point, they're a child. &amp;gt;in my mind the moment she decided to keep the baby they were no longer responsible for her.

That's a fairly callous attitude.  That's like saying if she's old enough to drive a car or ride a bike then she should be financially responsible if she crashes the car or the bike and breaks her arm. 

She's still a minor and is entitled to coverage under her parents health insurance etc.  Um, if she merely crashed the car she SHOULD be financially responsible for what her parents insurance won't cover. If she broke her arm and her parents refused to let her get it taken care of by a doctor, I could see a problem there... We're not talking about a broken bone. I think that making them financially responsible for half of her child birth is fucking ridiculous. I might be a horrible person for thinking that. But if this "young lady" can make the decision to bring a child into the world, she should be able to take care of it and not expect mommy and daddy to help her out for. Whatever her parents insurance will cover would be awesome and I think that would be a way to go, but the rest that insurance won't? Not her parents responsibility. I have to admit that trying to force an abortion was incredibly shitty and fucked up. But making them responsible for the bills? I don't think so...  At what point do you draw the line though? Yes, the point of labor is to bring a baby into the world, but the mother is also going through an extensive procedure, and that mother happens to be a 16 yr old minor who is still entitled to the protection and financial assistance of her parents. 

If it was just a procedure that was only affecting the baby, sure... make her pay for the whole thing. But it's also affecting her and in that case, the parents are also responsible.

I'm wondering if their yearly deductible is counting into this. If she would be responsible for everything not covered by insurance, she could essentially be paying her parents deductible for the year. Even with her paying half, her parents could definitely end up being the financial winners of this whole situation.  I know it says they are responsible for half... so who is responsible for the other half? Is it her?  That's like saying if she's old enough to drive a car or ride a bike then she should be financially responsible if she crashes the car or the bike and breaks her arm. 

She's still a minor and is entitled to coverage under her parents health insurance etc.  But not really. You don't have a choice to get your broken arm fixed. That's a medical emergency. You DO have a choice on how to deal with having a kid. If you don't want the option your parents WILL pay for, then you should be responsible for the alternative.  But, an abortion is not a reaction to a medical emergency. Being in labor is a medical emergency, abortion would be *prevention* of that medical emergency. Abortion is essentially like what not allowing your child to drive until they are older and more mature would be like. That would prevent the medical emergency of getting injured in a car crash. 

I feel like it would be completely different if she was asking for money to support the child, but she's not. She's getting medical bills paid for. I think that the 1/2 that they're responsible has a very good chance of covering just her portion (not the baby's) of the medical costs. But not really. You don't have a choice to get your broken arm fixed. That's a medical emergency. You DO have a choice on how to deal with having a kid. If you don't want the option your parents WILL pay for, then you should be responsible for the alternative.  Hmm, I guess we will just have to disagree. 

Personally, had I gotten pregnant at 16 and anyone was going to 'force' me to do anything (especially a terrifying surgery) with my body, I'd fight like hell too. If she were younger, maybe even 14, perhaps it would be a different story. 

And I don't think asking her parents to pay for half is a big deal. That is that much more $$ she can spend on her baby later on. In my mind it's a way of the state 'setting her up for success' earlier on.  &amp;gt;I don't think asking her parents to pay for half is a big deal... ...In my mind it's a way of the state 'setting her up for success' earlier on. 

Its not the same, like at all. I'd be happy with the state paying for it. Like... I disagree.

So, you would prefer that this minor (with parents who seem to be financially capable to pay cover her medical expenses) be on state aid? That seems so unnecessary. I would prefer that people avoid that when they can, and this girl can.  It was (I assume) her choice to have sex and she is of the age of consent. You don't get rights without corresponding responsibilities and if we as a society (through our laws) think that she is capable of making the choice to have sex, then she needs to be responsible for the risks and outcomes of that choice.

To go back to the driving comparison, if she was driving a car, of age and with a drivers license and crashed she should be financially responsible for that. If she was merely 14 with no right to be driving, I would blame the parents for failing to control a child, and hold them responsible.  Actually, age of consent is 17 in Texas.  Hmm, I guess we will just have to disagree.

So wait, being pregnant and forcing a baby out of your body isn't terrifying at all? As a currently pregnant lady, I actually find the prospect of abortion a lot more scary.  I got into it with someone on where this is posted on /r/politics. It's strange to talk to someone who thinks that children -- minors -- aren't entitled to the financial support of their parents. Seriously, what the fuck? Does family mean anything anymore? No? My parents would still (financially) support me at any age if it came to it. My sisters would support me if they had the means, and I didn't. There is no question that they would absolutely support me if I was still a minor. And yeah, they would be absolutely pissed if I was pregnant, but I'm still their daughter and that would be their grandbaby. It's a no-brainer. Does personal responsibility mean anything, then? My parents have definite limits, though if I were in serious trouble they would help me out. And by help me out, I mean give me a place to stay and food to eat free of charge as long as I was paying off hospital bills or whatever. But they don't pay most of my medical bills now, they don't pay my tuition, they don't pay for my textbooks, and if I got pregnant and the prenatal care and everything wasn't covered under their insurance (which I'm still on) then they wouldn't pay for that or offer to pay for an abortion either.

We're a close family in that you have emotional support and somewhere to go if you're in trouble, but that doesn't mean that there's just money coming whenever you might go into debt over a decision you've made. All I think that they owe her, as parents of someone who has made an adult decision, is a place to stay and food to eat and emotional support. At 16, I was paying my own speeding tickets, various fees for whatever activities I was in, and so on, because those were the results of my decisions, and I see no problem with them doing the same about this one.

I would see a problem if they weren't letting her live at home and eat for free, and I definitely think it was wrong of them to try to coerce her into an abortion. But I don't think that being family means being obligated to pay for each others' mistakes, especially when the person making the mistake doesn't opt for the cheapest solution and especially when they are making adult decisions that are legally their adult decisions. At 16? No, that's why you're still under the legal care of your parents.

&amp;gt; At 16, I was paying my own speeding tickets, various fees for whatever activities I was in, and so on, because those were the results of my decisions

I'm not sure if that's the norm or not. I certainly didn't experience that, and I know that I'm a lot less "sheltered" than most people, and it's not like I have a rich family or anything.

&amp;gt; especially when the person making the mistake doesn't opt for the cheapest solution

I think people forget sometimes that pregnancy means more to some people than others. I'm entirely pro-choice and would have an abortion in a heartbeat, but there are lots of people who (whether they're pro-choice or not) do feel a lot more connected/responsible/attachment toward their growing fetus. It's not as easy as just going for the cheaper option. Maybe you think that nobody should feel attached to their potential baby unless they 100% have the means to take care of it, but most people aren't in that position.

If you had a 30 year old daughter with a newborn, and she needed $100 to pay the bills for the month, would you just be like "sucks to be you, maybe you should have been a millionaire before you had a baby?" This girl is going to grow up and be responsible for paying for the baby. The parents just need to be somewhat financially responsible for two years (legally). I'm not even saying they shouldn't have her get a job to help or anything, but to toss her into the streets because she wants to keep a baby just seems cruel. At 16? No, that's why you're still under the legal care of your parents.

The decision to keep an unplanned pregnancy or not isn't simply a financial one for everyone.  I agree, and I don't think it ever should be purely financial. There's a lot to consider. But asking someone else to pay for your expensive choice is not responsible. I'm not saying that having an unplanned child isn't responsible; I mean asking someone else to pay for it isn't responsible. To some extent, it would be like if I wanted a dog and someone was willing to give me a shelter dog but I didn't want that dog because it wasn't a purebred. If I want the purebred, then it's up to me to pay for it.

I don't mean that choosing abortion or birth is as simple as choosing a dog, because it's very complex and personal and there's no right or wrong answer. I just mean that asking someone else to pay for it is wrong, because it is your decision. I don't know. I always had cat growing up. I had to feed it and clean up after it, but my parents paid for the food and vet bills. I took responsibility for the animal, but I didn't yet have the ability to fully support it.  Having a cat as a child is not the same as having a baby as a young woman. 

You were only able to have a cat because your parents allowed you to. It was not really your decision, and if they allowed you to make that decision, then that was their decision. They were able to veto that decision but chose not to and they therefor volunteered to pay for your cat to eat and to see the vet. 

This young woman is able (and *should* be able) to have a baby without her parents having a say. But because they don't have a say, they also don't have a responsibility to pay for her decision. I would assume that if they had their way, she never would have had the option of having a baby, but because it's her body, they don't have veto power. And without that right, they don't have the responsibility to pay for the decisions she makes. &amp;gt;Having a cat as a child is not the same as having a baby as a young woman. 

Neither is having a pure bred dog as a child the same as having a baby. But you were the one to start the pet analogies, so I continued the trend. And that's all they are, analogies. 

&amp;gt; But because they don't have a say, they also don't have a responsibility to pay for her decision.

They would have a responsibility to pay for her medical bills if she wound up in the hospital from driving drunk and getting into an accident or from overdosing on drugs. They have an obligation to pay for her prenatal costs. That's how having a kid goes. You have to pay for their incredibly stupid decisions sometimes. If you don't want that responsibility, you shouldn't have kids.  I agree, having a dog is not like having a baby, though I wasn't talking about having one as a child specifically nor was I saying that you shouldn't have a pure bred dog if you want one. All I was saying is that if you have two options and you turn down the cheaper one no matter how good your personal reasons (let's say it's severe dog allergies in our pet scenario so you need a hypoallergenic dog, and of course the personal reasons to not have an abortion are widely varied and in many cases incredibly strong) then you cannot force someone to pay for your decision.

I acknowledged before that it's an imperfect analogy because the gravity and the urgency of the situation are very different. What I was pointing out was why exactly your cat scenario doesn't measure up at all, since the right to make a decision belongs solely to the woman in question and therefor the responsibility, financial and otherwise, also rests on her.

And there's a difference between paying for injuries and conditions that are already unavoidable and paying for an active decision. By the time you can get to your injured drunk driving teen, they've already gotten all of their injuries. They can't make any decision to avoid more injuries right then because the entire crash is over. But a pregnant teen has three options, one of which is much more costly than the other two. Whatever accidents or mistakes got her there, she still has decisions to make. Refusing to pay for any of those is ridiculous, because something has to happen, but letting her know that one decision won't receive your financial support is not neglectful. I don't agree with it, but I don't think any parent should be legally obligated to bear the financial burden of every decision a teen makes, especially when the kid knows what the consequences of their decision will be ahead of time and can factor those into their decision and especially when the kid is old enough to get a legal job and make money themselves.

I got into it with someone on where this is posted on /r/politics. It's strange to talk to someone who thinks that children -- minors -- aren't entitled to the financial support of their parents.  This hits pretty close to home. I got pregnant at 17 and my parents tried relentlessly to force me to get an abortion. My mom even drove me to an abortion clinic, physically assaulted me when I said I couldn't do it, then drove home without me. I'm tearing up right now just reliving everything I went through.

Although my relationship with my parents is okay now, there's still going to be everlasting damage from what happened. I've been able to support my child all on my own so my situation is a little different from the young woman's in the article.

But I am disturbed with the anti-choice sentiment I'm seeing in this thread. This whole attitude with "she knew she could get pregnant, so now she has to deal with the consequences" is what I hear alot from the anti-abortion stance. If people are harping on the parents to kick the daughter out to fend for herself, why advocate for counseling for women with unintended pregnancies? They should just fend for themselves too, right? After all, they were old enough to have sex, so they're old enough to deal with the consequences on their own, right? Why fund planned parenthood? Old enough to have sex, old enough to financially support their own abortion?

Choice means more than just the choice to have an abortion. Young or old, rich or poor. She has every right to make the choice to give birth and to keep her child. That's her *choice*. The problem is that we can't expect her parents to be responsible for the costs associated with her choice.

I think she should have the government support that other poor mothers have. I think that assessing her income based on her own income rather than her parents and giving her foodstamps and welfare if she needs them is reasonable. I think we need more resources for parents in this situations, actually.

But I don't see how hitting her parents with a $5000+ medical bill is fair. Her choice is hers and while it certainly wasn't right at all for her parents (or yours) to try to coerce her into an abortion, that doesn't mean that they should be financially responsible for her decision to do one instead of the other. We wouldn't expect pro-life or personally anti-abortion parents to pay for their daughter's abortion, so why should we expect them to pay for the birth if they don't agree with that decision? Not paying for something is not the same as not allowing it, and I think not paying for the birth is perfectly reasonable. 

I would hope, though, that they get a lot more emotionally supportive in the next few months, because everyone deserves emotional support for their decisions from their family. You just can't expect financial support for every decision. That's just the problem though. Parents are responsible for the costs associated with the choice of their children. Isn't that why so many people these days are foregoing having children?

Kicking her to the streets with a child isn't really giving her much of a choice. Sounds pretty damn coercive to me. So I guess she has to choose between her mental and emotional well being vs. having a home and resources? Well, that's great.

I like how it's a really willy-nilly choice when someone chooses to have a child, but how it's a really logical, rational, and thought out choice when someone chooses to have an abortion. What is *choice* here? Maybe this is the choice she has to make for herself to be okay with her life. Maybe she's really heartbroken and wishes she could just go through with the damn abortion, but she can't? We don't no fuck about this girl. If we're going to penalize women for realizing having an abortion will affect their mental and emotional well being, well, fuck this world then.

&amp;gt;You just can't expect financial support for every decision.

Be careful how you say this. People trying to shut down planned parenthood would tell you the same thing.       Alright, maybe this isn't going to be a popular opinion. But here goes.

I'm so happy that she stood up to her parents and fought for what she believed was right and her right to do what she wanted to do with her own body HOWEVER a baby at sixteen? Well, R.E.K, that's your life gone. That's your money gone. That's your career gone. That's your nights going out, getting drunk and doing silly teenage things gone. It's her body, I understand that, but she had so much ahead of her. Why ruin it?! Because it is her choice whether or not to do it.  Of course it is, but it's not good for her. Your opinion does not change her right to her body. There are some amazing teen moms out there, and some horrific adult parents.  Alright, maybe this isn't going to be a popular opinion. But here goes.

I had been on the pill for about 8 years and started getting terrible migraines. At first I had nothing but good things to say about the shot. I love not having a period, I haven't seen any emotional or weight related side effects, and my sex drive hasn't changed at all. 

However, starting about two months in to my first shot I started getting really bad acne on my back. I've never had an ance problem at all in my life. I might get the occasional small breakout on my face while on my period, but that's it. Now I have a giant patch that doesn't seem to go away regardless of what I use on it. I haven't been to a dermatologist about it yet because it's hard for me to get off work.

I was wondering if anyone else had this happen and eventually had it go away on its own. If not, I had been thinking of switching over to the implant and was wondering if anyone switched methods, how long did it take to clear up?

I go through planned parenthood for birth control because they have later hours than my normal doctor, and I plan on asking them also, but if I could get any first hand stories I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.  &amp;gt;If not, I had been thinking of switching over to the insert

Do you mean the implant? Woops, yes. Editing. No worries :) While I've never been on Depo, my Implanon has resulted in back acne for me :/ I hadn't had acne issues with acne for well over a decade and it started very soon after I got that sucker in my arm.

The unfortunate part about hormones is there's no way to know how you'll react.  Are you still using the implant? Did it eventually clear up, or did you use anything to treat it? Still using it- the benefits (free! no worry with taking a pill late!) greatly outweigh the downsides (breakthrough bleeding, inconsistant periods, back acne. It is a little better (I've had it a little over a year), but it's still there. I haven't used anything to treat it, though I'll be swimming a good amount in the near future, so I'm hoping that'll dry it up.  I can't speak to the acne, but I did switch from Depo to the Implant.  I was on Depo for like 6 years, and my doctors recommended I get off of it because it can hurt your bone density.  I have been using the implant for 2 years now and have no complaints!  Except that it's a little expensive to start up ($120 copay + about $100 for the doctor visit). I have another question you may be able to give some incite on. Did you have a lapse of having periods between the two? I know every body is different, but Im trying to see what to expect. I did not have periods on depo and I don't have them with the implanon, so there was no change there!</snippet></document><document><title>National Review Blogger Calls for Repeal of Women&#8217;s Suffrage</title><url>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/20/national-review-blogger-calls-for-repeal-of-womens-suffrage/</url><snippet>  </snippet></document><document><title>low twenties and low sex drive</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wriu/low_twenties_and_low_sex_drive/</url><snippet>for whatever reason ever since my first pregnancy my libido has plummeted. there are times when it goes up, but for the most part we're  doing good to have sex once a month. being ridiculously tired of this situation, I went to a vitamin type store to buy some enhancers. instead of helping me find the product I desired, he gave me a big long lecture on how I'm too young to be having this problem and need to seek medical help.

Advice?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wdi2/suddenly_very_sexually_active_and_my_lady_parts/</url><snippet>For most of the past 6 years I haven't had sex more than once a month and rarely used condoms. A new partner and I have gone through a 30 count box of assorted condoms in the past 14 days. For the past day or two my vagina (used colloquially) has been.. strange.

It started off as just a very mildly uncomfortable feeling and I thought perhaps too much sex had irritated me so took a day off yesterday. Instead of getting better, it's gotten a little worse. Today it's annoyingly itchy. Not like I just want to sit and scratch it, but more like I want something cool pressed against it very hard to quell the itching. I looked it up online and all I could find were suggestion that I might have a yeast infection. Everything lists discharge and smell, though, and I don't have either.

Everything also says it's very important to determine for sure if it is a yeast infection before treatment. I don't have insurance so can't get to a doctor easily. I've also managed to live 30 years without ever having a yeast infection so I can't draw on previous experience.

I'm considering following some random advice I saw on a forum and sticking some yogurt up there to see if it helps. Has anyone done this? Does it work? Any other ideas for what could be bothering me and how to fix it?

I appreciate any and all advice!  Coconut oil! I have particularly whiny ladybits and coconut oil really helps soothe them. It's antifungal so it helps prevent things from getting funky and make a great lube. Make sure to get extra-virgin and organic since it is your special area. Coconut oil! I have particularly whiny ladybits and coconut oil really helps soothe them. It's antifungal so it helps prevent things from getting funky and make a great lube. Make sure to get extra-virgin and organic since it is your special area. Where can you find this? In the cooking ingredients aisle around the other oil? Most likely, at my local grocery store I look for it in the separate organic area they have. Thank you!  My guess is yeast infection. I've never had smell or discharge, just the need to scoot my cooter across the carpet like a dog. 

Yogurt helps!   also, drink cranberry juice - it helps prevent any UTI's that might form too...   I would go pick up some monistat. It's an over the counter treatment that always fixes me right up! If it's yeast, it'll fix you up really quick and if not, it won't mess you up. Since that's what it most likely is, I would go start treating it before it gets worse. If it still itchy/hot/gross after the treatment then you should probably go to a doctor.

Plus some versions come with a numbing lotion to help you out while the meds kick in. Numbing sounds awesome. I was just hesitant to go for OTC because everything emphasized making sure it's a yeast infection before treating it with one of those things. Thank you!  Sounds just like a yeast infection. I'm from Norway and here we can buy various products without a prescription, both anti fungal (?) creams and probiotic vaginal tabelets. Be also aware that it's very easy to contract a UTI when changing partners and becoming more active (or that is at least my experience). Cranberry juice can prevent UTI.  It could also be that you are allergic to condoms. I have no experience or knowledge about this though.. That was something else I considered. I have used condoms before, just not regularly. I thought perhaps it might be more of a sensitivity than an outright allergy. 

Thanks for the advice on the UTI though I've never had one of those either.

And you can buy over the counter medications here, too. The only reason I was worried about that is because a few different descriptions emphasized that you should verify it's a yeast infection before trying one of those things. I suppose it likely is one and wouldn't hurt anyway..  Yeast infections don't always have a smell or discharge associated with them. Most likely your natural flora down there is off. 

I have never done the yogurt method, but if you do, make sure it is totally plain and has no sugar in it (otherwise, you are feeding the yeast and the infection will get worse). You can get some over the counter yeast infection kits made by vagisil, etc. that work pretty well (I have had bad luck with the 1 day formulas. I would recommend a 3, 5, or 7 day). 

The other thing you could do is take a supplement like this [one](http://www.amazon.com/Rephresh-probiotic-feminine-supplement-capsules/dp/B001J97XE2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361391747&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=profresh+b).  I would definitely make sure it was plain. The thought of putting any food up there is a little weird. I wouldn't want something actually flavored! I was just trying to avoid otc things because of the emphasis everywhere on making sure it was a yeast infection before buying one of those things.

I might try those things if the yogurt doesn't work before going to other otc things, but it's a little expensive. Thank you though! </snippet></document><document><title>My dad attempted suicide tonight...

He has gone on a downward spiral since. He was under the care of many doctors and his therapist wanted him admitted into a hospital (I'm in Canada, they can't just do it here over threats unless it is volunteered which my dad would not). I currently feel I am going on a spiral but I am sedating myself (with prescription medication and prescribed amounts). I will be talking to my therapist tomorrow.

Basically mom mom picked me up from a tattoo shop. When we pulled into the drive I noticed the garage lights were on and there was a lot of moisture on the windows. I knew exactly then what was going on. My mom pulled him out and we got him snoring immediately, however he is now in an incubation room and his vital signs are going nuts. He did wake up and was stable on the way there. He's refusing to see anyone. He also over dosed on some of his anti-anxiety medications. Not a whole lot, but enough to cause odd behaviour. 

I know this part may sound a bit petty, but so much CO2 got into the house (and my neighbours) from the car, that we were all evacuated and they wouldn't let me rescue my animals. I didn't know for a while if they were alive or dead I was going mental over that. Luckily they were all hiding in the one room in the house that had such low levels it couldn't cause harm (taking them all to the vet to be safe). I also got a pill stuck in my throat and started dry heaving and they thought I had CO2 poisoning, that also upset me (biggest fear is throwing up)

I feel so hopeless, helpless, scared, and yes, I can feel the trauma building.

It's actually kind of ridiculous how much I get into it... 

But anyway, I'm not putting this out there because I see it as a problem on 2X, I just wanted to get other people's opinions on this phenomenon. Maybe I'm just reading into things and this isn't a prevailing mindset. I would love it if I'm proven wrong and can chalk this up to my crazy mind :)

Edit: I think I could have worded my title better. It's not so much looked down upon as it is not appreciated as a feminist... I think... gah for someone who works with words I really can't find the right ones sometimes.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies (although less thanks to the people who judged my life off of a few throwaway sentences...). I realized I should have made this a broader question and less focused on my personal feelings, because that's the type of discussion was going for. 
  I'm not sure that this is so much a 'feminist' thing as it is a common attitude about anyone not getting a STEM (or otherwise 'useful' degree). In my experience a lot of people in the STEM fields tend to look down on students in the humanities (funnily, the feeling seems to run both ways...). It seems to me that you might be experiencing only one instance of a global attitude. And no, getting a degree in English doesn't make you any less of a feminist. Seconding this, and actually in my experience feminists tend to be more supportive of non-STEM fields of study, which makes sense because feminism has a long academic history in humanistic fields. On the other hand, if there's a pressure from feminism for women to go into STEM fields in order to break down stereotypes, I might be somewhat insulated from it since my own field in the humanities is so male dominated that being a woman in the field is also seen as stereotype breaking. Out of curiosity, what field are you in? Philosophy, [which has the dubious distinction of having a similar gender ratio as STEM fields](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/phil-by-discipline.pdf) (warning:pdf link) Philosophy, [which has the dubious distinction of having a similar gender ratio as STEM fields](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/phil-by-discipline.pdf) (warning:pdf link) Philosophy, [which has the dubious distinction of having a similar gender ratio as STEM fields](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/phil-by-discipline.pdf) (warning:pdf link) Philosophy, [which has the dubious distinction of having a similar gender ratio as STEM fields](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/phil-by-discipline.pdf) (warning:pdf link) Wow. I'm in the lot second from the bottom! I'm not sure that this is so much a 'feminist' thing as it is a common attitude about anyone not getting a STEM (or otherwise 'useful' degree). In my experience a lot of people in the STEM fields tend to look down on students in the humanities (funnily, the feeling seems to run both ways...). It seems to me that you might be experiencing only one instance of a global attitude. And no, getting a degree in English doesn't make you any less of a feminist.  I think the best part of feminism is giving women the power of choice. We choose our field of study or employment. We can choose humanities, arts, or a STEM field. We can choose to be homemakers. We can choose to keep our last names when we marry - or not. We can choose not to marry. Hell, we can choose to wear pants or dresses. The second we start dictating what a woman should or shouldn't do with her life, feminism has failed. 

With that said, I feel like there's a general push overall away from humanities irrespective of feminism. I think it's absurd. I happen to be in a STEM field and I keep finding that the students I teach are functionally illiterate. They can't write. They can't read critically. I would love for them to have more exposure to language, literature, and composition classes.  It's historically, culturally, and practically important. 

So thank you for doing what you do. You haven't failed. Quite to the contrary, we need you very much.   Humanities fields have been devalued over the past twenty years or so partly as a result of the corporatization of education. Skills associated with these disciplines - critical thinking, writing coherent, concise arguments, understanding the ins and outs of theory and how to apply it to real world situations - are difficult to quantify, which is a problem in a system where everyone wants test scores and statistics in exchange for funding, and profit is seen as the only worthwhile objective in any undertaking.

I think a lot (comparatively, in relation to STEM) of women and racial minorities are in humanities fields because those areas are where issues like racism and sexism actually get addressed and the status quo is regularly challenged. What's interesting is that a lot of these fields (including mine, history) are still dominated by men at the graduate and professional levels and still rife with sexist thought and practice (and even more so for women of color). &amp;gt;critical thinking, writing coherent, concise arguments, understanding the ins and outs of theory and how to apply it to real world situations

All of these things are present in STEM subjects as well, especially if you continue on as a scientist.  I think the problem with the STEM pressure is it so often is dependent on well, having good math and science skills before you enter college. The majority of college drop outs I have met are people who tried to do something STEM related without being good at math or having taken higher level math courses before undergraduate. Or even people who are good at math, but found out they had no passion for engineering and thermodynamics. But on reddit especially, life choices about career goals seem to be as simple as coming to college and flipping a coin at age 18, "enjoy my life and take the risks that come with doing what I love, or go for something stable and certain?"

 I came to terms with doing a super feminine major (journalism) but I kind of did it not just because I wanted to, but because I was good at it. Then I came to law school afterwards, and I like it because I like it. STEM fields are praised because they're seen as a guaranteed road to success, but if you know you're not going to succeed or just be miserable for your entire life, it doesn't really seem worth it. But yeah, I gotta admit I secretly wish I could run into my classes sometimes and be like "yes, I'm one of the few females here, I'm breaking grounds, I'm a feminist hero!" but ideally, one day we'll live in a world with even less grounds to break and very few opportunities to be a feminist hero?

 &amp;gt; but ideally, one day we'll live in a world with even less grounds to break and very few opportunities to be a feminist hero

Well, first off, I think you should definitely run into your classes and become a feminist hero :D. But seriously, I think this is the main reason I see STEM pushed so much. We're trying to get to that equality, but in doing so are sometimes pushing equally important but less "equality promoting" things to the wayside. I guess some of the methods for equality seem hamfisted.

If I had pursued a STEM degree, this would be me. I cried my way through chemistry because no matter how many hours I spent studying and in tutoring, it just wouldn't click in my mind. It became torture to go to class. I see a lot of people going for STEM degrees because they provide stability and they don;t know what they really want to do in life, but more often than not they drop out or switch majors. I think the push should be to do something you enjoy and can succeed in, even if that success is only personal. &amp;gt;I cried my way through chemistry because no matter how many hours I spent studying and in tutoring, it just wouldn't click in my mind. It became torture to go to class.

As a STEM woman who talks to a lot of non-STEM women, they all seem to have these traumatic stories or otherwise simply hated their STEM classes and felt dumb.  "I'm just not good at math!"  I don't want to offend, but when I hear this, in the back of my mind I'm thinking - are you actually bad at math, or have you just internalized the fact that society says women are bad at math?  Are you actually bad at chemistry, or did you just have a shitty tutor and an unempathetic teacher?  Obviously I don't know your situation, and even if I did, none of those things would be YOUR fault anyway.

There have been studies showing that girls - when reminded before a test that girls aren't good at math - will perform worse on tests.  Other studies show that girls lack enough female role models in those STEM areas.  To add to these problems, many STEM fields involve some difficult leaps of insight, where you have to work really hard until it finally clicks.  I think all the encouragement (or pushing) you're feeling is a (possibly misguided) attempt to counteract these unfair pushes in the opposite direction.  But you shouldn't take them personally.  Actually, it would probably be worse for the feminist cause if a bunch of women who weren't "good" at STEM and also had no passion for it tried to join the STEM field.

Edit: getting lots of similar replies, so I figured I'd respond up here.  Yes, I was definitely being overly dramatic when I said ALL non-STEM women - what I really meant was just that I encounter this often.  Obviously there are plenty of women who are good at STEM whatever and just don't want to go that way. &amp;gt;I cried my way through chemistry because no matter how many hours I spent studying and in tutoring, it just wouldn't click in my mind.

Obviously there are plenty of women who are good at STEM whatever and just don't want to go that way. I was always good at math, chemistry, physics, etc. I didn't love it. I kicked ass in AP Calc, but it didn't make me happy. If I could go back and do high school again, I'd take fewer STEM classes, because they made me miserable, despite acing them. I loved my teachers in those STEM classes too, but it wasn't for me.

So when I announced I was going to do a BA, people were floored. People actually told my parents that they should force me into a STEM degree, because I was "good at it." My guidance counsellor told me someone with my marks shouldn't settle for a BA. (She was a terrible counsellor, actually, in many aspects.) 

My parents told people that it was my money and time, and I was going to do what I wanted. I majored in political science and English, and I'm going to start my MLIS in the fall. 

I didn't want to do STEM because, despite being good at it, I had no interest in going any further in it. I'd rather be happy and leave space for those who enjoy the STEM field, rather than miserable in it. &amp;gt; People actually told my parents that they should force me into a STEM degree, because I was "good at it."

That is really weird. Is it so rare to be "good" at a STEM subject that people would force you into it? And even so, why is being good at STEM more worthy than being good at PS/English, which you went on to major in? &amp;gt;I cried my way through chemistry because no matter how many hours I spent studying and in tutoring, it just wouldn't click in my mind. It became torture to go to class.

I sometimes feel like I should have stuck with it, gone to grad school, and worked in research/industry, if only to be a good role model and to "prove" the worth of women to STEM fields. It sometimes feels like I abandoned STEM, and that I'm letting down... someone/feminists.

I don't really have any advice for you. I just wanted to say that I can relate. Thanks :) As is probably evident from my other replies, I put a lot of value in doing what you enjoy, and it sounds like that's what you're doing. I wouldn't worry about "abandoning" STEM, you'll always have that base if you want to return though! &amp;gt;I put a lot of value in doing what you enjoy

and from other post:

&amp;gt;why would I be judged for doing something I enjoy?

That's quite the luxury you have there.  Did you ever think to pop out of your bubble of self-absorption and think why so many men go into lucrative but difficult fields (STEM, finance, surgery, etc).  Because men don't have the luxury of dicking around, doing what they like, working at Starbucks while writing for a literary journal no one's going to read (and in fact, they would be called unambitious bums by a not insignificant number of women).  They need money in order to get prestige, attention, success.  So before you pat yourself on the back for following your whims, expand your thinking a little, and acknowledge that not everyone has the opportunity to do whatever they want. Bitter.

Non-STEM fields aren't comprised of "dicking around." I'm in a humanities PhD program (which, considering the economy and poorly thought out education budget cuts, is extremely competitive) and the first year is already intense. Ok, I am preparing myself for the downvotes because I deserve them for saying this...

I'm a 5th year STEM PhD student.  My social circle overlaps greatly with some humanities departments.

I get up every day at 6:30 and I go to work in my lab for 8-12 hours.  Sometimes weekends too.

The humanities students seem to spend about 15-20 hours a week teaching, then post on facebook about how much reading they should be doing, organize elaborate theme parties, go thrift store shopping, drink too much and spend entire weekends hungover, then in the last week of the semester they pound some red bulls, write a 30-40 page paper and pat themselves on the back for how hard they worked.

I am sure they work they do is difficult and valuable.  But hour for hour, it seems like a great deal less work than a STEM PhD. &amp;gt; I get up every day at 6:30 and I go to work in my lab for 8-12 hours. Sometimes weekends too.

This is basically my schedule, except replace "lab" with "library or office."

Your friends are either not doing *well* in their programs, in really poor programs (I don't know what school you're at), or you're using very selective information about their lives. I lived with one of them so I had pretty first-hand knowledge of it.  It is a top 20 school for my program, top 5 for theirs.  They complain about how my department's average time to degree is 5 years while theirs is 7...I can see a real easy way to fix that but they seem uninterested in actually working most of the time. Bitter.

Non-STEM fields aren't comprised of "dicking around." I'm in a humanities PhD program (which, considering the economy and poorly thought out education budget cuts, is extremely competitive) and the first year is already intense. I have a BA and I'm a woman, so calm down.  Really?  You've never heard of someone graduating with a BA of journalism or history, and then juggling minimum wage jobs because they can't find work in their field?  OK.

And the reason your program is so competitive is because those people who have BA/MAs and can't find work think it's a good idea to go back to school and accumulate even more debt.  Aside from maybe teaching, what exactly are you going to do after you graduate?  Feel about it however you want, but a degree in humanities isn't as useful as a STEM one.  Namely because a STEM graduates' productivity is objectively measured and directly benefits society, whereas only the best of the best are useful in humanities fields, so every student of middling intellect who managed to slog through years of schooling is a waste of money.  And why did you skip my other point?  Are you saying that a man and a woman who each have 100k of student debt and a 30k job in humanities would have the same marriage prospects? More debt? The whole idea about PhD programs is that they give you full funding. No debt for me.

You don't sound like you know much about humanities fields, much less my humanities field. &amp;gt;I put a lot of value in doing what you enjoy

I don't really have any advice for you. I just wanted to say that I can relate.  I had incredibly high science and math grades all throughout school, then decided to do a theatre major.  My family was PISSED (except my mom.  love yoooou) because "You're a smart young woman but you're giving up all of our dreams of you having a safe future so you can prance around stage with all your other girlfriends."  My grandmother, a hardcore, salty feminist who don't need no man, berates me TO THIS DAY (two years after I get my BFA) about succumbing to peer pressure and societal norms.

I think as long as you're doing what you *want* to do, nobody should give a shit about what you *should* do.  I believe feminism should be about having the freedom to choose anything.  Even if your choice is to do something traditionally feminine.  Life is far too short and our individual lives mean far too little to the world for you to suffer in a field you don't enjoy.

Out of complete curiosity...how did everything turn out for you with that major? I just don't know a lot of people who went into the arts so I'm very curious to know how the field goes. Ehhhhhhhhhhhh

I'd like to say that I've become a huge star, but it's not true.  I took time off from real life to teach English in another country and then go backpacking through Europe.  I just got back in September and while I have some really good prospects for a tv show (interview Monday, super stoked!), I'm not doing so well.

My roommates, however, both graduated from the same college with the same goals.  One has started his own little theatre company, their first show is this spring and we have high hopes.  The other is in a band that just toured around a bit.  They're both touring right now with a theatre, though this particular company isn't what they want to be doing forever.

It really depends how much work you put into it.  It's completely possible to go into the arts.  All my friends here are artists, actors, designers, costumers, swordfighters, writers or other things.  Even if that's not what they get paid for, everyone still has time to work on their art.  I might actually be the only one not working on any projects at the moment, and that's only because I'm waiting to see how this interview pans out.  This post makes me think of a quote from [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.](http://www.hpmor.com/)

&amp;gt; "I mean, um... Hannah... trying to become a hero so that a boy will like you isn't very feminist."

&amp;gt;"It's pronounced feminine actually," said Padma.

&amp;gt;"And why're you calling Hannah unfeminine?" said Susan. "There's nothing unfeminine about wanting to impress a boy."

&amp;gt;"Besides," said Parvati, sounding puzzled, "isn't the whole point that we're trying to be heroes even though that isn't feminine?"

&amp;gt;The ensuing discussion would not be remembered by Hermione Granger as one of her most successful forays into the realms of political education. She tried to explain, and then after the resulting argument tried to explain again, while the other seven girls looked at her more and more skeptically. Afterward Daphne declared in the imperious tones of the future Lady Greengrass that if this feminism business meant girls weren't allowed to pursue boys in whichever way they pleased, then feminism could stay in the Muggle lands where it belonged. 

Basically, I think the important idea is not to maximize the number of women in the STEM fields.  The point is to remove biases that make women less likely to enter these fields (or more inclined to enter other fields).

Women in STEM is a metric of how well we are doing in this pursuit, but arbitrarily modifying the metric will just make it a less accurate measurement, it won't actually reduce biases in and of itself.  Metaphorically, this is like saying that telling someone the answers to an IQ test doesn't make that person smarter - you're just changing the results on the metric and not the thing being measured.         People in STEM fields tend to be really smug about their choice. People generally pick their majors based on what they're passionate about or what they picture themselves doing day in and day out. Skill definitely comes into play, but people pick the skills they enjoy. I could have excelled in so many different majors. Biology, computer science, philosophy, psychology, English, anthropology, physics, etc. but I chose what I liked doing. If you're choosing based on money and nothing else, then enjoy making a lot of money for 5 years and then burning out because your career bores you to tears. Or maybe enjoy making money forever, but don't expect me to care. Also I am currently working in tech support, which is not my field, and it makes me want to tear my eyes out, and the eyes and hearts of everyone around me. It is not worth the money that I make, even if they were to double my salary. It's pretty ridiculous to say you could have excelled at any of those subjects...have you taken a quantum class?? what about real analysis or stat mech? Almost 100% of people in STEM majors have to work harder than those in humanities majors...maybe that is why we are smug, haha.  My sister is a journalism major.  I was an astrophysics major.  She works twenty hour days on her feet slaving over her own schoolwork, her own articles and her blog (and other almost necessary tasks to cultivate an attractive resume), and her editorial desk for a student paper read by tens of thousands of people.  She's reported from Cairo during the protests at her own personal risk and wants to go to Jerusalem next.  She works thirty times harder than I did for my degree.  She works herself *sick* and I mean that as literally as possible.  Take your clueless assumptions and stuff 'em up your ass. Thank you for this story. Your sister sounds very impressive and dedicated! Please note that I wrote almost 100%, because I, of course, know people like your sister who put everything into their work. I think I was not very clear with what I meant. I meant that (in my experience) in terms of pure hours spent grappling with coursework (problem sets, studying for exams, lab hours), STEM majors are more demanding. Of course, I am using anecdotal evidence as well, so this is just what I (at a top 5 university) and my friends at other top university have experienced. I have had many friends who switch majors and agree with me that their coursework is much, much lighter. You don't have to agree with my experience, but this is the overwhelming sentiment of my peers and I.  &amp;gt; I think I was not very clear with what I meant. I meant that (in my experience) in terms of pure hours spent grappling with coursework (problem sets, studying for exams, lab hours), STEM majors are more demanding.

I was not a perfect history major, but I got through my undergrad at a top liberal arts college. Just because I wasn't reading or writing, that doesn't mean I wasn't thinking about the things I needed to be thinking about to write papers and construct arguments.

There is a comment much higher up here about the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, although the poster doesn't use those words. Humanities and social sciences, especially the theory side, tend to be more about connecting the knowledge and finding new things in it. We learn how to explore the texts or sources or what-have-you and then are told to go looking until we find something valuable. We are learning a different way of thinking than "X--&amp;gt;Y. Show me how X--&amp;gt;Y." I understand X and Y are really complex things sometimes, but undergraduates especially don't tend to be thinking in new ways so much as being taught scientific rigor.

They are different skill sets. Related, but different. 

&amp;gt; Almost 100% of people in STEM majors have to work harder than those in humanities majors...maybe that is why we are smug, haha. 

And that is just rude and completely inaccurate to say. I am sorry that you are not able to overcome your own incredibly narrow sample bias.
 You are right, that was a rude comment to make, it was a quick one-off before I had to go grade exams. I apologize for it. I can only speak to the experience of my peers and I (in both humanities and STEM fields), and say that this is what I have observed. In my experience it is a very clear distinction in amount of time. My humanities major friends spend around 20 hours in class a week. I spend upwards of 30 because of lab periods. Then there is preparing for lab (prelab, discussion, reading lab manual), there are problem sets, there are lab write-ups, etc. etc. My experience is that in the humanities classes I have taken, you have reading and you have one or two papers per term. In science classes by the end of the term you will have produced between 8 and 15 problem sets, taken 2-4 exams, often many quizzes, 5-8 lab reports, 5-8 pre-labs, and you still have to read/learn all the material. It's just very clear division in the opinions of me and people I know...not to say it applies for all classes at all schools everywhere, just my experience. I'm really sorry to come off as downplaying difficulty of humanities because that was not my intention. It's just frustrating when everyone I know who studies humanities has tons of free time due to the pure fact that they don't have lab classes and all the shit that goes with that but then argues that they spend the same amount of time on their major...  &amp;gt; My experience is that in the humanities classes I have taken, you have reading and you have one or two papers per term. 

That was never my experience after 100-level classes. We were expected to do independent research for papers after we got done with intros. I spent as much time on my baby science classes as I did at baby math or baby history. And to write more like four to six papers per class, plus sometimes do regular weekly responses to reading. Those responses were, I think, a way to train us to get used to explaining our thinking and playing with the texts without deciding to go down every rabbit hole.

I will admit I specifically avoided lab classes, but that was because didn't want my time scheduled like that. I was very (read: over) involved on campus with other things and the idea that I would have to schedule my semester around those giant chunks of time was completely unappealing. My science major friends wouldn't see me spending time on my work because I would be up at night doing it or doing it during their labs. Its a less rigid/formal/quantitative system, yes, but that doesn't change the amount of work. You are right, that was a rude comment to make, it was a quick one-off before I had to go grade exams.

Your assessment of humanities fields does not ring true for history, especially non-US history requiring foreign language proficiency, applying for international research in archives and libraries which often have very little information available online (especially true if you're studying places considered part of the developing world), and sometimes oral history interviews in a recently acquired language. Time management is tough - there's a lot of strategy to learn about reading efficiently, plus mastering multiple sets of scholarly secondary literature (both literature as it applies to your project and the material required for comprehensive exams) and still developing an original, viable project of your own. I haven't even had to start teaching yet and balancing time between regular coursework and "my research" has been tough! (One good part: I lost 15 pounds my first semester of grad school. Silver lining of stress.) It's pretty ridiculous to say you could have excelled at any of those subjects...have you taken a quantum class?? what about real analysis or stat mech? Almost 100% of people in STEM majors have to work harder than those in humanities majors...maybe that is why we are smug, haha.  Lol, you should try reading some intro-level history papers written by STEM undergrads... it's not pretty. Lol, you should try reading some intro-level history papers written by STEM undergrads... it's not pretty. I totally don't doubt that! That is why it is important for universities to have a rigorous core curriculum/gen ed requirements that teach how to analyze and construct arguments. I wasn't trying to say STEM students are great at humanities.  I think you still underestimate how much effort is required in humanities disciplines, especially at the graduate level.

I'm not saying I could outsmart everyone and be the best, I'm just saying I could have gotten degrees in any of those fields because I'm a capable person who has the sufficient skills.

&amp;gt; Almost 100% of people in STEM majors have to work harder than those in humanities majors...maybe that is why we are smug, haha.

Well that's definitely why they think they have the right to be smug. I think that you may want to visit my university, where many, many capable individuals are not able to handle the rigor of their major and switch. I have many friends who are bright, bright students and great people, who still struggle with their chosen field. It is a little offensive to me that you downplay the difficulty of these studies.  &amp;gt; It is a little offensive to me that you downplay the difficulty of these studies.

That's really funny. But I'm not downplaying - I'm not saying the area of study isn't difficult, I'm only saying that if I had decided to major in a STEM field, I have no doubt that I would succeed in receiving a degree in my major. My current major was difficult as well, but I still received a degree in it. Okay, not sure why it's funny, because personally I can't really understand how you are so confident that you can succeed in something you have not tried. I guess you are very self confident, which is a good thing.  It's funny because the problem with STEM majors is that they constantly downplay the difficulty of any major outside of STEM. I'm just astounded by the fact that so many people think STEM fields are nearly untouchable or unmanageable. How would we have so many doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. if STEM fields were *that* inhumanly difficult for 99% of the population? Do you think only geniuses succeed in STEM fields? I think you either overestimate the difficulty of STEM majors, or underestimate the difficulty of other majors. Okay, again, I was not trying to downplay! I am sorry if I came off like that. Also, my observation group is me and my friends at other top 10 universities...I am guessing STEM is harder here than most other places because you are competing with brighter students. But here is something interesting to consider: I just graded chem exams for a few hours, and the average worked out to a 51%. This is very typical of the  this class. Many, many students in this class will drop to a non-science major. It happens every year, and it will keep happening. There are systemic problems in primary+secondary education that cause students to not have the proper background and skills to succeed, that help explain this issue. I am not saying it is inhumanly difficult, I am saying that in my experience it is quite difficult for many many many students. That is all.

EDIT: also I just looked it up, and scientists and engineers comprise 5% of workforce, so not 1%, but not far off. Doctors comprise 0.29%.   &amp;gt; There are systemic problems in primary+secondary education that cause students to not have the proper background and skills to succeed, that help explain this issue.

That's something I can agree with. At least in the U.S., the education system definitely needs a lot of work. Anyway, as I said, I am not trying to downplay STEM majors. They are difficult, and they are essential. I just can't stand the self-importance is rampant in STEM majors, like there's nothing in the world that anyone can attempt that's harder than getting a STEM degree (and that other majors are just a walk in the park and/or worthless). And I don't mean to come off as cocky. You said yourself that it's problems in our current education system that explain the issue - if people were being educated properly and had the appropriate background, would they not do well in STEM fields? Or at least better than failing? &amp;gt; There are systemic problems in primary+secondary education that cause students to not have the proper background and skills to succeed, that help explain this issue.

And, frankly, I wish society would lay off the whole "ZOMG we need more women in STEM!!" thing.

Here's why:

I've never found very many women who *wanted* to be in IT. Of those, even fewer were capable enough to make it. Not trying to be insulting there, but if you don't have the skills, I don't want you. And I absolutely refuse to hire or promote a person on their gender, I only care about skills and fit.

So, OP, as long as you enjoy and are good at what you're doing, I don't think anyone should look down on you. Anyone who does is an idiot.

Oh, and FTR, [this is my sister's website](http://earlgreyediting.com.au/). :) Don't underestimate the value of socialization in telling girls from a young age that they don't belong in STEM fields. This isn't that women lack the skills or the desire, but take a look at recent studies that said that scientists, both male and female, had poorer opinions and offered less salary to female applicants than male applicants, even though the 'applicants' had identical resumes and skills.

Perhaps you have also internalized that same sexism. &amp;gt;Perhaps you have also internalized that same sexism.

How kind of you to assume I'm sexist. /s

I had intended to put something like that in - that we should be teaching our kids they can do whatever they want if they work hard for it. That is how I was brought up. Saying that you have potentially internalized sexism is not assuming you are sexist. Internalized sexism is a product of socialization and it involves certain attitudes and beliefs that sometimes one might not even be aware of. Certain social norms and beliefs out there are just so impressed upon people that they might subconsciously come to believe them (sometimes, as I said, unbeknownst to them).

By saying that you think women seem to lack the skill to be in STEM fields, that to me read as a possibility.

Boys and girls are often on par when it comes to math and science grades up until a certain point, and some studies and observations have begun to examine what is discouraging these girls from going further. And often enough, it's not that they lack skill or the desire to learn, but societal factors and matters of expectations.

*This* is why there are attempts to have "Women in STEM" efforts. Because showing girls that they can, that others have and are living good lives, is empowering and in no way minimizes the work that goes into these fields.

As I said, in studies, both men AND women viewed **identically qualified** 'applicants' in vastly different ways, with the male 'candidate' getting way more positive attention from both male and female scientists.

(http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2012/09/26/sexism-in-science-means-men-more-likely-to-get-hired)
Excerpt: "Despite the fact they were less likely to hire the female candidate, the professors tended to rate her as likeable, suggesting that the reason they were reluctant to hire her had more to do with their bias towards thinking that she was less competent than the man.&#8221;

Now, why do you think that might be?

 Don't underestimate the value of socialization in telling girls from a young age that they don't belong in STEM fields.

Socialization or not, if they don't want to go into that field, they shouldn't.  And nobody wants to hire people that are in a field they don't want to be in.  I'm a woman in STEM - IT, to be more precise.

Oh, and FTR, [this is my sister's website](http://earlgreyediting.com.au/). :) Very few women will self-promote by stating that they are awesome and capable of everything.  By saying "unless you can declare yourself amazing, you are not wanted" you are talking not about skills but about socialization.  Very few men OR women are capable, and want to be in IT.  And yet, the discussion is about the lack of capability of women....

I do agree that people should do what makes them happy.  I just wish that people wouldn't assume that fewer women are capable of being successful at STEM than at other fields. I'm a woman in STEM - IT, to be more precise.

I find it distasteful that you are so quick to assume that the small number of women in your classes and the number that drop out are purely due to "women not wanting to do IT" and "women not being capable of making it". If you don't understand why that's not a reasonable statement, then I don't know what to say. I'm a woman in STEM - IT, to be more precise.

I agree, it should be based on skill, but of course things don't always go like that. Although I'd imagine some women don't want to be in IT because of the stigma society seems to have against women in the field. Thanks for your input!

So is she herself! :D Honestly a lot of it's not because of a "stigma" in the field. It's because the field is so insane a lot of women are like "Fuck this shit, I'd like to actually see my kids once in a while". Just to give an example I work for a consulting company, literally 100% of the women in my office don't have kids and all of the men are married to teachers so that there is someone who can be home after school to deal with the kids. 

Thankfully this mindset is starting to change for both men and women because programmers have realized they are valuable enough to push for stuff like not working 60 hour weeks and flex time.

Sure, we have the occasional deadline that's looming so everyone has to pull together and put in extra hours to get things done. But it's not like that's an every day, every week, or even every month type thing. It's really only happened to me twice and only for a week/two at a time during the ~3 years I've been full time. I hope things have improved for you! &amp;gt;Although I'd imagine some women don't want to be in IT because of the stigma society seems to have against women in the field.

So is she herself! :D What a great point - all women who can't ignore a lifetime of society telling them that their only job is to be pretty and sexy and do acceptable jobs are just WEAK! They should be able to just ignore it when they're 8 and they get told that their brother can stay on the computer because that's a boy thing and they have to come help make dinner. Stupid useless little eight year old girls. In my opinion people who can't completely shrug off all their conditioning and make sure that if they want to work with computers when they're little aren't swayed by EVERY SINGLE PERSON THEY SEE OF HEAR telling them it's hopeless and they'll never be good enough, those people are just weak and useless and who'd want to work with them anyway. Good point sonja. Well done for being brave enough to say something so disgustingly judgemental and mysoginist to follow up on your previous "not that many women are capable of being in IT" nonsense earlier.    &amp;gt;Although I'd imagine some women don't want to be in IT because of the stigma society seems to have against women in the field.

Oh, and FTR, [this is my sister's website](http://earlgreyediting.com.au/). :) We need to not discourage women in STEM.  I hate it when people take this as we need to encourage women into STEM.  I'm near the end of my physics undergrad, and I'm in the process of choosing a grad school.  I came in with several women who felt the pressure to get into it and didn't really have the necessary passion.  They crashed and burned hard.

I'm sick of people thinking that I get things because I'm female.  I've worked my ass off and doing solid undergraduate research, performing well in classes, and TAing a lot.  I got these fellowships on merit, but they're questioned based on my gender.  It fucking sucks.   Your attitude is one of the many reasons why I **HATE** affirmative action.

You've done and are doing well, are doing something you want, and because of AA, people assume you got it just because you're a woman. There will always be that question in people's minds of "did she get it because she's actually earned it, or because of AA?". Affirmative action wouldn't be an issue if not for preexisting sexism and racism in academia and the professional world, though. Personally, I would direct my ire at oppressive attitudes before I would direct it at measures taken to address those attitudes. Except that AA took illegal sexism and racism, flipped them around, and made it legal.

Discriminate against a woman = illegal

Discriminate against a man = "affirmative action"

If you can prove the first, they get their arse handed to them. If you can prove the second, everyone says "So what?". I'm a woman in STEM - IT, to be more precise.

Oh, and FTR, [this is my sister's website](http://earlgreyediting.com.au/). :) I don't think that promotions for young women to pursue majors in STEM is a bad thing at all, nor does it make them feel "forced" into it. As long as they have passion and drive, keeping the resources for them to look into STEM is an absolute crime, as they could be perfectly capable, but just don't know how to go about getting into it. Here's the thing: As a woman, I have no less resources to get into a STEM field than any man.

&amp;gt;just don't know how to go about getting into it.

And that definitely needs addressing.

Hell, I only ended up in IT because my parents had divorced and I'd graduated year 12 (last before you go on to tertiary education). I had no idea what to do with myself. I wanted to continue my language studies, but didn't like the career options.

While perusing the local technical college's options, I thought "hey, I've always enjoyed doing stuff with computers, maybe I should look into doing the Diploma of IT". I went to the information night, but it seemed a bit much. I enrolled in the Certificate 2 instead, figuring I could work up to that level (was totally bored in most of the classes they were so basic), and I did. I just think that there are a lot more pre-graduate opportunities aimed at males than females. Organizations like SWE are starting to do way more outreach programs to young girls in elementary-middle school, and that's the first step to take. Make the information understandable and available to them. &amp;gt;I just think that there are a lot more pre-graduate opportunities aimed at males than females. 

Really? I've never seen them. Can you give me some examples? Just a lot of engineering-prep classes in high-school are pretty heavily male-geared. male-geared how? I just feel like classes like programming and shop and design are very male-geared in general. Boys are almost expected to take them instead of girls  "I just feel" is not a reason.

What is making you "feel" that way? I'm a woman in STEM - IT, to be more precise.

Oh, and FTR, [this is my sister's website](http://earlgreyediting.com.au/). :) First of all, sorry you're getting downvoted.  There are certain opinions that aren't appreciated on TwoX, and yours is one.  

I kind of agree with you.  If you promote people just based on their gender, then you're not going to get qualified people.  If people want more women in STEM, then women are going to want to do it.  Women are clearly smart - so there is no reason to admit underqualified women.  They just need the interest.  How do you get that going?  Who knows?  Why do you think recruiting with gender disparities in mind will lead to unqualified people in those positions? If you give women an advantage just because they are women, yes.  They will be less qualified than the men.  That' simple math.  It's not "simple math" if it's also already assuming that women are less qualified. You're not accounting for the fact that plenty of less qualified men already get positions above qualified women due to de facto preferential treatment for male candidates. &amp;gt; it's also already assuming that women are less qualified.

It's not assuming that women are less qualified.  It's assuming that the women you admit purely to get a gender quotient are less qualified.  There may be 10 women qualified to get into a STEM program that actually want to do STEM, but they may admit 30 women to get a more even gender ratio.  Those other 20 are not qualified.  That's where my "math" comes in.  

&amp;gt;  You're not accounting for the fact that plenty of less qualified men already get positions above qualified women due to de facto preferential treatment for male candidates.

Do you have evidence for that?  As far as I know, colleges are bending over backwards to get more women into STEM programs.  Here's [this](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2012/09/26/sexism-in-science-means-men-more-likely-to-get-hired) link that Curiosities posted above.

&amp;gt; As far as I know, colleges are bending over backwards to get more women into STEM programs.

This is attempted policy - I'm talking about de facto treatment, which said policy aims to correct. Once again, do you have evidence for this assertion?   First of all, sorry you're getting downvoted.  There are certain opinions that aren't appreciated on TwoX, and yours is one.  

I kind of agree with you.  If you promote people just based on their gender, then you're not going to get qualified people.  If people want more women in STEM, then women are going to want to do it.  Women are clearly smart - so there is no reason to admit underqualified women.  They just need the interest.  How do you get that going?  Who knows?     I did not get to stem degree. I make more than most stem graduates and I'm okay with that. When ever degrees come up and my major of choice is made fun of, I bring up my salary and cut that line of conversation off short.  Salary is not the be-all end-all of a fulfilling path in life. If they are generally happy and you are generally happy, then everything seems to have worked out for the most part, no? 

I don't even have a degree (went the trades route instead) and have never felt the need to defend this choice or to explicitly not have conversations about it. It affords a lifestyle I enjoy for minimal effort.  There it is; it makes you happy! No need to defend your perfectly reasonable choice in life with "my car is bigger than yours" arguments if you like your results and they theirs. Or perhaps they are not happy with their path and are taking it out on you through frustration: all the more reason to let the positives speak for themselves instead of getting into petty measuring contests.  Sorry but the reason people are "looking down on you" is not because you are going into a feminine field. It's because you are going into a degree that historically will result in significantly less earnings over a lifetime, you are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed when you leave college and even if you do manage to succeed in your field there is still the fact of that matter that we desperately need more people in the STEM fields right now and there is an absolute glut in the humanities. 

You are probably correct in that this is a prevailing mindset but it's really not one because of gender, it's because at least in terms of what society needs right now it's "less" useful (and I am quantifying this by saying based on economics and what someone will pay an entry level English Major vs what someone will pay an entry level Comp Sci major)
 Well I guess that opens up another question- why would I be judged for doing something I enjoy? 

I'm an absolute mess when I try to do anything STEM related, and although making good money would be nice, I'd much rather do something I like. You're right, there are a lot of people in the humanities, but, and this is purely anecdotal, it seems there are a lot of people heading into STEM fields as well. 

To clarify, this isn't a question just for you, I'm just trying to generate more conversation. Thanks for the reply :) You're being judged for doing something where you can't support yourself or are less likely to support yourself. If you want to do something you like be my guest but don't take out government supported student loans then complain that you can't pay them back in 3 years when you are working at a Starbucks. 

There are a bunch of people going into the STEM fields but its not enough. A ton of the fields that use your major are shrinking (journalism being the big one) where as most of the stem fields are growing by insane degrees. Sorry to say but we just don't really "need" anyone to analyze a piece of literature. However literally every company on earth at this point needs software to compete properly even if it's just a website.   Well, I'd say that human society *does* need people to analyze (and create) literature. But in either case, that's not the only thing people with English and related degrees do. My dad majored in English for undergrad, and he is a professor in a humanities field; he has a job from which he can pretty much never be fired, gets paid to write interesting books and travel the world lecturing, and makes plenty of money. My best friend is a screenwriter, and writes for a video game company. Many of my friends who majored in English are teachers; it's pretty tough to argue that that's not an important job. And then of course, there are even people who cross over into more STEM-related fields with that sort of degree, such as technical writers.

As a note, my personal career path is about as STEM-related as it gets...I am a software engineer about to go back to school to pursue a graduate degree in physics, and plan to continue working in industry. But that kind of path is not for everyone. Some people are not good at math or science, or don't enjoy those subjects-- or they don't enjoy the careers that go along with them. Conversely, I would be a terrible screenwriter and have absolutely zero desire to ever do anything like that, but I'd be pretty sad if everyone else felt that way too, and no more TV shows and movies got made.

There's a place for both types of careers (and people) in our society. But you realize that many of the jobs you listed (humanities professor, screenwriter) include a HUGE failure rate?  I'm sure you're familiar with the phenomenon of humanities PhDs spending up to 10 years finishing their degrees, only to be forced to work part-time as adjuncts and make ends meet with food stamps.  Unfortunately this is not a rare or unlikely situation for humanities PhDs.  I am glad things worked out for your dad and your best friend, but I think it's important for young humanities students to realize those careers are a rare exception, not the rule.

That's true, but so do plenty of STEM jobs. If by "STEM careers" you mean   being a code monkey or doing gruntwork helpdesk-level IT, then sure, anyone who applies themselves to learn the basics will likely get a job and succeed. But how many people want to be paleontologists, or neurosurgeons, or astronauts, and fail? Tons. In a similar vein, there are plenty of humanities-related jobs that are quite realistic for anyone to get, if they put their mind to studying and job hunting. You conveniently ignored the two of those I listed in my previous comment: teaching and technical writing. 

There are coveted, long-shot jobs in every field, but that doesn't mean the whole field is pointless to study. I always see people telling others to not major in English because it's so hard to make it as a professional writer, but I never see anyone telling others to avoid getting their PhD in aerospace engineering because it's hard to be selected as an astronaut. I didn't ignore them, I didn't bring them up because they weren't relevant to my point.  You are right that there are jobs readily available to humanities majors and long-shot jobs that STEM majors are unlikely to get.  But I think if we're offering perspectives to aspiring young students, it does them a disservice to say, "My dad is a humanities professor and it's great!" That's like telling them, "Being a singer is a great profession to go into, just look at Katy Perry!"  The reality is that the vast majority of people who are interested in the humanities are not going to be a professor or a screenwriter, just like the vast majority of singers are not going to be Katy Perry.  So I don't think they're very useful examples to give.

Finally, I would disagree with your statement that:

&amp;gt;I never see anyone telling others to avoid getting their PhD in aerospace engineering because it's hard to be selected as an astronaut.

I don't see why people should sacrifice for a job, or completely abandon something they've wanted to do since childhood just because the current job market skews away from the field.

Like editors! :D Sorry but the reason people are "looking down on you" is not because you are going into a feminine field. It's because you are going into a degree that historically will result in significantly less earnings over a lifetime, you are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed when you leave college and even if you do manage to succeed in your field there is still the fact of that matter that we desperately need more people in the STEM fields right now and there is an absolute glut in the humanities. 

You are probably correct in that this is a prevailing mindset but it's really not one because of gender, it's because at least in terms of what society needs right now it's "less" useful (and I am quantifying this by saying based on economics and what someone will pay an entry level English Major vs what someone will pay an entry level Comp Sci major)
 What society needs is more critical thinking and more awareness of the nuances of domestic and global issues beyond turning profits. The two aren't mutually exclusive though. The thing is, the focus on profit above all else is part of a corporate model of work and education that demands quantifiable representations of results. There is not a quantifiable way to measure skills like critical thinking, coherent analysis and writing, and understanding of culture and politics. 

This is all part of why I find the rise of for-profit educational institutions problematic. People are trying to turn a well-rounded, Socratic education into test scores and data - and it's hurting people as students and as democratic citizens. &amp;gt; There is not a quantifiable way to measure skills like critical thinking, coherent analysis and writing, and understanding of culture and politics.

You're right, there is absolutely no way to get a solid number on those; that does not mean they are seen as having no value by businesses. Each business is likely to value those things differently, and thus will place different amounts of importance on incorporating those aspects into their business model. I suspect that businesses that include aspects such as critical thinking, coherent analysis etc. do better in the long run. As other companies see that, they realize they need to place more emphasis on those, and so they are not neglected.

I would say that there is much less need for a lot of those things then there are people who specialize in them. A company probably doesn't need a person to be a cultural consultant on every product the way they may need a manager to supervise the production of every project.

It is interesting that you mention this as why you are opposed to private schools. I find that public schools as they are now seem to be very focused on just standardized test scores, which leads to students being taught how to take tests over how to face problems in real life (though there is some overlap). I don't think removing education from the government is the answer to that, but I don't really see a difference between what you mention as being bad, and the current reality. Sorry but the reason people are "looking down on you" is not because you are going into a feminine field. It's because you are going into a degree that historically will result in significantly less earnings over a lifetime, you are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed when you leave college and even if you do manage to succeed in your field there is still the fact of that matter that we desperately need more people in the STEM fields right now and there is an absolute glut in the humanities.

 I completely agree and don't understand the downvotes.  This is not a feminist issue; humanities undergrad degrees are often not worth the paper they're printed on.  STEM degrees aren't the only employable ones but they constitute a large majority.

It's great to have a major that makes you feel warm and fulfilled, but those feelings don't pay your rent and you can't retire on them.  Living a spartan lifestyle because you chose to study something you enjoy but isn't lucrative is a perfectly valid life choice, but I think it's equally valid for people to encourage young students to choose something that will put them in a more secure financial position.  And it has nothing to do with feminism. No use in explaining anymore. People obviously don't understand reddit downvoting policy. Ill wave the feminist flag as high as the next lesson but it doesn't change the fact that compared to other degrees, and English degree is near worthless. People are downvoting cause the truth hurts.  Harsh as it may be I think it's silly to get a degree in English. Not because youre a woman but because (at least what I see) it's a dead end. Perhaps the negativity you feel from the Internet isn't because you're a woman, but because it's English. I'm sorry if it seems harsh, it's just a 2nd opinion.

And I know some engineers who make far more than that, right out of college.

I don't necessarily agree with QueenPigeon that an English degree is useless, but if we're going to start comparing salaries, yes, engineers make a lot more. If that's how we want to define usefulness, engineers win. QueenPigeon said an English degree is a "dead end." Making a living is not a dead end, even if you're not making triple figures. &amp;gt; [...the latest salary survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) shows that average salaries for liberal arts majors are on the rise.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/02/06/the-top-paying-liberal-arts-degrees/) I wasn't necessarily talking about money. Regardless, IF you can find a position congratulations.  Then how do you define "dead end?"

It wasn't until about two months ago when my vagina would just stop lubricating, I never got wet anymore. Luckily, lube (KY Yours&amp;amp;Mine) solved that problem but it didn't stop there.

Now, even WITH lube, sex is still painful. The pain is all burn, completely friction oriented. It's as if his dick is made out of rubber, it's shitty. The pain is at the entrance of the vagina.

I really need help ladies, this had taken a toll on me and I would appreciate all of your advice.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I had some bleeding happen after we tried to have sex (with lube) this morning. Nothing rough either, and I ended my period about 3 days ago.  Are you sure it isn't the lube that's causing pain? That lube is filled with sugars and propylene glycol and other icky things. Try a glycerine and paraben free lube and see how that works. Sliquid is an awesome brand. Silicone lube is also less irritating. Seconding Sliquid! Silicone lube is such a pain to clean off afterward, too, and Sliquid won't damage silicone toys (so it's multi-purpose!) Any recommendations for which type? The satin one looks right up my alley!  Are you still getting the same amount of foreplay as you were in the beginning? 

Has your diet changed? I find that if I'm not drinking enough water, the first place its apparent is downstairs. foreplay is the same, and my diet's been the same too.  I guess a new lube is what a need, thanks for the help everyone! Despite all the advice here I still made an appointment with my OBGYN to get everything checked out since I haven't had a pap in about a year. Wish me luck! Please let me know how it goes. I've been having the same problem and it's killing me.     Astroglide is the best lube!

Please?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vt3w/i_think_i_got_raped_second_opinions_please/</url><snippet>Hi girls. I'm not sure what to say. I was drunk, started making out with a friend. Made a rule that no matter what, my pants stay on, because I'm hella drunk. A little while later, my pants are off and I don't remember how, but I know I didnt do it. 

I don't remember a lot of what happened, but I do remember one distinct moment where I got penetrated by something, and it hurt like hell. At the time, I was under the impression that it was fingers, and I told him pretty incoherently that it hurt. I don't know if he stopped, because I can't remember anything after that.  But now I'm starting to think it may not have been fingers...

The next thing I know, he is handing me my clothes, and my god, it was the struggle of the century to put them back on. I could barely sit up, i was so drunk. Which makes me think maybe I passed out? This was 3 nights ago, and I only started putting pieces together yesterday.

I dont know what to do or how to process this. I dont want to tell anyone, because I have no proof. He hasn't talked to me, and I don't know how to go about finding out what really happened. I feel dirty and ashamed and freaked out... I never thought I would be dealing with something like this. 

Please, second opinions, did I get raped? What do I do?  You have nothing to feel dirty or ashamed about, but I get why you're feeling that way. I'm so sorry this happened to you. If you told him not to do this, and he did it anyway (especially while you weren't able to consent), it's rape. If you lost time from being so drunk, you were obviously not able to consent. What he did is inexcusable. 

If that's what you want to do, you could report it, or at least talk to him to find out exactly what happened (I know facing someone after that can be almost impossible, though - no judgement on that). I know Plan B might not be totally effective anymore, but maybe you could ask a pharmacist/doctor about it, just to protect yourself. 

I'm really, really sorry this happened to you. There's nothing you did that caused this. I'm here if you want to chat.  [deleted] That's possible, but I'm skeptical. That's why I think talking with him is a good idea. She made a point to say no right from the start. 

The OP blanked-out on this for 2 straight days. How likely is it that he was this drunk, yet managed to hand her clothes back to her and walk away when she was barely able to get dressed on her own?  &amp;gt;She made a point to say no right from the start.
 
Just like how you can revoke consent at anytime, you can also change your mind (especially when drunk and horny), so that's not necessarily hard evidence of anything.

In the past, I've blacked out entire nights and had the people I was with ask me later why I didn't get drunk. Getting really drunk and blacking out does not necessarily mean you lose control of all functions. Being intoxicated is an automatic no, no matter what they say while they are drunk-that is what I was always taught, if she was drunk and he did anything it is rape, whether or not she said anything different after. He should have better morals. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you have to recognize and accept that there's a gray area. If you're both drunk, did you rape each other? If so, pretty much anyone who's gone to college or is in their 20's (both male and female) have been raped repeatedly.

I just needed to rant here. 

So today I got my period. I have bad periods, but every year or so I get this one which makes me sick. Like, literally dry-heaving, sweating, the chills, all that sick. In fact, I one had a ovarian cyst burst and put me in the hospital because of shark week. Anyway. 

 So, that happened in the middle of school today. I tried to just wade it out, but after an hour and it not letting up, I called in my dad to take me home. I went home, slept, laid in bed, and in a few hours, I feel better. My step mother is getting on my case about "cramps" and my dad keeps giving me this speech about "well I can't take a day off of work every month you know" um, excuse me?

I'm not trying to make an excuse for not going to school, because I know girls who do. But I literally got SICK, and I don't understand why this is so hard to believe, considering my hospital history. 

Anyway, what am I supposed to say to them? They firmly believe I just want attention... And I don't know how to convince them otherwise.   Demand that they take you to a doctor. Hormonal birth control can help manage cramps this bad, and having a professional tell them that this is fairly common might help shut them up. Great advice! My real mom and me talked about BC, and she understands... But my stepmother basically says I should just deal with the cramps and the irregular periods.  your stepmother is a tool. Have your mom take you to the doctor, if you need someone to take you. 

I used to have those kinds of periods too, violent painful vomity ones. The pill changed everything, I had normal non-psycho periods once I started taking the pill. Oh that sounds like heaven. Thank you tittypuncher (I love the username) I also has those kinds of periods-- dry heaving, cold sweats, cramps so bad I couldn't stand up straight, flow so heavy I soaked through 7-8 overnight pads a day. As soon as I went on the pill, I was fine. Girls/women that don't get bad periods can't seem to understand that some girls/women do and they either think you're being dramatic or faking. I don't know how many times I've been told to "suck it up" or "go on a walk" while I was doubled over in pain and passing clots the size of my palm. (TMI? Sorry!) 

Hopefully your real mom will take you to the doctor. If not, chamomile tea helps a bit with cramps.  This is going to sound kind of weird and it's only anecdotal, but changing my diet has seriously helped out with my period.  Since cutting out animal products, my periods have been shorter, lighter, and much less painful, with only mild cramping on the first day as a warning signal.  I was also one with cold sweats, uterus twisting cramps and nausea.  

It's entirely possible that it's completely coincidental that I started noticing this about two months after the change and I'm just connecting the two in my mind, but I've had so many other health benefits too that I'm inclined to believe they're related. No, not weird at all! I totally believe that can help, not only with bad periods, but with many health problems: asthma, acne, allergies, getting a lot of colds. I went vegan about 5 years ago and it actually did help my period a bit! It didn't completely fix my period problems, but made them more bearable. Oh yay!  Yeah, seriously, my skin is damn near flawless now, and after the initial gassy adjustment period, digesting is sooo... comfortable!  Vegan: come for the fuzzy critters, stay for the health benefits!

But I'm also really active, and no matter how much I ate, I wasn't getting enough protein :( It might just be the way your body works, or what you were eating, but there are a LOT of veg*n athletes and bodybuilders that have no problem with their protein intake.  :/    Oh that sounds like heaven.

I used to have those kinds of periods too, violent painful vomity ones. The pill changed everything, I had normal non-psycho periods once I started taking the pill. same. same. same. BC really helped my pain. I like your post. It rhymes! Great advice! My real mom and me talked about BC, and she understands... But my stepmother basically says I should just deal with the cramps and the irregular periods.  My periods try to kill me, too. I dealt with the terrible pain and anemia until I had serious health problems. It was affecting my quality of life. 

Now I'm on birth control and honestly, I don't know how I got through every month before. I shudder to think of a day of classes in middle or high school with what my periods were. I didn't know any better. It angers me to think that my parents and doctors thought that was acceptable, considering how much visible pain I was in and how much school I missed.

I can't believe I lived with that. You shouldn't have to. This is a health issue. It is not something we "deal with" or suck it up any more than one "deals with" diabetes or appendicitis. It needs to be treated. 

Feel better soon.   Our society as a whole has a problem with illness. I have a chronic illness and lost a big part of my family and most of my friends over suspicions I am not trying, wanting attention, getting out of work etc. I am involved in several chronic illness organisations and groups and I am sorry to say that it is a universal problem.

It is most devastating when your parents are suspicious (on the other hand, there is a lot of pressure on parents to be suspicious of their teenager/early adult children :( ). 

I hope they become more understanding, and your periods settle down. Best wishes. Thank you! I have never really had any health issues before and they prided themselves on that, so I can understand where they are coming from... But the feels man.  That's such crap - YOU not getting sick has NOTHING to do with their parenting skills. Their genes, maybe, which they don't even control. Luck, definitely. So they were careful not to take you around super contagious people. That's obvious. 

They're being assholes. I'm sorry. I would come clean with them, be honest about how much pain you're in, but you're glad it passed in an afternoon, but that you are *incredibly hurt* that they *don't trust you* because you love them, respect them, and would not lie to them. Then tell them you need to see a gynecologist to get this sorted out. It's no way to live.  Oh thank you :) that's the greatest advice ever and I definately will do that.  Our society as a whole has a problem with illness. I have a chronic illness and lost a big part of my family and most of my friends over suspicions I am not trying, wanting attention, getting out of work etc. I am involved in several chronic illness organisations and groups and I am sorry to say that it is a universal problem.

It is most devastating when your parents are suspicious (on the other hand, there is a lot of pressure on parents to be suspicious of their teenager/early adult children :( ). 

I hope they become more understanding, and your periods settle down. Best wishes. It's comforting to know this happens to other people, too. I lost a LOT of friends over my chronic illness and it really hurts to think about.  I also get cysts and had one the size of a grapefruit removed last summer. A couple months after the surgery I was given birth control to help with preventing cysts but after doing an ultrasound I saw that I had one about 3 centimeters big. Fast forward 6 months or so and I start having the same symptoms from when I had my surgery. I freak out and make an appointment to see my doctor but I am in pain. The day of my doctors appointment my cyst had popped/burst/leaked and the doctor confirmed this but also said it had to of been a small one (thank god) and that I would be fine. I was sore a couple of days and then I started bleeding. 

Okay sorry for that long post but the point of my story is that through all of this my bf said he thought I was "overreacting" and although he was "supportive" he doubted me the entire way until he saw I was bleeding, even though I had prior evidence of an issue. 

I'm not sure where this doubt stems from with people but people like to live in fairy land and it seems like they just don't want to face reality when it comes to a loved one being sick or being in chronic pain. Its infuriating to me that woman's health and pain isn't considered top priority in our society. 

TLDR; Was in a lot of pain and my bf thought I was overreacting even though it had to deal with something id gone through with my ovaries.

No, but as everyone on this thread says, it sounds like a really good idea.  Good luck! Your dad does sound like a bit of an ass about this. He usually does... For many things  Your story reminded me of my little bros, who are both adults now.  But when they were little, they used to fake having a stomach ache to get out of school and chores (I don't blame them).

Anyways, (and this happened to BOTH of them two years apart) one day they really *did* have a bad stomach ache.  The problem turned out to be appendicitis for both of them!

I hope things work out with your parents.  There's been a lot of good advice in this thread, but I have a question that I don't think anyone has asked: do you have a history of attention-seeking behavior?  Note that I am NOT saying that you're faking this, but maybe if you used to play sick a lot when you were younger they might think you're still doing that?

EDIT: Okay, judging by the downvotes, I feel like people are reading something accusatory into my question.  If it was worded in a way that suggested an accusation, I apologize, as that was not my intention.  I also apologize for the phrase "attention-seeking behavior", as that was probably insensitively worded.  But I simply asked because I know people who used to fake sick to get out of going to school all the time (and I still know people like that).  I was just curious if that was something OP had done at any point in her childhood.  I am also not condoning her parents' seemingly ignoring the fact that she is having a medical issue, I'm just trying to look at it from a slightly different perspective. Nope. I have straight A's, I play 4 sports, in in band and rock class, and I play multiple instruments and sing. I've only missed school because I was sick maybe 3 times, and one of those was for an ear infection and one for strep throat.

Edit: what I'm saying is I'm a perfect kid. I never EVER have faked sick, and if I did I wouldn't have posted this because I would've seen where they were coming from.   I edited my comment, but I wanted to reply to you, as well.  I'm sorry if my question seemed accusatory and/or was poorly phrased, but I was really only curious if faking sick was something you used to do a lot of as a child and that might make them think twice about potential medical issues.  I'm not saying that them ignoring this issue is justified, I was just simply asking a question to try to understand the situation a bit better.

Finally to shut me up they took me to a doctor where I was promptly scheduled for some surgeries. Whoops, maybe it wasn't attention seeking at all! I edited my above comment, but I wanted to ask: what part of my comment indicated that I didn't think she had a medical issue, which is what you seem to be implying?  I was only trying to get a little more context about the OP's situation, and I feel like people think I'm accusing her of something. </snippet></document><document><title>Did you start having boyfriends this young (why does this story make me feel like a fuddy duddy)?</title><url>http://www.yourtango.com/2013171258/my-6-year-old-has-boyfriend-im-ok-with-it?cid=b5</url><snippet>  I work with children (and have been a child :) ) and have seen a lot of cases of "boyfriends/girlfriends" or puppy love.

I think it's good to amass non/fictional literature and media for one's sanity and I intend to surround my future children with a few bullshit ideas of gender roles and sexism as possible. 

So far I have:

Lara Croft (tomb raider, the newest version of lara. Plus there's nothing wrong with being sexy when there's much more depth to the character)

Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games)

Samus Aran (Metroid)

Vanessa (P.N.03)

Firefly female characters

Nariko (Heavenly Sword)

Mulan 

female characters in Harry Pottter books

femshep (Mass Effect)

Sally Lockhart (Phillip Pullman tetralogy)

I will look into all your suggestions, fiction is good but non-fictional characters would be even better :)     Off the top of my head, Castle has three strong women. Kate, Alexis, and Martha. 

And Game of Thrones is crawling with them. Off the top of my head, Castle has three strong women. Kate, Alexis, and Martha. 

And Game of Thrones is crawling with them. Off the top of my head, Castle has three strong women. Kate, Alexis, and Martha. 

And Game of Thrones is crawling with them.  Battlestar Galactica women

Stargate women, especially Col. Carter

the girl characters in most of Miyazaki's films, but especially Spirited Away and Nausicaa Battlestar Galactica women

Stargate women, especially Col. Carter

the girl characters in most of Miyazaki's films, but especially Spirited Away and Nausicaa  Buffy the vampire slayer, I actually look at her as a metaphor for the forms of feminism our generation has inherited? Buffy feels like she needs to save the world, get the guy, and have a career/do well in school but she never gets all three at the same time.

 I also think you should add some male characters who are all about equality like Finn and Jake in Adventure time? Whenever a character says something sexist, either Finn or Jake verbally disapprove and usually explain why it isn't cool.

I also grew up watching law and order SVU but it might just be the episodes I've seen are very anti-rape culture and talk about how it's never the victims fault even if she/he feels that way.  I came here to mention Whedonverse characters (check out the ladies from Firefly too!), but I think you made a good point with Adventure Time as well. While the two main characters are male, nearly all of the regular supporting cast (minus the Ice King and his penguins) is female, and each has their own personality without necessarily playing completely into gender roles. I like it. Right? Whedon always makes me feel like a lady and a person. I wanted to include Dollhouse but I feel like that might be a little grown up plus so far I've really met girls who enjoyed it and most guys said it wasn't well planned enough or they found the plot superficial. 

Also have you seen Princess Cookie? I must have rematched it 40 times by now an I still usually cry. That episode just has such an amazing message and The way they mirror Jakes simple dream with cookies complicated one is just.... Llllaaaaagh you know? 

TL:DR I geeked out...  Fiction:

* most female characters in any Robin McKinley book

* Captain Janeway, Star Trek Voyager (actually most Star Trek women)

* Atalanta, Greek mythology

* Abby/Kate/Ziva, NCIS

* most female characters in any Scott Westerfeld book

Nonfiction:

* Boudicca

* Elizabeth I

* Mary Queen of Scots

* Grace O'Malley (Grania)

There are definitely way more in my home library, but these were the first I thought of :)   I would say there's a few from Downton Abbey, odd as it may seem for the time period. The Dowager Countess sort of runs their shit, Cora Crawley is fo' sho' a strong lady, as is Lady Sybil.. I mean, Sybil pretty much disowned the whole high class life to become a nurse during the war, that was pretty unheard of for someone of their social stature. I think we are seeing Lady Edith become a lot more likable and forward thinking too, now that she and Mary have stopped backstabbing each other all of the time. I do suppose you're right, though I still just plain don't *like* Edith. Lame, I know, but oh well. Though she is showing the strength by keeping on with her writing for the newspaper after her father was specifically like "what, no, none of that now". 

Also I have an old-lady-crush on the Dowager Countess because she's so damn sassy, and she's Dame Maggie. Who DOESN'T love Dame Maggie?  Pick and choose any female character from Avatar: The Last Airbender and Avatar: Legend of Korra. Every female character is written as someone with her own strengths and weaknesses, motivations, and relationships.    Don't forget Ripley from Alien.

I'm not sure if that's quite what you're looking for, as the characters were explicitly written without sex indications, so Ripley could have as easily been male as female. Ripley is my role model. Alien is an excellent movie. I like that the horror in it was minimally shown and maximally implied. And I like that the characters were written unisex. Plus, I love John Hurt.

I have to admit that Aliens is my least favorite in the series, and I like Alien^3 and Alien: Resurrection, even though everybody seems to pan them as not being any good. You didn't like "Aliens"????

Game over, man! Calm your tits, Hudson! :P

I like it, just not as much as I like the others. To be honest, I don't like Newt. Thanks to [South Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKdocYeSqTA) I can't take her seriously. It also seemed less gritty than the others, possibly because the presence of the Marines gives us a large group of fairly capable people to combat the aliens. To me it was too much action and not enough psychology....although admittedly Burke is a creep, I felt like the horror aspect was played down compared to Alien, and the setting was less of an interesting part of the story compared to Alien^3. I think Aliens also drew away from the ideas of sex and power as portrayed in Alien and somewhat in Alien^3 (that is, Ripley being the only woman in a prison setting).

As for Resurrection, well, mostly I love the mercenaries (Call excepted, preachy thing that she is...). I love Michael Wincott, Ron Perlman, and Dominique Pinon. Also, I think the creepy factor falls back on the aliens (who have learned to hurt each other by being around humans) and on the scientists (especially the one who like...tries to make out with the aliens), and of course on Ripley's less-than-human portrayal. Plus, the hybrid was fucking creepy. The sex-and-power goes back to being alien and human. I can understand the thing about Newt. I don't know if you've read about any of the deleted scenes from Aliens, but Ripley was supposed to more of a backstory concerning her own daughter that was then supposed to tie into Newt's character more. I don't remember exactly why they cut it though.

Ultimately, however, I've got to agree with you in that Alien and Aliens (and the following movies) are very different films as to the kind of action vs. horror that they present. While I liked all of them, I think Alien really was the best ultimately. Ripley was just such a boss, and I think so much of the tension of the movie comes from watching her try to take control of the situation, saving herself (and Jones the cat!), all while not knowing what she is really capable of. I usually watch the non-theatrical releases (I have the "Quadrilogy" on DVD, so I have seen the scene with her deceased daughter), but part of it is just that I am difficult to please when it comes to kids in horror movies. At least when they're on the good guys' side. Creepy horror movie children I can totally get behind (Children of the Corn types).

I agree, I think Alien was the best. It was stark, and I think that helped to emphasize the fact that they were out in the middle of nowhere on a ship by themselves with no help nearby and no way of protecting themselves from anything. And Sir Ian Holm made an excellent, creepy, sneaky bastard. It was less about the action than it was about the very real and frightening situation the crew was in. I think the fact that it was normal people up against a super powerful creepy alien made it easier for the average Joe in the audience to feel scared and think about what he or she would do in that situation. For instance, I'm pretty sure I would die. Haha. I'd probably die too, but we all will at some point. Might as well go out with a chest-bursting bang!    Valkyrie Cain and Tanith Low (Skulduggery Pleasant)

Tally Youngblood (Uglies)

Ella (Ella Enchanted)

Alanna (Song of the Lioness)

Matilda (Matilda)

Lyra (Golden Compass)

Hazel Grace Lancaster (The Fault in Our Stars)

Karana (Island of the Blue Dolphins)

Anyway, those are the ones that really struck me. All fictional, although I believe Karana is based off of real life. Good books.

In that time we haven't spent more than 4 nights away from eachother, always at his house. This place is considered "home." There's been minimal issues. Things get rectified quickly. We get along swell.

We currently have a 9-6 grind style life, especially the last 4 months since I settled into my new job. Wake up, pack his lunch, go to work, come home with his spare set of keys, make dinner, have sexytimes, shower, sleep. The L words have been exchanged recently. We're both young and in good professions making good money together.

We're pretty happy.
And he's suggested I move in. The only thing that will change is where my mail goes to and to sign onto the lease.

However, his ex, who he's still on good terms with, lived there with him for 6 years. Shared that bed. Some of her stuff is still there. I avoid it all, and don't say anything, as they must have been happy together for a long time and he genuinely loved her. I was pretty threatened by her at first, but that's all gone away. I've met her and she seems like a genuinely nice girl.

He's asked me to just bring my computer over and sign the lease with him. I said I'd rather wait til the one year mark... and also that I'm a little concerned I'll be OFFICIALLY pushing in on something that's not my place to push into. During this quiet discussion, he made it known he'll finish cleaning out her stuff, so I "feel comfortable opening any cupboard, any drawer, any room."

He's been respectful, but I feel like it's wrong officially moving into somewhere where they must have had some pretty good times together. It feels a little wrong on my behalf.

I'm waiting until the 12 month mark to make it official or at least see how everything is then. Because once that's signed, it's so much harder to leave if things go south. This seems sensible and sane.

Have other women felt like this before? I really don't want to step on something that it's not my place to be.   I live in the house that my bf shared with his ex for two years. None of her stuff is there. I rearranged the bedroom, set up my own room, did some painting, and made the place mine. I think if he's on board with redecorating and understands why you would want to, then go for it. :) good luck  Honestly, it sounds like you should wait. It sounds like you're quite early in your relationship, and it also sounds as if he has some of his past relationship stuff to work out. Don't rush into something just because he needs someone else on the lease.  He definitely doesn't need someone else, I'm sorry, I should have made that clear. He takes care of bills, and rent and whatnot. And (I offered!) have been taking care of weekly groceries, all the cooking and cleaning and house making. Both work full time. I've been slow and careful, it would have been too easy to have moved in 3 months ago for example, but I'd like to wait. Slow and steady lol.  Is it at all feasible to wait until his lease ends so the two of you can start somewhere fresh and new (and neutral) to both of you? I've considered it in my mind, but I can't say I've brought it to the table. It's a really nice little place he's looked after well, and he's settled in there. I guess this is more of just me rambling searching for other women's views on the topic. 
My best lady friend moved in very early with her partner and they've had nothing but issues, but she still (admirably) stands by him and her decision. So what's left to do but ask Reddit, lol.   </snippet></document><document><title>I really don't know where to begin with this...

There is no such thing. There are outfits that flatter certain body types more than others, sure, but I think you found out today that thinking only a skinny girl can pull off this outfit is bullshit. Erase that type of thinking from your mind and you'll be much happier for it!
Also, same goes for "only a curvy girl can pull this off."

[deleted] So what? If she's currently in the midst of weight loss, let's celebrate that a) she's a lot better off than she was at 275 and has at the very least managed her weight to some extent, and b) she's on her way to being better off than she ever was, especially since she's two pounds (and yes, I know, only two pounds, but still, two whole pounds) lighter than she's been in ten years.

And one of the big hurdles to weight loss and healthy living, at least anecdotally from some of my friends, is the self-conscious way they feel judged if they wear workout clothes and aren't already fit or the way they hate their bodies so much that they can't see the point in treating them right. Not giving a fuck about what others think and only caring about being what you want to be, which should include being healthy, is sometimes the first step to not giving a fuck. i actually weigh about 175 now, so i'm much less than where i was in that post that this creep dug up in my comment history! :) so really i'm 20 pounds lighter than i've been in 10 whole years. Congratulations! I was pretty proud of you when I thought what that asshole said was true, and now I'm super proud of you! Weight loss is tough, and you've made a lot of progress. I hope you get to your ideal weight, but until then, keep rockin' the skinny girl clothes and not giving fucks. thanks buddy! i should never have said i was a fatty. i feel like that's what spurned all this hatred. i'm a size 10 now, so it's really not so bad! only 20 pounds to go, and i don't care if it takes me another 10 years. Probably. But seriously, why do people just assume that anyone who is fat, whether they self-identify that way as you do in spite of your relative normalsizedness or are legitimately obese, is not working to be healthier? I just don't get all the fat hate. Yes, obesity is a problem, population-wise, but I would never judge an individual for their weight and no one that I work with in obesity research would, either. Lifestyle choices, though, whether smoking frequently or eating a Big Mac every day, those I'll judge anyone of any weight on.

Ok, I'll get off my soapbox and just wish you luck on your weight loss journey! [deleted] so a gain of 20 pounds over the course of ~10 years, then a 25 pound loss that i'm continuing with no problems... counts as a lifelong failure? or constant? in any way? what i see is a lifelong downward trend in weight. 

why are you so interested in my weight loss that you actually went through my comment history to find out details? that's unbelievably creepy. and what if you are actually completely dead on accurate about this? then what? who in their godly right mind cares? what on earth are you trying to prove? 

or maybe you just created an aptly named account for the sole purpose of finding potentially "vulnerable" strangers on the internet, armchair psycho-analyze them, and decide that you are a better, less lonely person for it. just stop. it's pathetic, and incredibly unproductive to say the least. i'm trying to help you. you need to get over the fundamental problem, your overwhelming desire to lose weight, instead of just having temporary moments of not giving a fuck. the kind of dissonant and undirected life you're living will ultimately be bad for you. what you just said is good advice, but it continues to assume a whole lot about me that just isn't true. the rest of everything you said is presumptuous, judgmental, completely out of line, and downright insulting. more importantly, i never asked for your help. nobody did. [deleted] caring &#8800; "chronic inability to lose weight," "overwhelming desire to lose weight," or "lack of willpower." most women care about their weight. 

and why you care either way is beyond me. it's my life and i'll blow up to 500 pounds if i damn well please. who. cares.

 Abdullah has taken a stance for a long time now that he wants to progress the position of women in Saudi Arabia. It's a big part of the reason he's loved by so many there.

Any of you lovely ladies have advice or experiences to share?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18wm2b/im_about_to_enter_a_longdistance_relation_ship/</url><snippet>I'm headed off for a semester abroad and am leaving my boyfriend of almost a year behind at my home university. I know 5 months isn't forever to be gone, but he's been my rock through the past year, and I'm really thankful to have him, it hurts to have to leave him behind. I was looking for some advice on how others have dealt with long-distance relationships in the past and any tips you ladies have to keep the relationship alive over the distance. 

The time difference is 14 hours and shipping to and from my country is insanely expensive. I also have limited access to internet, so I'm not sure what the best way to communicate will be. 

I'm sorry if this is a re-post or overasked question, this is my first post on 2XC, I usually just lurk. Any advice or stories would be greatly appreciated, and would make this transition a lot easier for me. Thank you all!  Well, I just hope you can figure out a way to communicate because that is really the most important thing in any LDR.
I also recommend /r/LongDistance :) It has some great people that are usually very supportive and they can probably answer your questions better.  </snippet></document><document><title>"plus" size and damn sexy. </title><url>http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/these-women-are-plus-size-according-to-america</url><snippet>   No, the fashion industry thinks these women are "plus size", which refers to the size of professional models.

America thinks [this](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-9479-body-shape.htm#img) is average size. It is the actual average size of women in America. And [this](http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/257024/slide_257024_1644551_free.jpg?1350405857000) is almost unanimously considered sexy today in magazines and the internet...

This is just about fashion showing women of a certain body type preferentially. Just because it's the average doesn't make it good or attractive - this goes for a country's average, fashion industry's average, lingerie model's average, etc.

Still, I'm surprised to learn the size of the average American female. I'd have assumed it was around size 8 - 12... Any stats on the average European woman's size? Trying to look, but coming up short - also working on something at the moment so not a ton of time to google-fu. From the CDC average waist is 37.5 inches... that should be around 45 inch hips so a size 18 pants or 16 depending on brand.

French women are reportedly similar height but 139 pounds on average... but that was 2007 it may have gone up. No, the fashion industry thinks these women are "plus size", which refers to the size of professional models.

This is just about fashion showing women of a certain body type preferentially. I'm quite surprised that the size of an average American woman is 5'4'' and 178 lbs.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with the way that woman looks, she's beautiful.  But healthwise, we definitely need some work.  Yeah, the fashion industry's definition of "plus" is a bit wonky. Basically, think of it this way: they use size 0/2 models for clothes that run from 0-12, and use size 8-12 models for clothes that often run 16+. It's skewed. But nevertheless, I'm glad plus size models are getting more visible just for the sake of celebrating different types of beauty. Case in point: just 3 years ago, FOX and ABC banned a lingerie commercial featuring plus-size models (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiGt6bjk0NM). But they played (and continue to play!) Victoria's Secret commercials all the live-long day. The take-away? Plus size bodies are somehow inappropriate/obscene, but straight-size bodies are alright. Hopefully if Lane Bryant made that commercial in, say, 2 years, it would air. Times are a'changin'.  Yeah, the fashion industry's definition of "plus" is a bit wonky.

S.O. left me stranded after saying he wouldn't.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vyqy/just_venting_so_left_me_stranded_after_saying_he/</url><snippet>This is a little bit of a rant.  I'm just so mad right now that I need to vent.  Hope it's okay to do it here.  

So: my husband and I share a car, which is not a big deal most of the time.  Usually when I need the car, he takes his bike and when he needs the car I bike or take the bus.  And usually when I need the car for going someplace too far to bike/not easily bus-able, it's there.

Well, this morning, I had to be at my internship at 8:30, and although it is technically bus-able, it's a ten-minute drive or else almost an hour by bus due to the fact that buses in a small city aren't always the best, and we had talked last night and agreed that I would have the car, like I do every time I go to this particular internship site (I go to different sites on different days).  Anyway, at 8:15, I go to get in the car and discover that it's not there. Because he took it to work.  After saying that I could have it for the morning, and me scheduling myself based on having the car.

Anyway, I probably should have just gone to my internship late, although it would have been about an hour and a half late by the time I arrived (stupid bus schedule) for a three-hour shift, so I just called out and will make up the time later.  Which is embarrassing, because I was upset and didn't have the presence of mind to say I was sick, so I said I had no ride, but it's not the end of the world or anything, just kind of embarrassing.

Anyway, I am just SO MAD at husband.  SO MAD.  I know it's kind of petty to still be so mad, but it's also my career, and we talked about it last night, so I feel really disregarded, and also I was up early for what turned out to be no reason.  I know that it's not *that* early for most folks, but it is for me, due to crazy schedule that has me burning the candle at both ends.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  I feel like I want to smash something.  I'm sure I'll get over it, but right now I feel so angry and disregarded and there isn't really anything I can do about it.    Maybe if you put the keys in the person's shoe (or bag) that gets the car the next day it will be easier for him to remember whose turn it is?  Why did he take the car?

I would say that in most situations (unless you know differently) don't assume malice if it can be explained by stupidity.  Do you normally have the car on a Wednesday?  Could he have just gone on auto pilot and got in the car and he'll be suitably mortified when he realises that he screwed up?  Random thought: did he perhaps think it's Tuesday because of the holiday on Monday? I don't mean to assume you're in the US and/or had Monday off, but it was my initial gut reaction. We are in the US, but neither one of us got Monday off.  You're totally right, though, that it's probably just a mix-up.  Now if my stupid emotions would just get the memo.   Nah, it's alright to be angry. Now you have to work an extra day because he fucked up, you are paying for his mistake, it's reasonable to be angry.

Having a screaming match over this on the other hand isn't okay. Emotions aren't bad, it's how you handle them.  Hey, I'm pissed for you! I share a parking spot with my roommate and if she takes the spot on a day that we discussed is my day, I get **PISSED!** This happened last night actually and I had to lug the groceries from several blocks away. I would not have bought so many groceries if I knew I wouldn't have the parking spot.

However, while it's okay for you to be this pissed, you should talk yourself down and be much more calm about it when your husband gets home. This is not something to fight over or to yell at him over. This is a situation that only deems a simple comment to him from you: "hey, you took the car today - did you remember it was my day? I need you to please *be sure* it's your day to take the car before you do because my entire schedule is planned around whether I'm taking the car or the bus and I missed my shift today because I was thrown off by you taking the car on my car day. Please be more considerate." </snippet></document><document><title>The latest Zen Pencils creation. Wonderful. </title><url>http://zenpencils.com/comic/104-malala-yousafzai-i-have-the-right/</url><snippet>   If anyone wonders how she is doing, she was released from the hospital at the beginning of January.  She still has a lot of rehab though, and at the beginning of this month she had yet another surgery to help reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing.  
  
Bless the child who suffers. She who has faced death and still believes in her cause.

There's an odd something about someone who chose to take a 7.62x39mm through the skull for her beliefs, lived and continues to carry and fight for those beliefs. I think I would be struck silent in her presence because anything I could say or do would just seem so superfluous. I think the only thing I could do is ask what I could do to help.

(Sorry, random dude from r/all. I'll butt out if I'm not supposed to be in here or whatever.) Right? My biggest accomplishments have been getting decent grades and finally moving out of my Dad's house. Reading things like this make me feel like such a small person - but hey, that's all right with me as long as people like Malala keep pushing on.

And don't be scared to drop in and say a few words! We don't bite :) The thing I'm having trouble grasping is that she's just a small person too... so many hopes, dreams, sorrows and flaws all wrapped together like we all are. Yet there in the middle of this she was and she had the courage not just to face down a gunman and accept death to protect others, but the courage to attend those classes every day and speak up about her beliefs that she knew were so dangerous to hold in her land.

Also I've been thinking for most of tonight about the word gunman. It's dehumanizing, but in a particularly apt way I think. Once you've used a gun to press your point you're no longer a man (or woman, pronouns are shite and please excuse their shiteness) you are a *gun*man... a thing that finds things that don't agree and shoots them. You're not a thinker, a good friend, a parent or an artist. You gave that up in a way and you're now little more than a remote drone made of meat that kills things that disagree. Tears down monuments of great antiquity because they offend you somehow. 

It's a weird thing that can make a person into so much less. A weird thing that can make a man threaten a van full of school children. A weird thing that can make a man put a bullet through a girl's skull because she wanted to learn. He's not a man anymore, just a gunman. I have the hardest time even fathoming what's going on in the gunman's head. A woman trying to be educated and being vocal about it? Kill. It just shows how absolutely dehumanized these people are; that not only does a woman wanting an education so badly anger them to no end, but that they will even kill over it. They will kill to try to keep women stupid, essentially.

Beyond being infuriating, it's seriously just baffling to me. I can't imagine someone telling me any amount of things that would make my beliefs reconcile with the gunman's. The world is a strange place. I have the hardest time even fathoming what's going on in the gunman's head. A woman trying to be educated and being vocal about it? Kill.

Beyond being infuriating, it's seriously just baffling to me. I can't imagine someone telling me any amount of things that would make my beliefs reconcile with the gunman's. The world is a strange place. A great deal of it has to do with men losing their standing in society. Women are becoming educated, which is a serious threat to men, who have always been head of the household, made all decisions and who essentially ruled their families. 

An education for women represents a serious social shift. And, couple that with a lot of young men being out of jobs, being out of their homes, having no money - generally disinfranchised - and they see a woman, a person they previously lorded over, their last reserve of someone to have power over, receiving an education and loosening that grip of absolute authority.  

Women are now in school, doing just as well (if not sometimes better) than men. Women are in the workforce because they are educated, which means a man doesn't always know what is best for his family. A man is no longer needed, he is obsolete because a woman can care for her self and her family. 

Faced with becoming obsolete, young men are taking it out on women to re-find and re-assert their place in a society that, for millennium, has been defined and structured by gender roles.      She who has faced death and still believes in her cause.

It's a weird feeling, but not necessarily a bad one.  I just feel sick and overwhelmed. I just feel sick and overwhelmed.   My eyes are leaking. My eyes are leaking. My eyes are leaking.    Wow.  As beautiful as this is -and inspiring, it still hurts a bit to see. 

A friend put it best... things that suck = "Turning little girls like Malala Yousafzai into symbols of resistance in war zones. Consequently turning them into worse targets of violence back home."

The Pakistani government changed the name of the school she attended to Malala's name. As a consequence, the Taliban targeted it more and many of the students began to hate her. She herself asked the gov. to change the name of it back.

All this press, while at first seemed great, now probably means that she will never be able to return to Pakistan without it having some sort of adverse effect on her family, friends, classmates, and anyone else she interacts with. 

This is a child. She deserves her merits wholeheartedly, but that Nobel Prize hurts her in the long run.  I was hoping she would win the Nobel prize but your post totally changed my mind. I never thought about it like that, thank you. Yeah, me too. Maybe one day, in years to come, when she's a grown woman and hopefully her country is more peaceful. But right now? No. That is a good thought. She may have many more years of good works ahead of her, things that may be different with the notoriety a Nobel prize can give.

But right now, she's still pretty notorious (in a good way, of course). The Girl Who Lived? That in itself will make people nervous, angry, and violent.  Yeah, me too.

This is a child. She deserves her merits wholeheartedly, but that Nobel Prize hurts her in the long run.  At the same time, she has the opportunity to get the hell out of that backwards place until its safe. She can ultimately get what she wants, a safe education and be respected as a woman. If she goes back she of course will cause a shitstorm, but I personally think she has done more than anyone could have asked of her and doesn't have to go back. She's done enough. So it is bittersweet because you know she *is* getting something better, and perhaps will be able to live without fear of her life, but at the same she still will be scarred by the evil in this world and holds a political burden no child should have to bear. It is NOT a backwards place and she is NOT the only person, hell, the only woman who advocates for such things. 

Pakistan has some prestigious universities (that are co-ed). The main reason for Pakistan's instability is its government and it's economy, which has gone down the gutter. Those are the two main reasons. Pakistan has cities like New York (Karachi) and San Francisco (Lahore), for example. There are millions of women in Pakistan who do hold jobs and have an education and are respected, however it is not the majority. Malala is from Swat Valley, which the government has little control over if I remember correctly. 

I don't she will be able to live without some sort of fear. The Taliban are some fucked up people who I'm sure have contacts in other countries. I am glad you do realize it is a terrible political burden on a child, so I appreciate that.

For the record, regarding women and education in Pakistan. My Pakistani grandmother received a degree equivalent to a masters in India (before the Pakistan partition). She went on to teach at a girl's school in Pakistan for over 40 years and she was principal for some of that time. She was a Girls Guide leader (Pakistani equivalent of Girl Scouts, yes, that exists). The middle and upper class in Pakistan tend to have hired help. My grandma was middle class and after her hired help aided her with household stuff, she would sit with them and teach them (these hired help are usually women) to read and write in Urdu. 

My middle-class aunts are all educated and hold college degrees from Pakistani universities. They made sure all their kids did, as well. Two of my female cousins are now working on their PHDs at a Pakistani univeristy and are professors for MBA programs there. Pakistan is NOT a backwards place and the burden of women's education was not simply carried only by Malala. Malala is one we hear about because she was shot by the Taliban -American prime enemy number 1.  As beautiful as this is -and inspiring, it still hurts a bit to see.

Are you familiar with Taslima Nasreen? She, too, spoke her mind about her country and as a result, will never be able to go back to it. She still speaks and writes, but outside Bangladesh (and there are many in India -- her current home -- who don't want her there either.)

At this point, I think Malala's fate will be similar; I simply cannot see her being able to go back in safety. Even if she is under protection of the government, if the government changes, she would be vulnerable again.

There *is* a tendency for Western media to single out one particular woman - Malala, Mukhtar Mai, Amina Lawal - and use her as a symbol of the 'success' of women's struggle in regions where they are the exception, rather than the rule. As you mentioned, this could actually be a case of one step forward, two steps back.

Edit: How do I Reddit? The book is also amazing. If you loved the film, you should read the book, because there are some important differences between both of them.        Religion ladies and gentlemen. The taliban called her an infidel and her statements obscenity. Say what you will about the beauty of religion, but it disgusts me how much it's used to keep women down.  This is the same type of infantile thinking that got Malala killed.  You obviously know nothing about Afghanistan or the Taliban or the history of that part of the world to blame all of this on "religion. " There are tons of Muslims that hate this type of thing. 

The Taliban is barely a religious movement either.  They are a tribal movement based on Pashtun nationalism, and they justify their actions using Islam because Islam is considered a noble thing in the eyes of many people in the Middle East.  It's the same way that America  justifies bombing its enemies using "freedom" and "democracy."  People generally like freedom, so that's why support America when it bombs people.  Same with the Taliban.  

Most of what the Taliban do isn't even based on the Quran.  They are vicious thugs that do these kinds of things because they want to keep power in Afghanistan.  They know that an educated, open society is naturally going to start clamoring for democracy and their own tribal leaders will no longer be respected.   &amp;gt;This is the same type of infantile thinking that got Malala killed.

So if Christians hate the Westborrow Baptist Church then it's not at all to blame on religion?......Listen, before you tune out what I just said please take a step back and consider that. Both groups believe in their hearts that they're doing the right thing and they do what they do at least in part because of their religious beliefs. 

&amp;gt; They know that an educated, open society is naturally going to start clamoring for democracy and their own tribal leaders will no longer be respected.

You realize this is religion we're talking about. This is one of the major reasons why religion exists.  &amp;gt; So if Christians hate the Westborrow Baptist Church then it's not at all to blame on religion?

Anybody that talks about "religion" like its one monolothic thing can't be taken seriously.  The word religion is just a word; in reality "religion" manifests itself as a huge diversity of opinions, practices, beliefs, traditions, cultures.  Generalizing religion is just about the most intellectually lazy thing a person can do.  It's like saying "oh so because I saw a black guy smoked crack that can't be blamed on black people at all???"

&amp;gt; Both groups believe in their hearts that they're doing the right thing and they do what they do at least in part because of their religious beliefs.

Yes, those people are assholes.  What does that have to do with "religion" though?  There are religious people that don't think like that at all... so how do you explain those people?  There are assholes in all walks of life, and most assholes use something to justify their assholishness... Marxism, religion, feminism, racism, etc....  You can't blame "feminism" for every dumb thing every feminist says, you can't blame "socialism" for every evil thing every Socialist does, etc... 

&amp;gt; You realize this is religion we're talking about. This is one of the major reasons why religion exists.

Once again, talking about "religion" like its one simple thing makes it hard for me to take you seriously.   Oh geez, it's one of these folks..... 

I like how you compare religion to race, that is so fundamentally ignorant. Religion is a belief system, skin color is something that you're born with. We can also scientifically observe race and see that it has very little effect on individuals in comparison to things like class and location. But belief systems are things that children are commonly indoctrinated in, they're often statements of faith, etc... This is incredibly different from race, please don't be ignorant enough to compare the two in the future. 

Yes, there are assholes in every walk of life. However, unlike feminism, there is often an omniscient god, a set of core beliefs that are supposed to be followed, laws/beliefs/suggestions/etc..., it is not intellectually honest to compare a religion to a political ideology or racial bias, they do not entail the same things. That's like comparing a hired/self-motivated assassin to a mugger, a mugger is mostly just an asshole, an assassin has motives for what he's doing.

Honestly though all of what I just said means nothing if you seriously want to cling to the idea that you can never generalize religion, or I guess anything. If you're seriously just blindly opposed to generalizing then I can't argue with you at all... I mean, racists will use generalizations to explain their hatred toward a group, but intellectuals will generalize races to explain economic disparity and environmental differences.  [deleted] k

I would never claim that I lack ignorance, because obviously everyone lacks knowledge. Further, I don't see why you'd report me when you said that I was an infantile thinker and intellectually lazy, are you really trying to say you have the higher ground here? 

If you wanted to forfeit your argument, I really don't mind. But there's no reason to be so dramatic about it.  You are being intellectually lazy by saying religion is a problem. Eradicating religion is probably not possible (because no one agrees on exactly what constitutes religion) and would get us nowhere in eradicating oppression and injustice.  Oh geez, it's one of these folks..... 

I like how you compare religion to race, that is so fundamentally ignorant. Religion is a belief system, skin color is something that you're born with. We can also scientifically observe race and see that it has very little effect on individuals in comparison to things like class and location. But belief systems are things that children are commonly indoctrinated in, they're often statements of faith, etc... This is incredibly different from race, please don't be ignorant enough to compare the two in the future. 

Yes, there are assholes in every walk of life. However, unlike feminism, there is often an omniscient god, a set of core beliefs that are supposed to be followed, laws/beliefs/suggestions/etc..., it is not intellectually honest to compare a religion to a political ideology or racial bias, they do not entail the same things. That's like comparing a hired/self-motivated assassin to a mugger, a mugger is mostly just an asshole, an assassin has motives for what he's doing.

Honestly though all of what I just said means nothing if you seriously want to cling to the idea that you can never generalize religion, or I guess anything. If you're seriously just blindly opposed to generalizing then I can't argue with you at all... I mean, racists will use generalizations to explain their hatred toward a group, but intellectuals will generalize races to explain economic disparity and environmental differences.  Race is not just skin color. It's a social construct as much as religion is and, much like religion, its implications have everything to do with specific temporal, geographic, and historical contexts. There's not even a single consensus on what "religion" means. Religion ladies and gentlemen. The taliban called her an infidel and her statements obscenity. Say what you will about the beauty of religion, but it disgusts me how much it's used to keep women down.  Just because the Taliban uses a discourse of religion doesn't mean that the problem is religion. Malala's father is religious himself and supports his daughter's efforts. Patriarchy and religion may overlap often, but they are not one and the same.

The Taliban does not represent Islam, it represents the Taliban.  No one represents Islam in my view, every muslim makes up what is the larger image of Islam.  The Taliban is not oppressive because they're Muslims... So none of them take views out of the quran for treating women like they're less than men? 

I guess the quran is incredibly supportive of women, right?

Obviously it isn't.  So because much of American entertainment media is degrading to women, we should eradicate all forms of entertainment media completely?

What can you tell me about the Taliban's interpretation of the Qur'an, specifically? What do you think is the agenda of the Taliban? American media isn't lead by a belief in an omnipotent/omniscient god. there's a difference. I guess that goes back to my comparison between a mugger and an assassin, a mugger will kill someone for money, but it's random. An assassin has an intent to go out and kill a certain person. 

Look up on google. "afghan women under the taliban" by nancy hatch dupree. I mean, read anything about the taliban online, they are very open and honest about using religion to keep women submissive. I appreciate you trying to defend them, but it's not like they try and hide it.  Religion ladies and gentlemen. The taliban called her an infidel and her statements obscenity. Say what you will about the beauty of religion, but it disgusts me how much it's used to keep women down.  &amp;gt; Religion ladies and gentlemen. 

You're painting with far too broad a brush, there.  Nope, not at all. 

I'm saying "religion ladies and gentlemen." because of the actions of those members of religions who take the religion to it's extreme. These guys used religion to keep a young and intelligent girl down, I hope they get bathed in pig's blood.  Yeah, but you didn't say "Radical Islam" or "Radical religion" or even "Islam, ladies and gentleman." You just said religion. That's like saying "Weather, ladies and gentleman" after a tsunami when "weather" can also apply to light rain.  Is weather responsible for tsunamis and hurricanes? We accept the good with the bad, but that doesn't mean it's not responsible for the bad. 

I don't blame "radical weather" for the things I don't like about weather. I know that it's all a part of a whole.  The problem is that religion is a *far* broader term than weather, and you've successfully communicated to me that I should have used a different example. Let's go another way: compare Jainism to Islam. Sure, you can argue that we still have the problem of people believing things without (good enough) evidence (and perhaps that's all you meant by your comment "religion, ladies and gentleman," but you didn't say that outright), but Jainism is one religion where the *more fundamentalist you get*, the *less* likely you are to harm others.  Wait, so you're argument is that Jainism isn't violent, so religious extremism doesn't affect all religions? That's just showing that religions are really diverse, I agree that they're diverse. If you think I didn't take Jainism into account when I said "Religion ladies and gentlmen", then I think you're too optimistic. 

I think we should all choose to disregard religion, I'd be really happy if we could do that.  No, I was simply saying that: 

a) religious extremism doesn't have to be violent

b) Your statement "Religion, ladies and gentlemen," leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what you actually meant by it. It's very vague. You're replying to an instance of religious fundamentalist violence, so it would've been better to clarify if you thought that all religious people (fundamentalist or not) are violent, or if you meant the countless other things one could glean from that statement (believing things without good enough evidence, etc).

&amp;gt; I think we should all choose to disregard religion, I'd be really happy if we could do that.

If you mean stop subscribing to it, I *might* get on board. But it's not a simple thing to abolish (in fact I doubt abolishing it is possible). If you mean stop studying it and its effect on people, I very much disagree.  You never asked me to expand on what I said, you assumed I was talking about violence. Next time ask me what I mean please. And I'm not talking about abolishing it, that's why I said we should choose to disregard religion. An educated populace shouldn't fall for scams like religion. I'm not against education, if everyone was educated in religions then there would probably be fewer religious folks. Wait, so you're argument is that Jainism isn't violent, so religious extremism doesn't affect all religions? That's just showing that religions are really diverse, I agree that they're diverse. If you think I didn't take Jainism into account when I said "Religion ladies and gentlmen", then I think you're too optimistic. 

I think we should all choose to disregard religion, I'd be really happy if we could do that.  Religion can be used for good just as it can be used for evil. [Islamic feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_feminism) exists, and [Christian liberation theology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) played an instrumental role in the opposition against third world dictatorships. Not saying that there aren't good parts to religion. None of that absolves religion of it's larger problems, so it's not worth mentioning. Yeah, but you didn't say "Radical Islam" or "Radical religion" or even "Islam, ladies and gentleman." You just said religion. That's like saying "Weather, ladies and gentleman" after a tsunami when "weather" can also apply to light rain.  Um, you shouldn't say "Islam, ladies and gentlemen," either. That's kind of offensive, especially to Muslims. Islam isn't worse than any other religion out there.  Kind of missing my point, and that's also a matter of debate that I'd rather not get in to.  All right then, what is your point? 

By saying that, it sounds like you are a bit prejudiced towards Islam, much like a lot of reddit. I made my point in the post to which you responded. The person was speaking too broadly and too vaguely, so I suggested they specify what they meant. Whether Islam is worse than some other religions is a separate debate. If this were a response to an abortion clinic bombing in the U.S., for example, I would've said the exact same things, replacing "Radical Islam" and "Islam" with "Radical Christianity" and "Christianity."  Okay, but I really can't see how Islam is worse than other religions. Just curious, are you willing to share what your personal religion is, if any?

I'm an atheist, so not a huge fan of religion in general, but I really don't understand why people think Islam is somehow worse than other religions. That's pretty offensive to Muslims, in my opinion.             I've never heard of this girl before, but now that I've read (the basics of) her story, I really hope that she continues to live up to her fame. What happened to her was horrible, but in one way, she's been given a gift: how many other people are there out there who are that close to being a living martyr? With that kind of influence, who knows what she could be capable of?

[](/I think Malala is a cool guy. Eh defies the Taliban and doesn't afraid of anything.) A gift? Really?

....

I mean, really?

She was shot in the fucking head and you think that's a gift because she "gets" to be a fucking living martyr? Oh lucky her! How about giving her the freedom to live her life the way she wants to rather than expecting anything from her? She does not need to live up to whatever "fame" standards/expectations you or anyone else sets for her.

She's fucking done enough.

   When did education become a basic right...I mean if you are paying for education via taxation yeah you should get it...but that doesn't make it a basic right When did education become a basic right...I mean if you are paying for education via taxation yeah you should get it...but that doesn't make it a basic right Even if you don't recognize it as a basic right, surely a government that gives it to boys should also give it to girls? When did education become a basic right...I mean if you are paying for education via taxation yeah you should get it...but that doesn't make it a basic right When did education become a basic right...I mean if you are paying for education via taxation yeah you should get it...but that doesn't make it a basic right When did education become a basic right...I mean if you are paying for education via taxation yeah you should get it...but that doesn't make it a basic right Do the words "pursuit of happiness" mean anything to do? 

Either way, how would you liked her to have phrased her defense for desiring an education that she wasn't allowed to pursue JUST BECAUSE SHE HAS A VAGINA? I think "basic right" is the perfect way to phrase that, even if it doesn't fit into your semantically appropriate definition. Life, Liberty and Property

The constitution in the US said pursuit of happiness because we didn't want to include black people.

Education is a service.   It has costs and an exchange value.   Therefore it is a commodity and not a basic right.   Keep in mind that doesn't make it okay for someone to deny someone an education to which they are entitled via taxation because they are a woman.   I am just saying that when we call all the things that we think are essential as basic human rights, we would be misunderstanding what exactly that means. Since rights in their physical manifestations are social constructs, rights are pretty much whatever society defines them as.

If you want to talk about an abstract, philosophical definition of "rights," you're getting into somewhat subjective territory that, again, has room for disagreement about what really constitutes a right. I would argue rights can't have a cost even if looking at them as a social construct.</snippet></document><document><title>What are your tactics for dealing with your terrible MIL?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18uqq5/what_are_your_tactics_for_dealing_with_your/</url><snippet>
My bf and I have been seriously dating for a few years. We live together, my family loves him, we occasionally talk marriage (though I know I won't be ready for at *least* another 5 years), and we're always looking to the future for new adventures. 

Unfortunately, my boyfriend's Mother is a doozy and I'm starting to realize I can't just avoid social situations with her if I plan on any kind of future with him. I used to go out of my way to be as friendly as possible to her: inviting her over for lunch once or twice a month, making homemade gifts for her birthday and Mothers Day, and always bringing a dessert when she invites us over, but nothing helps. She's spiteful, a rageaholic, racist (she's biologically Hispanic, raised in an Italian family and seems to take issue with literally any race that she doesn't personally identify as), and possibly bipolar. Here is a small sampling of her recent antics:

* I overheard her telling her teenaged daughter (my bfs half-sister) that it was a shame he only dated girls like me, then referred to me as "the whitest of the white". I'm Irish and French, so I'm pretty aware of how pale I am, but she never apologized or even seemed embarrassed that I'd heard.

* Had her license revoked and her car impounded for evading the police when they tried to pull her over (we're talking blowing through red lights at 8-9pm, and she doesn't see how dangerous and reckless that is), but continues to drive her daughter's car everywhere like a maniac. We've asked her to please not pick us up when we come to visit, because we can easily walk from the train station to her house but she refuses to respect our wishes and will drive along side us on the street while we walk.

* Someone from her church died and left her a condo. She sold it for almost 100 grand and blew the money on cars and electronics within a month. She never pays her bills and is in danger of losing her house.

* Got arrested on her lunch break for assaulting a woman in the street that "bumped into her". My bf had to find out from her boss when she didn't show at work after her break and had him listed as an emergency contact. The boss was obviously panicked and very worried. Again, his Mom blew it off like it didn't matter.

* We were displaced for a month after Hurricane Sandy and stayed with her for two days. She managed to make us even more stressed than we already were by taking her boyfriend (who is 17 years her junior) to get a lie detector test to prove he wasn't cheating on her. He failed. She left him there (the place was within walking distance to her house where we were staying) and then proceeded to bait him by sending texts saying, "don't come by the house, I'm driving to Long Island with my new man". She straight up put us in danger because of the high she was getting by making this guy jealous. As recently as last week, she talked about them still being together.

* When my boyfriend confronted her about how mean she is to me, she told him, "it's not my fault you have terrible taste in women.". But more recently when I haven't been coming along with him to visit her, she's vocal about that fact that I'm not there.

* When she isn't berating me, she's asking me when I'm going to "give her a grandchild". I've been very upfront with everyone in my family that I don't want kids. My Mom even jokes that I never played with baby dolls or even liked kids when I was one. Literally everyone in my life is supportive about this but this woman. She calls my bf up and tells him about "grand baby" dreams she had the night before and gets pissy when it annoys him.

At this point, I've realized there is nothing I can do to make her a nice person or make her approve of me. I know that I've been nothing but lovely to her and she'd rather use me as a scapegoat. I realize she lives a sad and lonley life and she is too stubborn to admit it. All I'm looking for are some ways to deal with her. I know I'm not the only one dealing with terrible in-laws. Any advice?    My MIL is... well... a psycho. I won't bore you with all the details, but suffice to say she is one of the very few people I've ever met who I genuinely believe are evil (and I'm in my 40's so have a decent amount of life experience for comparison) - and I don't say that lightly.

I let my husband set the tone (and I'd be fine cutting her out of our lives completely, but he isn't).  I treat her the way I handle difficult work people. Firmly, politely, giving no grounds for a grudge (for sane people anyway) - but straight up no BS. Boundaries are tight and enforced. 

I don't care what she thinks of me; I will not allow her to railroad me into anything; she doesn't scare me or intimidate me; and should she try to hurt me the way she did my husband's first wife - she'd be the one sitting inside a jail cell so fast her head would spin. I'm always (very) polite - but she knows that her drama and shit-fests cut no ice with me.  Not surprisingly, she's not tried anything nearly as jaw-droppingly heinous as her past efforts to exert control over her son and his family.  She cannot exert control that we do not give her (and she therefore does not possess).

Understand that there is nothing you can do to win or lose your BF's Mum's approval (no matter what she says).  That alone can be very freeing.  There's nothing to "win".  Be the nicer person, but don't be a doormat.  Don't allow her negativity to occupy so much as a second's worth of thoughts in your mind. She only has whatever power you give to her.

Eg: Evidently something the hubby or I did (or didn't do) at Thanksgiving pissed off MIL.  She's been giving us the silent treatment ever since (and making sure we were aware via FB and family that she was in town and ignoring us).  Do we care? Not. one. iota.  Have we asked her what's up? Nope.  Are we stressing over it? Nope. Are we trying to get back in her good graces? Never gonna happen. If anything, we're mildly amused - waiting until she pops a cork and tells us what we did that's so heinous (hint: nothing legitimate). Next time we need to deal with her will be at Brother-in-Law's wedding.  Should be fun (I believe I'll be on Valium duty so the poor bride doesn't have to deal with her shit)!

Good luck!  If you aren't capable of the detachment you need to treat her the way I treat mine, then as other folks have suggested, have your BF be the only one in contact with her. Thank you for this. Honestly, my biggest thing right now is how I'll handle it long term (provided we end up hitched, eventually) so it's great to hear this from someone that's dealing with it. Minutes after I posted this, I came across an article on narcissistic mothers and I'm totally convinced that's her deal. One of the many, many convincing points was this, "The envy of narcissistic mothers often includes competing sexually with their daughters or daughters-in-law. They will criticize the appearance of their daughters and daughters-in-law. This envy extends to relationships. Narcissistic mothers infamously attempt to damage their children's marriages and interfere in the upbringing of their grandchildren."  I'm dealing with some of the same issues with my fiance's mother. I actually googled that quote and read the article, and while not all of it applies, the part about manipulating siblings to resent each other is spot on for her. The most disparaging thing is that she lords over my fiance's finances, even though he's a grown man who doesn't receive financial help from her, criticizing even small purchases. Every purchase, even across the country, we have to worry about how she will react, because she has access to his bank statements. My fiance helped me out of a bind last month, which I promptly payed him back for, but apparently she threw a fit about that. It's definitely frustrating to think about handling the emotional manipulation long term. Dude, you are marrying this guy. You really need him to change banks or account numbers. This is seriously not okay. I'm dealing with some of the same issues with my fiance's mother.

Good luck!  If you aren't capable of the detachment you need to treat her the way I treat mine, then as other folks have suggested, have your BF be the only one in contact with her. What did she do to his first wife? So many things.  The one that struck me as the most gratuitously cruel was this (and this wasn't just his first wife, but their whole family):

My husband's daughter had cancer (one that was fairly rare at the time) so they relocated to be near the doctor that was pioneering treatment for that particular type. The doctor/hospital was near where the mother lived, so first wife and daughter went on ahead - were to stay with MIL - while husband drove the U-Haul with all their belongings, with the help of a friend of the MIL.  So far, sounds like a nice thing to do to help them.

Except, instead, MIL picks up first wife and daughter, takes them to the Ronald McDonald house and leaves them on the sidewalk outside with $20.  This is a large city, where neither first wife or daughter had ever been before. They knew nobody but MIL there.  At the same time, MIL's friend leaves husband at a rest stop, taking the truck and leaving him stranded in the middle of nowhere, several states away from where first wife and daughter are now also stranded.

As if that were not enough, when resourceful husband makes his own way to MIL's house (he hitched - this was pre 'everyone has a cell phone' days) to find out WTF had happened to truck/friend, she's been watching for him and calls the cops, alleging that she's afraid for her life and he's going to kill her *before she had even spoken to him*.  Its not until after the cops turn up that husband realizes he's been had - by his mother.

That all took months to work through - time husband spent in jail awaiting a hearing (he was let go when MIL didn't show to testify - leaving prosecution with no case); first-wife spent trying to get by alone in a big city with no money and a desperately ill child.  All because MIL wanted to demonstrate the extent of control she could exert over their lives. Oh, and they never got their stuff back either, leaving them out thousands of dollars in replacing their household stuff.

Fortunately, the daughter's cancer was successfully treated and she's alive and well today. So many things.  The one that struck me as the most gratuitously cruel was this (and this wasn't just his first wife, but their whole family):

Also, you mentioned that he's still in contact with his mother. Why? Would cutting her off mean that he'd be unable to see the rest of the family?   Move to another state, one at least 750 mls away (it discourages casual day trips.) though if she does just turn up it's harder to kick her out. Don't answer the freakin' door! Move to another state, one at least 750 mls away (it discourages casual day trips.)     Smile, nod a lot, and never allow your significant other to leave you alone with her.  My tips (though, my MIL ruined my wedding, so what do I know!?) Oh god, what happened (if you don't mind my asking)? If you could do it over, would you have not invited her? There's no way in hell my Father is getting an invite to mine but that's because I've entirely cut him out of my life. My bf is definitely putting some space between him and his Mother right now but I imagine he'll want her at our wedding since he doesn't have much family other than her and his sister.   YIKES! 

But ya know, honestly, out of all the MIL stories I've read on TwoX, yours isn't the worst. Your MIL is the craziest, for sure, like *literally* mentally unstable, but because your BF seems to be completely of the same mind as you and isn't trying to make excuses for his MIL at all, that makes this situation not as bad as some of the others. Some others complain not just about the MIL but about their BF's taking the MIL's side or not understanding the OP's complaints. But your BF seems to be on your side with this, so that's promising. 

Two things: one, you need to decide if you can handle her in your life forever. You don't necessarily need to decide that yet, as you two aren't even engaged, but eventually you need to decide if she is a deal-breaker for your or not. Because she will never go away. If you marry this man, she will always be there. You need to decide if that is okay with you or not.

Second, I would suggest sitting down with your BF and essentially saying "well, what should we do about your mother?" He knows she's nuts. Does he enjoy spending time with her? Does he want to? You two should be totally on the same page and have the same strategy as to how to deal with her and how often you see her. 

Finally, "inviting her over for lunch once or twice a month" -- well stop that!! Why inflict her onto yourself like that!? I'd ignore her completely until a family birthday or holiday pops up. Does your BF insist you see her this often? Would he be okay with only seeing her on holidays? Or at least with *you* only seeing her on holidays? </snippet></document><document><title>Abortion support?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vfmq/abortion_support/</url><snippet>Im 20 years old and a couple weeks ago i found out i was pregnant.

So they'll be cauterizing the inside of my uterus so that hopefully no, or at least very little new endometrial tissue will be able to grow after that.  This means I'm done with periods, or at least heavy miserable periods, without any of the miserable menopausal side effects, because it's entirely surgical and I'll still be functioning as normal in the ovaries (which I saw on the ultrasound and they are fine and healthy, although the right one was slightly enlarged - I think that's the one I'm ovulating from this month anyway though).  I'm pretty excited, but I was wondering what you ladies' experiences with NovaSure specifically had been.  Yes, I can! I had NovaSure done last July. The worst part of the entire thing was the biopsy they had to do prior to the procedure. (That was a week before.) Since they found nothing wrong, I went in, went to sleep under general anesthesia, and woke up with light bleeding. Well, not really bleeding. More like pink water.

The pink, watery discharge lasted for about 3 weeks. Then I got my first period. The doc had warned me that my first might still be heavy and full of clots because the uterus is just cleaning house. (My first was about half of what it usually was.) She said to give it 3 periods and by the third, you'll have a good idea of what your periods will be like from that point forward. I found my fourth was more accurate.

I went from soaking through a super plus tampon and a heavy pad in 30-45 minutes to not even using a full box of tampons. I use about 8 super tampons and maybe 12 regular. I don't use pads at all, not even overnight. I have a small clot each time and some spotting. My period is so unremarkable for me that I actually can't remember when it was. It's just such a non-issue for me now.

I didn't really have a problem with cramps before, and I don't have them now, so I can't speak to whether the procedure will help that. I did notice a decrease in PMS symptoms that has stayed with me. I still get grumpy, just less. I still have cravings, just less.

One thing to note for others reading this is that you **have** to use some form of birth control/sterilization. (Mr. Gruntled got a vasectomy so it's also a non-issue for me.) If you get pregnant, there isn't enough tissue left to support a growing placenta. The placenta and the fetus can tear off causing a hemorrhage. The brochures all say vague things, such as pregnancy could be life-threatening for both baby and mom, but they're not specific as to why and how. My doc gave me the info.

Good luck! Can I ask you how insurance coverage works with this? I brought it up to my gyn and she quoted something like 3500. Ugh! I don't think she was convinced it was "necessary" so she quoted it as elective. Any insight? Uh, I have really ballin' insurance with like, a $400 deductible, so this entire procedure is going to cost me only like $115 out of pocket because of the special provider network - I didn't even need a precertification - even though I haven't met my deductible yet.

That said, I have really disgustingly heavy periods - not quite as bad as TodayIAmGruntled's, but pretty bad nonetheless - and so I think perhaps my doctor was willing to consider it as more "necessary." My dr. was already peevish with me for asking about sterilization at 27 without kids, so I think I was being "that patient" in her mind. I might try elsewhere. Definitely try elsewhere; my doc was awesome.  I didn't even go in seeking Novasure - he suggested it after I explained that I was basically like, "no kids kthx."

(Like you I am 27 and nulliparous.) Can I ask you how insurance coverage works with this? I brought it up to my gyn and she quoted something like 3500. Ugh!

Quoting this for emphasis.  You'll (the general you, not specifically YOU, TIAG) note that I am having my tubes tied at the same time as this procedure is being done.  The literature is all VERY clear that this procedure is only for women who are done having children. Yep. I have spoken with someone before that didn't know she'd have to use something.

Combining a tubal ligation et al is very common. I *think* IUDs would be out of the question, but that is something for anyone interested to ask their doctor.

One more thing to add, recovery time for the NovaSure procedure is almost nil. Many people have it done under light sedation. I have asthma so I had to do general. I stayed home that day and slept only because of the anesthesia. My uterus and other portions of me felt completely fine. No pain, nothing. Some ladies have cramps afterwards, but my doc only recommended Tylenol.

I strongly feel that if you have rough periods and are done with kids (or not having them), an endometrial ablation is the way to go. I feel like I have my life back. I know it's very brochure-like to say that LOL, but it's totally true. Yes, I can! I had NovaSure done last July.

Good luck! Another thing - how was the pain after surgery for you?  The doctor sent in my prescription way early and, well... it's large.  Do I need to expect to be out of work a full week? Hm, it depends on how they're doing the ligation. I see that you're having a laparotomy done. I've had 3 done. I recall the first one was somewhat painful. It feels like you've pulled your stomach muscles really badly. I took it easy for the Friday they did it and the weekend, but I was back to work by Monday. You might not need the full week. Say you have it done Monday, you'll probably feel up to doing stuff by Thursday or Friday.

You won't have much pain from the NovaSure. Maybe some cramping.</snippet></document><document><title>Deborah Rhodes: A tool that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you</title><url>http://www.ted.com/talks/deborah_rhodes.html?source=reddit#.USQUnI0UDJJ.reddit</url><snippet> </snippet></document><document><title>Alabama State Representative claims a child is "the largest organ in a body."</title><url>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/18/mary-sue-mcclurkin-baby-largest-organ_n_2712812.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&amp;amp;src=sp&amp;amp;comm_ref=false</url><snippet>  This sounds offensive, until you realise that it's completely legal and non-controversial to have organs removed from your body as you please, where as the pro-life position hinges entirely on the idea that foetusses are *not* a part of the mothers body.

Maybe I shouldn't be trying to apply logic to this, though. I agree - this seems to undermine the whole "a fetus is a person" argument, but it seems that she is attempting to use this logic to justify a bill that "would impose stringent requirements on abortion clinics that could make it hard for them to keep their doors open." And that's no good. This sounds offensive, until you realise that it's completely legal and non-controversial to have organs removed from your body as you please, where as the pro-life position hinges entirely on the idea that foetusses are *not* a part of the mothers body.

Maybe I shouldn't be trying to apply logic to this, though. I think that argument breaks down (a bit) when you consider that it isn't legal for a doctor to remove an organ that is necessary for your life to continue - they can't take out your heart (unless it's replaced), they can't take out your liver, they can't remove your brain. The argument here is the same as it always was - it shouldn't be legal to have an abortion because "someone" dies. 

It's still a stupid (and factually incorrect) way to phrase a pro-life argument though.  I see what you're saying, but the argument still doesn't hold water if you look at it like that. The baby is the one being removed from the mother. If you say the baby is just an organ, the mother isn't dying, just a big ol' organ does. Which happens frequently in the medical world. This just a dumb argument all around.  I think that argument breaks down (a bit) when you consider that it isn't legal for a doctor to remove an organ that is necessary for your life to continue - they can't take out your heart (unless it's replaced), they can't take out your liver, they can't remove your brain. The argument here is the same as it always was - it shouldn't be legal to have an abortion because "someone" dies. 

It's still a stupid (and factually incorrect) way to phrase a pro-life argument though.  "Someone else" being key in that argument. My organs, however, by definition are a part of *me* and not some other person. If I could survive without a heart, I could have it removed. I can survive without a foetus in me (moreso for being a man, but never mind that). Oh I wholeheartedly agree, my point is that their argument hasn't changed.  I think some people need to read their 4th grade science text books to learn the definition of an organ. 

Also, compare the size of a fetus with a woman's skin, liver, intestines, and maybe brain. Is it really bigger than those? Don't you know? Babies don't get bigger. They're start off fully-formed! The mother just needs to hug it for 9 months to make sure she has time to think about her past mistakes.

/s  An organ that has its own organs? It's organs all the way down!    </snippet></document><document><title>New found confidence in glasses!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vmpd/new_found_confidence_in_glasses/</url><snippet>Today I got new glasses that actually suit me, and as soon as I tried them on my confidence soared!

It was an extremely aggressive cancer that did not respond to chemo, metastasized to her lungs and brain, and killed her within two years. No one else in her family has ever had breast cancer, and only one distant cousin had ovarian cancer, so it came as a bit of a shock. Doctors had all sorts of theories why she got it so early and so aggressively: she had her first child after 35, she took hormonal contraceptives when she was younger, she was tall, etc. But of course, she was never tested for the BRCA gene. 

Because I have a first-degree relative who died of pre-menopausal breast cancer, my insurance will cover BRCA screening. But I'm waffling on whether or not I want to get it. I'm only 21. I know I will die someday, but I don't want to know how or when. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in fear that I will get breast cancer, or do something drastic like get a preventive double mastectomy. On the other hand, if I do have a predisposition to breast cancer, I would want to take steps to prevent it if possible. Finally, if the test comes back negative, it will be a huge weight off my shoulders.

What say you, fellow ladies? Do the benefits of getting the BRCA screening outweigh the emotional damage it may cause if it comes up positive? If I were to come up positive, what sort of steps would be taken to prevent cancer? Bottom line: Is it really worth it?      </snippet></document><document><title>Cervical cancer screening (ie pap smears) could do more harm than good for women under 25</title><url>http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid=1&amp;amp;newsstoryid=11010&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=social</url><snippet>   Better to be safe than sorry.

If screening under 25's doesn't result in any less cervical cancer diagnoses, but it does cause a significant amount of stress, anxiety and potential physical harm and negative effects on future pregnancy, then getting screened before that age does NOT constitute being more safe than sorry. It constitutes taking a huge risk with you psychological and physical health for almost zero gain. That's how medicine works.

He pap doesn't actually test for HPV, it's a different rest. They just happen to take both samples while they have the speculum in. But it's a completely unrelated test. True. It's my understanding that an abnormal pap is definitive evidence of HPV infection, but you're definitely right that it's not the same test.  Not exactly. It's strongly suggestive, but there are other things that can cause an abnormal pap. That's why people get specifically tested for HPV - you have to do a viral PCR to definitively identify it.

Just for interest, they don't test for HPV in Australia. They just do Pap smears. In the US they test for HPV because they interpret the current evidence as saying that if you have an abnormal pap, finding out if you have HPV may guide whether you need to be followed up more or less frequently. The Australians and Europeans feel there isn't sufficient evidence for that, and that testing for HPV is just unecessarily distressing people by telling them they have it.

This article critiques the U.S. because it prevents any humanitarian aid from going toward abortion - but also points out that abortion is illegal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

To make a general statement, I don't think that foreign aid should support activities that directly flout local laws.  It sets a dangerous precedent that makes it seem as if the U.S., U.K., and other global superpowers can simply come into a developing country and do whatever they like regardless of national law.

Since denying abortion to rape victims has been found to be "torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment", why are we not pursuing repeal of the Congolese laws that force this "torture" upon women in the first place?

How is facebook not listening.  [deleted] [deleted] How long ago did you report it? I just did the same and I wonder how long we'll have to wait to see if they'll do something about it.   &amp;gt; Does Facebook have a problem with women?

Doesn't everybody else? I mean, look on Reddit for christ sake! The difference, I think, is that Reddit is a site that tends to appeal more to men (unintentionally so, I suspect), and the internet as a whole tends to have more men on it. Facebook, however, advertises itself as a way to connect with people and as a way to bond online, implying that it appeals to everyone. And indeed, at least in the US, Facebook has more female users than male users.

Part of it is also that Reddit is self-policed while Facebook theoretically has a report button that goes back to some higher authority. Facebook has shareholders to consider - Reddit has only its userbase. It's easier to exclude unwanted content on Reddit because I can just not subscribe to those subreddits. On Facebook, it's a matter of what friends view, and that's much more difficult to keep in check.  You must be on a different Facebook, because I NEVER get those sort of images. The absolutely worst I've ever gotten is a lame joke about women driving.

Not to mean they don't exist, but...as with all social networks, part of it is choosing your friends well.

Yes, on one hand Facebook definitely should remove hate speech. On the other hand, there is no real reason to keep douchebags who post offensive things in your friends list. I mean seriously - do you even want to be friends with such people? I agree with the idea of defriending people who are like that, but it's still worrying that Facebook, which is essentially in control of trends to a greater or lesser extent, is censoring breastfeeding and ignoring virulent misogyny.  I think it all depends on how you see Facebook.

I see it more as an online community of people, in which I see Facebook as a means to build that community, not the community itself.

So in that sense I see it as a partly public space, in which I choose who I'll interact with. Just like in any public space I can run into unpleasant people, but I can choose not to interact with them after an initial unpleasant experience.

As for the breastfeeding pics - I have actually seen (tasteful) breastfeeding pics on Facebook. The thing is, if it's in a private album, Facebook generally will not go after it until someone reports it - and the reporting, again, is done by people from your friend list.

I have like a bunch of people who I filter from seeing my personal albums.

I agree that if in a sense you see Facebook as "the law" then they should be stricter about harmful and hateful content. I also agree Facebook seems to have a phobia of even the slightest female nudity. That should be changed, of course.

But I always want to point out to people who complain about Facebook...a lot of issues can be solved by self-regulation of just kicking toxic people off your friend list...or even just filtering them.

Facebook has no incentive to change if they aren't losing users, and they are probably gaining some from people who find  offensive jokes groups funny. If people don't actually care enough to actively leave facebook, including telling them you are leaving because you disagree with their business practices on the cancellation page, I highly doubt they are going to accomplish anything.

But actually, I disagree.

That image, and this comment, misses the point. People *like* facebook; people *like* iPhones. They *want* to continue using both. What they don't want is those corporations exploiting or hurting people in the process. It isn't about leaving those corporations; it's about changing them so that we *can* continue using them without endorsing their morally corrupt practices.  I just see it as being like that insanity saying, they keep doing the same thing and expecting something to change:

People: "We don't like this this and this, remove it! rawr rawr rawr"

Facebook: "This is our policy and we are not changing it."

People: (continued complaining without changing anything)

They tried words, now it's time for action. &amp;gt;They tried words, now it's time for action.

I agree. I just don't think leaving the site is an action that's going to change anything. It only leaves the sexists freer to be more sexist without anybody complaining.

I mean, we're all here on Reddit.... 

It's something we need to figure out in general. Facebook, Reddit, any other social networking site with rampant sexism and racism... what strategy can we take to reduce the acceptance of the sexism and racism?  I don't know, it's hard. The only thing that gets most corporations to respond is a threat to or actual loss of profits, so the only thing I can imagine even remotely working is deactivating or leaving sites that bother you with the promise to return once positive changes are made. People can continue to call them out on other media sites, or petition or email the company leadership... but I just don't see empty threats while continuing to use facebook (pageviews=adviews=continued profits) doing anything. Well if Google+ didn't suck so bad....

It isn't about leaving those corporations; it's about changing them so that we *can* continue using them without endorsing their morally corrupt practices.     Facebook is founded and run by frat boys. Facebook is founded and run by frat boys.

Did you skip over the part where they deleted a picture of a cupcake because it resembled a vulva? Or pictures of breast feeding women for goodness sake?

So, again, why delete an image of a breastfeeding when someone complains, but not an image of a battered woman that has text supporting beating women when people complain? Have you completely ignored everything I posted?  Facebook doesn't want to hire a team of censors so they can review every photo posted on Facebook to determine if it might offend somebody.  Also, there will be huge fights over what constitutes "offensive material" and "hate speech."  It may be clear to you, but other people have different beliefs than you, so nobody will ever be able to agree what is actually offensive or not.   &amp;gt;Facebook doesn't want to hire a team of censors so they can review every photo posted on Facebook to determine if it might offend somebody.

 Eichmann did :( Eichmann did :( And this is what they call cherry picking Cherry-picking can be useful when someone tells you they don't have any cherries. Picking a few choice cherries demonstrates that their claims are false.

When facebook says they don't censor images just because they might be offensive, and you find examples of them censoring images that a small minority might find offensive (even though those images don't promote violence), you've just exposed their claim as mistaken at best and a lie at worst. &amp;gt;When facebook says they don't censor images just because they might be offensive, and you find examples of them censoring images that a small minority might find offensive (even though those images don't promote violence), you've just exposed their claim as mistaken at best and a lie at worst.

Be careful with your wording, it was not deleted for being offensive. You skipped the part where they said that they delete graphic material or anything that incites violence (according to crabballs).  Breasts and vulvas are considered graphic, that's why his examples were deleted. 

This is no different than what Jezebel did with the Daily Show, creating news and controversy where there is none.


&amp;gt;Cherry-picking can be useful when someone tells you they don't have any cherries. Picking a few choice cherries demonstrates that their claims are false.

This was not that case, author picked a few cherries that looked juicy and made a conclusion based on them. Completely different. Facebook claimed that it did not censor images simply because they might be offensive. The author cited examples of facebook removing images perceived to be "graphic."

Why an image of breastfeeding is more graphic than an image of a bloodied, battered woman posted for a joke, I'm not sure. Would you be able to clarify on that point? Maybe I'm just missing something.  &amp;gt;Why an image of breastfeeding is more graphic than an image of a bloodied, battered woman posted for a joke, I'm not sure. Would you be able to clarify on that point? Maybe I'm just missing something.

See movie industry, videogames, comics. Breast or cocks are considered much more graphic and dangerous to society compared to open head wound, bloody noses.  

Again, creating artificial drama. So, when a group says, "I find this boob picture to be offensive!" Facebook agrees to take it down because American culture finds a boob to be more offensive?

But, when another group says, "This picture of a bloodied woman being shoved down a flight of stairs as part of a joke about abusing women is offensive," Facebook's thought process is, "Well, American culture doesn't find it as offensive as a boob, so we'll leave it up"?

If there are several complaints lodged against the latter, doesn't that indicate that at least a considerable minority finds the battery to be offensive enough that it should be considered graphic and inciting violence? Doesn't that mean they think that's pretty bad, even if it's not as bad as a boob?

I see exactly what you mean, for me the problem lies in their reluctance to create any distinction between material that's offensive because it contains an opinion that is controversial, and material that is graphically violent, advocates illegal activity that is violent or lethal in nature, or attempts to amuse the reader at the expense of those who have suffered as a result of these illegal activities. While I do not propose that there is an obvious line to be drawn, it seems reasonable to suppose that images of the mutilated corpses of women are more likely candidates for censorship than images of breastfeeding infants.  &amp;gt; it seems reasonable to suppose that images of the mutilated corpses of women are more likely candidates for censorship than images of breastfeeding infants.

I still don't think it's that easy.  What if a holocaust remembrance group wants to post pictures of the victims of auschwitz on facebook?  Should that picture be banned?  What if an anti-human trafficking wants to post a picture of the victims of forced prostitution?  What if an anti-war group wants to post pictures of victims of war?  All that gets banned too?  There is a distinction between material that has been disseminated for the purpose of education or information and that which this article critcises. A group for the discussion of war crimes, for example, would most likely present material in a sensitive manner, without any attempt to derive humour from the situation or set that material up as an example that others should follow.  The people complaining may not understand that nuance.  Also, do you really think Facebook wants to be in the business of deciding whether offensive material is presented in a "sensitive" manner or done tastefully?  Isn't that oftentimes very subjective and bound to offend somebody?

EDIT: Please let me know what I'm saying thats wrong instead of downvoting, thanx I understand that judgement calls are generally difficult to make and controversial, however I think that most people are able to distinguish between things which are obviously intended in a neutral sense, for example, a picture of a breast feeding mother, and things that have highly and overtly inflammatory intent, such as a picture of a mutilated corpse with a caption that suggests that the subject not only deserved a violent fate, but also that the appropriate reaction is one of amusement.

This is not just Facebook, people. If you grew up in America, and are surprised by the fact that sexual content will be censored when violent content is not you're either being willfully ignorant or have spent your life under a rock. That is how our society categorizes different levels of obscenity. Sexual obscenity is the grand poobah of "offensive" content. 

Moreover, I'm sure if you were able to provide Facebook with relevant, compelling evidence that photos of battered women *do in fact* perpetuate violence against women, they would swiftly remove such images. However, from what I can tell, the people who came from this thread to report these images gave little more than their own opinion and a heavy-handed, strongly-worded missive. 

The fact that there are people in this thread so cynical, with such a bleak opinion on the world we occupy, that they honestly believe this is a deliberate choice made on Facebook's part to allow images that *specifically* demean women really saddens me.  &amp;gt;The fact that there are people in this thread so cynical, with such a bleak opinion on the world we occupy, that they honestly believe this is a deliberate choice made on Facebook's part to allow images that specifically demean women really saddens me. 

It is a deliberate choice on their part, even if they aren't doing it with the malcious intent of, "Yeah, let's increase battery against women!" Even if their choice comes from a cultural attitude that accepts violence more than sex, why wouldn't they remove posts about rape? 

They definitely *seem* to have a bias on this issue for some reason--granted, I don't have data to see exact rates of censoring different "classes" of content. &amp;gt;It is a deliberate choice on their part

If you can prove that, it would be so damming to their product, it might even crumble. Unfortunately, you can't, so that's only speculative and putting it in such strong terms seems disingenuous at best.  They deliberately chose to refuse to remove images of violence being perpetrated against women as a part of a joke. Their argument for not taking the image down is that they don't police offensive content. The author then cited examples of them taking down other content that people reported as graphic/offensive.

They made a deliberate choice to remove one class of "offensive" image, and not the other. Again, this doesn't mean that they're cartoon-villain misogynists stroking their mustaches and cackling evilly, but they are deliberately choosing to favor the concerns over boob images while ignoring complaints about images of battering women.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you meant by "this is a deliberate choice."  &amp;gt;

But . . . FB does define what is acceptable in their TOS, and they enforce those definitions by censoring "unacceptable" things like images of women breastfeeding or of cupcakes that look like vaginas.

If they were truly hands-off and not censoring anything but the most egregious instances of inciting violence, they would not be censoring rather innocuous images like the ones above. 

The major concern here is that they won't censor images or posts that convey it's okay or funny to beat the hell out of or rape women, but they will censor images that resemble female sex organs or images of a woman breastfeeding a baby. So we should remove all posts that joke about any kind of violence, percieved inequality, inferiority, superiority, mental deficiency, etc. against any group then? The problem is that there is no end to offensive material, because anyone has the potential to be offended by the most inane content. **Don't like it? Don't use Facebook. Facebook doesn't exist to cater to peoples "feelings," it exists to make money. If it starts censoring people, it will lose more users (money) than it will by not cowtowing to the righteous idignation of a few.** &amp;gt;

It really is amazing how many redditiors seem to assume that the USA is all that is relevant.  I'd just like to point out that in the UK (this is a guardian.co.*uk* article after all), we do not have 'free speech protected by a contitution'.  It is illegal to publicly spread a message 'inciting hatred'.  


People can and do go to prison for posting offensive things on facebook here.  It is against the law.  It is also against facebook's terms of service to post such offensive messages.  It is important that they are not selectively removing some things and turning a blind eye to others, as the article seems to suggest. &amp;gt;It is not the place of public or private institutions to police offensive speech because it is protected by the constitution.

Also, the article explicitly mentioned that FB officials made a distinction between "hate speech" and "humorous speech."

And I honestly think it's sad that you can be thrown in jail for saying offensive things. That is essentially thought crime and political imprisonment.

I'm usually the first to admit the US lags behind their western counterparts, but dammit, free speech is fucking important. Once you outlaw certain kinds of speech, you make it that much easier for authoritarianism. Who's to stop the ruling party from passing legislation defining criticism of said party is "inciting hatred."

The law is dubious at best, and idiotically dangerous at worst. </snippet></document><document><title>[TMI] I'd like some opinions about what the hell is going on with my period... </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18uyuz/tmi_id_like_some_opinions_about_what_the_hell_is/</url><snippet>(this is a throwaway, btw) okay. here's the deal. I'm a 34 y.o. woman, and my period is seriously fucked up. It's super random &amp;amp; driving me insane. I'll usually only get it 2-3 times a year. I'm not on any birth control, but I do have cardiac issues. My last period was on the week between Christmas and New Years, and it was totally typical for me. Nothing crazy, only lasted about 5 days. I got it again on Saturday, and it's awful. (I told my BF last night that I felt like the elevator scene from The Shining.)

[TMI - sorry] so... it's like, chunky. Clotted blood. and it's kinda freaking me out a little. I'll be making an appointment with my doc tomorrow (they're good and can get me in ASAP if I need it) so that's all taken care of. I just wanted to see if I could get any ideas from you guys first. I'll answer any questions you guys ask.... please help?  Go to the doctor first. 99.9% of reddit can't help you. You should ask us when you've seen a medical professional and need support or real life advice on how to deal with something, not for a diagnosis.   It could just be a regular period, but if you've got massive cramps or sharp abdominal pains to go with the heavy bleeding and clots, it could be a miscarriage, especially if you're not using very reliable contraceptives or if you've had any incidents with condoms breaking or falling off or something in the last month or two. Since you have such irregular periods, ovulation is probably pretty unpredictable as well, and it's hard to tell if it would be likely for you to be pregnant now or not. 

That said, if you take frequent pregnancy tests and they've been negative, or if you take one now and it's negative, it's probably just a bad period. It could also be that you've begun developing fibroids, which I *think* are more common in older-ish women, but I'm not sure about that one. They do tend to cause hellish and heavy periods, though, and if it is one, then they can find it on an ultrasound and if they decide it's really bad they can remove it, though that's a surgery so they tend to avoid that.

In any case, you'll be fine as long as you can get in to your doctor quickly. They'll be able to figure out if something is actually wrong or if it's just a change in your cycle like many women go through every so often or even just one awful period. And it could be just an awful period. Mine used to be really heavy, and the heavier it was, the more clots there were.

Anyway, good luck and I hope it's nothing major and doesn't become a typical thing for you! Periods like that are just awful.    what does 'cardiac issues' mean?

i second the 'anovulatory cycles' theory. I was born with Tetralogy of Fallot, I've had my pulmonary valve replaced 3 times and have a pacemaker.

Rant.  [Trigger Warning]</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18tn0p/i_am_absolutely_furious_right_now_rant_trigger/</url><snippet>I just talked to my bio-dad and he told me my half sister got raped last weekend.  He is hoping I can try to talk to her.   

He told me about how her Mom tried to "helpfully" warn her about how hard things would be if she went to the police.  

He told me about how she was telling him she didn't know what she did to "deserve" it and that she didn't think she had "led him on".  

He told me about how she is worried that if she is crying too much people will think she is doing it for drama's sake and that she made it up for attention but that if she doesn't cry enough people will think she is lying and that she made it up.  

He told me that her "friend" who invited the guy over and who they think "encouraged" him to go in after her when she was drunk claims she must be lying because she didn't hear any screaming or yelling and is mad that they might get in trouble for underage drinking.  

He told me about how a friend of his asked to talk to her because the friend had a similar experience and then when she went to talk to her the friend just unloaded all over her with her own issues.  

I am fucking furious that these are the things women have to go through when they experience rape.  I am fucking furious that girls end up feeling embarrassed when they should be righteously angry.  I am furious that she is being treated this way by the people who should be supporting her.  

Okay...rant over.  I just needed to vent before I have to focus on work for the rest of the day.  Thank God she has you for a sister, half or otherwise.     I might be off my rocket here, and downvotes for my opinion may happen, and that's ok.  I'm not exactly sure what your mother's intentions were in trying to warn her about how "hard things would be if she went to the police" as you said.  But it is possible that she didn't mean anything harmful by it.  I'm not sure.

In all reality, it is HARD.  You have to let people physically examine you, you have to tell your story countless of times to different people, and once again in court, in front of a judge, in front of your attacker, and defend your story against a defense lawyer, who WILL try to trip you up with your story, make you seem like you are lying, like you wanted it, and how it's not your attackers fault.  And then, leave it up to interpretation to other people to find this person guilty, or not.  

I mean, it is 100% absolutely terrifying and difficult thing to do.  Should every woman "ought" to report and try to persecute their attackers?  It's noble, in a sense, to say YES.  Every woman should.

But who are we to DEMAND that every woman should do this?  Of course, we mean well, and we don't want this to happen again to anyone, but it is NOT our cross to bear.  It is the victim's cross and decision to take.  At the end of the day, we simply HAVE to be supportive of our loved ones choices.  I applaud women who take on the system head on, but I certainly cannot shame anyone who chooses not to.  

Anyhow, I hope that in the end, everyone in your family can agree to be supportive and most of all SENSITIVE towards the situation.  We just can't tell people what to do, or not do. Just to clear up, because I think there may have been a misconception, no one is forcing her to either report or not report.  She wanted to report it and has already done so.  I hope my rant didn't come across as an attempt by me or anyone else to force her to report something she wasn't comfortable with.  

Her mom definitely did not mean anything harmful by it.  She was attempting to be helpful and to be honest and upfront about exactly the issues you are bringing up here.  But at that point, my sister was telling her what she wanted to do (go to the police) and what she heard her mom telling her was that she shouldn't do it because it will be difficult and she might get in trouble for underage drinking.   

I definitely feel that women have the right to make their own choice about reporting.  I am personally in favor of reporting, but you are right.  I don't get to demand it.  However, it is absolute bullshit when someone is pushed to *not* report because "it will make you look bad" or "it is just your word" or "they probably won't believe you" or "you shouldn't have gotten yourself in that position in the first place".  

So, no one is forcing her to do anything.  She wanted to report it and she did.  That's fucking absurd. I'd talk to her and get her to fucking prosecute the guy. That is bullshit.     Why don't you do something about it?  Reach out to your half-sister and help her out.  If you can't translate your anger into action, then its wasted. 

EDIT: Really?  This gets downvoted?   Correct your dad. ....meaning what? I'm an idiot and misread what you wrote, correct her mom. 

Jesus, I'm sorry.</snippet></document></searchresult>
