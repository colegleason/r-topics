Drivers are written against a kernel, and can be reproduced across different platforms. A kernel's specific interface can be reproduced/ported/compiled across different CPU platforms/ instruction sets. The low-level pieces of an operating system are compiled against that kernel's interface, and higher-level applications are then built against the operating system, roughly speaking. In short, the kernel is concerned mainly with managing the CPU and RAM, and some of the input/output busses that other hardware connect to, but drivers are more concerned with how that other hardware works than the kernel.\n\nStandards play a huge role in hardware compatibility.

A program written in C could THEORETICALLY be compiled to any hardware platform/instruction set - assuming a compiler existed for that platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kernels act as a middle-man to abstract away some of the inner-workings of the cpu and memory, and provide basic services for programs so that programs don&amp;#39;t have to worry about the complex innerworkings (and the even greater complexity of sharing and managing those inner resources between each other).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose of drivers is similar to a kernel - it abstracts away the inner-workings of the hardware attachments so a program (and its developer) can worry only about the interface to that hardware. Drivers are written against a kernel, and can be reproduced across different platforms. A kernel&amp;#39;s specific interface can be reproduced/ported/compiled across different CPU platforms/ instruction sets. The low-level pieces of an operating system are compiled against that kernel&amp;#39;s interface, and higher-level applications are then built against the operating system, roughly speaking. In short, the kernel is concerned mainly with managing the CPU and RAM, and some of the input/output busses that other hardware connect to, but drivers are more concerned with how that other hardware works than the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standards play a huge role in hardware compatibility. This is why you have different versions of say, Debian, for i686, x86_64, and ARM - these are different standards of CPU instruction sets, effectively. As time goes on, for one reason or another, particular standards emerge as dominant. In the meantime, new technologies act as middle-men between programs and OS, between OS and hardware, etc. For instance the Java Virtual Machine is compiled against many OS&amp;#39;s and hardware, but provides a universal common interface for java code to run in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8hhtye", "flair_text": null, "created": 1361260763.0, "created_utc": 1361231963.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_18s1s1", "children": [], "author": "Geohump", "id": "c8hhw4n", "parent_id": "t3_18s1s1", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "abstraction. design an API layer which has calls to perform all the basic functions for a given type of device.  then implement a device driver for each specific device, as the other half of that API set. \n\nThink about it. a basic hard drive has two main functions, Write Buffer at Address X, and Read Buffer at address X\n\nNow extrapolate that concept", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;abstraction. design an API layer which has calls to perform all the basic functions for a given type of device.  then implement a device driver for each specific device, as the other half of that API set. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it. a basic hard drive has two main functions, Write Buffer at Address X, and Read Buffer at address X&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now extrapolate that concept&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8hhw4n", "flair_text": null, "created": 1361260971.0, "created_utc": 1361232171.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_18s1s1", "children": [], "author": "PubliusPontifex", "id": "c8hiag7", "parent_id": "t3_18s1s1", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "Abstraction.

The stuff that operates on those things, that&amp;#39;s your code. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Data&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Code&amp;quot; are generally considered the two parts of a program (and, in fact, in some programming languages they are actually split in the program. ie. you have a data section and a code section). Without code, the data is just pieces of information stored somewhere in some way. Without data, the code is just a set of instructions that has nothing to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8h7307", "flair_text": null, "created": 1361226215.0, "created_utc": 1361197415.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qqqc", "children": [], "author": "spevak", "id": "c8h628g", "parent_id": "t3_18qqqc", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 5, "body": "I think what you're asking is a very general question about a subject complicated enough to merit an entire field of study (i.e. [information theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory)).

If you're into set theory, you should read Sipser's [An Introduction to the Theory of Computation](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Sipser-Edition/dp/B003NI4ZPM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361159135&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+the+theory+of+computation) (you can probably find it in your library... the first edition is something like $25 used on Amazon), followed by [Arora-Barak](http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Complexity-Approach-Sanjeev-Arora/dp/0521424267/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361159227&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=arora+barak) for which this is a [freely-available draft](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/) (unfortunately, the draft doesn't contain the figures, which are oftentimes helpful). You could, in theory, skip directly into the latter, but working through Sipser first will much better fuel your intuition.\n\nAnother thing to look into is Algorithm design, in which case I recommend checking out the book titled [Algorithms](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. It's a really nice introduction to algorithms that doesn't shy away from formality. Eventually, you'll want to transition to something more advanced like [CLRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) or [Kleinberg-Tardos](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358), but DPV itself is a wonderful (and free) starting point.\n\nCrypto, as someone else mentioned, is also a very nice field to look into, but I wouldn't recommend going into it before at least working through DPV up through the NP-completeness chapter.\n\nIf you're into math, I'd recommend not wasting your time with studying individual programming languages. [Once you learn one, you effectively learn them all](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_Hypothesis) (perhaps modulo some small changes that come with different paradigms... but nothing truly substantial). Also, to be frank, I'm not really impressed by the math involved in many of these programming language books (such as the one linked to by dmwit). The types of proofs mentioned there are, at best, at the level of a 11th grader who passed a basic course in Euclidean geometry and Algebra 2. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious with these books, but I can't imagine anyone who has taken a legitimate Analysis or (abstract) Algebra class considering these proofs to be anything but trivial.\n\nBy the way, if you end up running into any roadblocks in any of these books (including the PL book... I guess...), feel free to PM me. I'm generally addicted to helping people who want to learn, and I promise to do what I can.\n\nEdit: Some other notes on the comments here:\n\n1. GEB is a waste of time. It's intended for an audience much less mathematically inclined than math majors. Please don't waste your time with it. If you want to learn about Godel's theorem, Ernest Nagel has [a decent book](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6dels-Proof-Ernest-Nagel/dp/0814758371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361160958&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=godel%27s+theorem+nagel) you could use instead.\n2. Knuth is probably a good book, but I'm willing to put down $100 that whoever recommends it to you hasn't actually read much of it.

AI might be a fun topic, though again I'd recommend reading up on it *after* going through DPV.  It's mathematically lighter than, say, Arora-Barak, but it's perhaps more practical. Russell-Norvig is considered the standard intro tome, and is [effectively free used on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0131038052/ref=sr_1_2_olp?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361160736&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=russell+norvig&amp;condition=used).\n4. Quantum complexity would require a large degree of familiarity with linear algebra, and I can't quite recommend going for it without at least some background in classical complexity. Nonetheless, Fields Medalist Tim Gowers has [a nice set of talks available online](http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/545358) on the subject if you're up for the task. I imagine it would be rather tricky to use this as a starting point, but if I recall correctly he doesn't assume *that* much background knowledge in algorithms (it's been about 4 years since I watched the thing, so I could be misremembering).", "edited": 1361308433.0, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former math undergrad here. If you&amp;#39;re into set theory, you should read Sipser&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Sipser-Edition/dp/B003NI4ZPM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361159135&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=an+introduction+to+the+theory+of+computation\"&gt;An Introduction to the Theory of Computation&lt;/a&gt; (you can probably find it in your library... the first edition is something like $25 used on Amazon), followed by &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Complexity-Approach-Sanjeev-Arora/dp/0521424267/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361159227&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=arora+barak\"&gt;Arora-Barak&lt;/a&gt; for which this is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/\"&gt;freely-available draft&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately, the draft doesn&amp;#39;t contain the figures, which are oftentimes helpful). You could, in theory, skip directly into the latter, but working through Sipser first will much better fuel your intuition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing to look into is Algorithm design, in which case I recommend checking out the book titled &lt;a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Evazirani/algorithms.html\"&gt;Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani. It&amp;#39;s a really nice introduction to algorithms that doesn&amp;#39;t shy away from formality. Eventually, you&amp;#39;ll want to transition to something more advanced like &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms\"&gt;CLRS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358\"&gt;Kleinberg-Tardos&lt;/a&gt;, but DPV itself is a wonderful (and free) starting point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto, as someone else mentioned, is also a very nice field to look into, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend going into it before at least working through DPV up through the NP-completeness chapter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re into math, I&amp;#39;d recommend not wasting your time with studying individual programming languages. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_Hypothesis\"&gt;Once you learn one, you effectively learn them all&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps modulo some small changes that come with different paradigms... but nothing truly substantial). Also, to be frank, I&amp;#39;m not really impressed by the math involved in many of these programming language books (such as the one linked to by dmwit). The types of proofs mentioned there are, at best, at the level of a 11th grader who passed a basic course in Euclidean geometry and Algebra 2. Perhaps I&amp;#39;m missing something obvious with these books, but I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone who has taken a legitimate Analysis or (abstract) Algebra class considering these proofs to be anything but trivial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you end up running into any roadblocks in any of these books (including the PL book... I guess...), feel free to PM me. I&amp;#39;m generally addicted to helping people who want to learn, and I promise to do what I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some other notes on the comments here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GEB is a waste of time. It&amp;#39;s intended for an audience much less mathematically inclined than math majors. Please don&amp;#39;t waste your time with it. If you want to learn about Godel&amp;#39;s theorem, Ernest Nagel has &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6dels-Proof-Ernest-Nagel/dp/0814758371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1361160958&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=godel%27s+theorem+nagel\"&gt;a decent book&lt;/a&gt; you could use instead.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knuth is probably a good book, but I&amp;#39;m willing to put down $100 that whoever recommends it to you hasn&amp;#39;t actually read much of it.

I've just found this new book [Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and all that Jazz](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Database-Design-Relational-Theory-Normal/dp/1449328016/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360797388&amp;sr=8-2). It also comes with a corresponding 10 hour master class, available on [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025900.do).\n\nTo answer your question, just like everyone else said - it depends. I personally go with natural keys wherever possible because:\n\n* I work in environments that do not need optimal write performance\n* I find it more intuitive\n* I find it easier to reason about\n* It forces me to think about what constitutes a duplicate row up front. Even if you use a surrogate key this is *essential* for good database design!\n* Less indexes to maintain (you'll need a unique index alongside the surrogate key anyway)\n* Join data for freeee! For example, rather than joining on `country_id` against `country` to get an `iso_code`, I might just use `country_iso` as my FK - which often does the job just fine.\n* A similar point to the above is that it can make debugging easier. Rather than having to laboriously join stuff just to check some assumptions I'm making are correct, I can often just eyeball the data.\n\nA lot of these are very subjective, but most modern database's don't really make either advantageous in their own right (or more, there is no silver bullet). Do your research, understand the problem domain, and worry about the rest of your model first.\n\nPeople keep saying \"oh noes, SSN isn't unique!\" Great, it's not, but throwing a surrogate ID on there hasn't solved your problems, unless your only problem was that you needed to use it in a FK, which I highly doubt. If you don't have an answer to \"what constitutes a unique row\" you should really take a step back and work out what, in the domain of the problem you're actually trying to solve (that is, your application), constitutes a uniqueness.", "edited": 1360801057.0, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been discussed heavily.

I&amp;#39;ve just found this new book &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Database-Design-Relational-Theory-Normal/dp/1449328016/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1360797388&amp;amp;sr=8-2\"&gt;Database Design and Relational Theory: Normal Forms and all that Jazz&lt;/a&gt;.

I personally go with natural keys wherever possible because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I work in environments that do not need optimal write performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I find it more intuitive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I find it easier to reason about&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It forces me to think about what constitutes a duplicate row up front. Even if you use a surrogate key this is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; for good database design!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Less indexes to maintain (you&amp;#39;ll need a unique index alongside the surrogate key anyway)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Join data for freeee! For example, rather than joining on &lt;code&gt;country_id&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;country&lt;/code&gt; to get an &lt;code&gt;iso_code&lt;/code&gt;, I might just use &lt;code&gt;country_iso&lt;/code&gt; as my FK - which often does the job just fine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A similar point to the above is that it can make debugging easier. Rather than having to laboriously join stuff just to check some assumptions I&amp;#39;m making are correct, I can often just eyeball the data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of these are very subjective, but most modern database&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t really make either advantageous in their own right (or more, there is no silver bullet). Do your research, understand the problem domain, and worry about the rest of your model first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People keep saying &amp;quot;oh noes, SSN isn&amp;#39;t unique!&amp;quot; Great, it&amp;#39;s not, but throwing a surrogate ID on there hasn&amp;#39;t solved your problems, unless your only problem was that you needed to use it in a FK, which I highly doubt. If you don&amp;#39;t have an answer to &amp;quot;what constitutes a unique row&amp;quot; you should really take a step back and work out what, in the domain of the problem you&amp;#39;re actually trying to solve (that is, your application), constitutes a uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8erk45", "flair_text": null, "created": 1360826558.0, "created_utc": 1360797758.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_18gvkl", "children": [], "author": "AdamAnderson320", "id": "c8errs0", "parent_id": "t3_18gvkl", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 17, "body": "DB application developer with 17 years experience here.\n\nI find that academics tend to advocate natural keys, and professional developers tend to use surrogate keys.

I have worked with DB for about 15 years. I have used both concepts, &amp; sometimes, one its better than other, and viceversa.\n\nLet me remark, that there are two ways to work with surrogate keys.\n\n(1) One way is that when you add a record to a table, the database server generate the key value (like autoincrement fields)...\n\n(2) ... and another, that your application generate, automatically, the key value, and send it, with the rest of the fields.\n\nI have trouble with several databases that generate their own fields like autoincrement fields, due to several problems, like the database generate a duplicated key, specially if people work with paralell programming, concurrent programming, several sever cores, several CPU's.\n\nI suggest that when choosing a surrogate key, generate the key automatically from the application, using a good method, for example, Universal Unique Identifiers.\n\nAnother way, its to have a table that stores an integer key for each table, and each time the value its read it, the value its incremented, even if its not used.\n\nNatural Keys, are better when using common data, that requires to be easy identified. Imagine you have a e-store, and you sell products, and you have to store the country where the delivery is made.\n\nInstead of making a new table with new surrogate autoincrement keys, \nfor each country, you could use the \"2\" or \"3\" letter standard for Internet countries, (\"us\" for U.S., \"ca\" for Canada).\n\n(3) Another important thing to consider, in natural keys, is that there exist also 2 ways to handle them. Single Fields, like U.S. Security Numbers, and multiple key, a.k.a. \"Composite Key\".\n\nComposite Keys, can be used, but, sometimes, it can be difficult to handle. \n\nIts common to design a header / parent table (\"SaleHeader\", \"Products\"), with their own single key field, and a detail / child table (\"SalesProducts\"), with a key field composed by the header composed by parent keys (\"SalesHeader_Key\", \"Product_Key\"), &amp; a consecutive number for each product.\n\nBut, if you need to replace the parent key, in case of an error, or want to check all fields, it can be boring. Composite Keys are also slow to read in a query, and some database severs, doesn't even support it.\n\nCheers.\n\nTL;DR There is not perfect solution, but, Natural are better for short tables, commonly used data, surrogate for big tables.

I have used both concepts, &amp;amp; sometimes, one its better than other, and viceversa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me remark, that there are two ways to work with surrogate keys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) One way is that when you add a record to a table, the database server generate the key value (like autoincrement fields)...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) ... and another, that your application generate, automatically, the key value, and send it, with the rest of the fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have trouble with several databases that generate their own fields like autoincrement fields, due to several problems, like the database generate a duplicated key, specially if people work with paralell programming, concurrent programming, several sever cores, several CPU&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest that when choosing a surrogate key, generate the key automatically from the application, using a good method, for example, Universal Unique Identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another way, its to have a table that stores an integer key for each table, and each time the value its read it, the value its incremented, even if its not used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Natural Keys, are better when using common data, that requires to be easy identified. Imagine you have a e-store, and you sell products, and you have to store the country where the delivery is made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a new table with new surrogate autoincrement keys, \nfor each country, you could use the &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; letter standard for Internet countries, (&amp;quot;us&amp;quot; for U.S., &amp;quot;ca&amp;quot; for Canada).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Another important thing to consider, in natural keys, is that there exist also 2 ways to handle them. Single Fields, like U.S. Security Numbers, and multiple key, a.k.a. &amp;quot;Composite Key&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Composite Keys, can be used, but, sometimes, it can be difficult to handle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its common to design a header / parent table (&amp;quot;SaleHeader&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Products&amp;quot;), with their own single key field, and a detail / child table (&amp;quot;SalesProducts&amp;quot;), with a key field composed by the header composed by parent keys (&amp;quot;SalesHeader_Key&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Product_Key&amp;quot;), &amp;amp; a consecutive number for each product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you need to replace the parent key, in case of an error, or want to check all fields, it can be boring. Composite Keys are also slow to read in a query, and some database severs, doesn&amp;#39;t even support it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR There is not perfect solution, but, Natural are better for short tables, commonly used data, surrogate for big tables.

Gordon makes the claim that a GADDAG is twice as fast as a DAWG (basically a Trie) for word generation.\n\nBasically, a GADDAG is a graph-like structure that contains all of the REV(x)|y paths for every word in a lexicon, where '|' is a delimiter. So, for example, the GADDAG for the word 'care' would contain the path 'ERAC|', 'RAC|E', 'AC|RE', and 'C|ARE'. To construct a word, traverse the structure until you hit a delimiter, reverse whatever you have at that point, then append the suffix.\n\nThe advantage of a GADDAG is that it eliminates a lot the non-determinism when searching for words without a known prefix. If you want the list of all words that have 'I' as the second position, then you start by traversing the arc from the root node to the 'I' state, and visiting all paths that have the delimiter 2 positions away from the 'I' state. There's still some non-determinism when searching, but it's far more efficient than a Trie.\n\nGordon actually gives an algorithm for Scrabble move generation in the paper in pseudocode, which you could easily apply to a crossword solver. He also presents an algorithm for partially-minimized construction of a GADDAG from a lexicon.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that even a partially-minimized GADDAG is larger than a Trie would be for the same lexicon.

If you want the list of all words that have &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; as the second position, then you start by traversing the arc from the root node to the &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; state, and visiting all paths that have the delimiter 2 positions away from the &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; state. There&amp;#39;s still some non-determinism when searching, but it&amp;#39;s far more efficient than a Trie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gordon actually gives an algorithm for Scrabble move generation in the paper in pseudocode, which you could easily apply to a crossword solver. He also presents an algorithm for partially-minimized construction of a GADDAG from a lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that even a partially-minimized GADDAG is larger than a Trie would be for the same lexicon. For example, OSPD4 is about 300MB in RAM in a Trie and 500MB in a GADDAG.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8bsnty", "flair_text": null, "created": 1360387176.0, "created_utc": 1360358376.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_1856zv", "children": [], "author": "perspichaos", "id": "c8bpg9z", "parent_id": "t3_1856zv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 11, "body": "I would think a modified Trie with each level of the trie connected by linked list.

I think so.&lt;/del&gt; Average size n/26.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This solution requires O(nl) space, and requires the intersection of k O(n)-element sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: I suck at math.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8bt5p2", "flair_text": null, "created": 1360388666.0, "created_utc": 1360359866.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_1856zv", "children": [], "author": "crundar", "id": "c8c0ah1", "parent_id": "t3_1856zv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "Have you looked at the declarative implementation?
