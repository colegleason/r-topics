The reforms further define and\u00a0strengthen\u00a0the roles of the Inspector General, Legislative Inspector General, and Board of Ethics. The ordinance also\u00a0prohibits lobbying by former aldermen for a year after they leave office.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I voted for the ordinance, but I believe it should have gone further. The ordinance originally proposed by the administration included provisions to allow\u00a0anonymous ethics complaints against aldermen. Such complaints are already allowed against city employees.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the anonymous provisions were stricken from the ordinance, it is an improvement. I will continue to support any changes that help\u00a0strengthen ethics and restore trust in city government.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same city council meeting, I introduced a resolution calling for hearings into the site selection process for red light cameras. 23 other aldermen signed onto the resolution.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original intent of the cameras was to improve traffic safety, and I support that goal. However, recent allegations of unethical behavior by the program vendor make me concerned that camera sites were selected based on how much revenue they would generate, not how much safer that would make our roads.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The resolution asks that Chicago Department of Transportation officials be prepared to discuss how sites are selected,\u00a0who takes part in making those decisions, and\u00a0what data is examined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we&amp;#39;ll get some answer so that we can ensure that this tool makes our roads safer and isn&amp;#39;t used simply to generate revenue.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks\nI want to thank\u00a0the students from Schurz High School who took time out of their day off school Tuesday to show almost 200 seniors a good time during my Senior Valentine&amp;#39;s Dance.
