Ted promises the others he will give them a signal that it&amp;#39;s okay to leave by calling them and letting the phone ring once. In the apartment Robin says line after line that makes Ted pull out the phone, then put it away, then pull it out, and put it away as he anticipates the possibility of an overnight stay.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When Robin and Ted talk on the couch after he admits he loves her, she admits she would have slept with him if he hadn&amp;#39;t said that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lily and Marshall buy champagne while waiting for Ted to get out of Robin&amp;#39;s apartment. They are happy because the cap is a twist-off. They end up getting arrested. Barney just sits there and watches.

Other interesting notes for those who don't want to read the entire thing:\n\n* Marshall had a thing where he would diagnose himself with ridiculous diseases (farfetched things even for HIMYM) for the smallest symptom. His character also comes off as a lot wimpier than Segel's eventual portrayal.\n* Ted is WAY creepier when he talks to the Lebanese girl about how planned out his future is.\n* They overdo the pirate references for Lily's eye patch. \n* One of the funnier cut scenes took place right when the group drops Ted off at Robin's place after he steals the blue horn. Ted promises the others he will give them a signal that it's okay to leave by calling them and letting the phone ring once.

If you're unfamiliar with Bump Girl, she was the red herring in the episode No Tomorrow in which Ted claims that the mother was at that St. Patrick's Day party.  The fan theory about Bump Girl is essentially that Ted only met 2 girls at that party, one of whom he shared drinks with, the other of whom he bumped into, and so therefore she might possibly be Bump Girl.\n\nThen if we jump to the episode Band or DJ?, we learn that Ted's ex-girlfriend Cindy's former room mate (AKA the person who is definitely the mother) is in a band that does weddings, which is of course the band that performs at Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\nMy hypothesis is this: what if Bump Girl is in the band along with the mother?  If there are multiple women in the band, why couldn't one of them be Bump Girl?  What if Bump Girl, the mother, and Cindy are all friends (and hell, maybe even Stella is one of their friends too which would explain how she was at that bar on St. Patrick's Day as well)?  Further, what if the producers of the show placed the footage of Bump Girl into tonight's episode specifically to give us 1 last red herring in this season's finale?  Bump Girl could be a girl in the band that Ted meets at the wedding (though he has as almost no memory of meeting her prior on St. Patrick's Day) and he could meet her minutes before he meets the mother.  I'm not saying he would date Bump Girl or anything because we know that's not possible because of his explanation tonight that Jeanette was his last girlfriend before he's ready to settle down.\n\nI would be extremely happy if this season ends with Bump Girl as the one that Ted is supposedly looking at only to have her be revealed to be an impossible option for the mother.  Then Ted looks over at the bass player and they echo the same ending sequence from Band or DJ? before rolling the credits.  This would indicate that the very beginning of next season will reveal who the mother is while leaving us desperately wondering who she is all summer.  And don't think they won't split up a scene at a wedding around one season ending and another one beginning -- they did it at the end of season 2 into season 3.

I started reaching out to old friends and started being more social with people in class and out at bars and clubs downtown. I stopped playing so many video games. I started getting better grades, diving into a new major (psychology). I picked up things that I hadn't done in a while, like kendo and soccer. I became more fashion-conscious, and I started talking to more girls. The confidence shift that I experienced was incredible, and remembering the kind of fucked but awesome advice of Barney helped me find that.\n\nI met two girls over the course of those six months and re-established ties with an old friend from high school - two were one-night stands (but the kind where we keep talking from time to time on Facebook).

Time heals all wounds and such, but seeing Ted struggle for true love is what, in conjunction with the 'time healing all wounds' stuff, inspired me to start giving it another go, even if I'm still worried about experiencing that kind of heartbreak again.\n\nThe third girl, the old friend from high school, we kind of had drunk sex on new years eve, but when we woke up we didn't regret a damn thing. As of right now, we're not official in the slightest, but we still enjoy each other's company. It's one of those weird things - we talked about it, and we're both worried that if we try something more 'real' we could eventually not even be friends anymore. The way we act, though? You'd think we were together. So even if she isn't the one, she still helps me feel that way, you know? But we've made it clear that if we find someone else to go for it, and that we'd think about becoming official as time went on. It may sound weird, but it makes me happy.

To me, the show does a really good job of featuring both realistic things as well as idealistic things. The show taught me you should take the leap, that somehow you will be in the right place in the right time, that sometimes you end up a doppleganger to who you once were, that there are times when you think you are okay in life but you are really crooked, that it&amp;#39;s all leading somewhere for us, that it is possible to be on someone&amp;#39;s hook and to have someone on your own hook and to let them go, that last words are important, and so many other lessons. Honestly, HIMYM is one of my favorite shows because of the lasting impact it&amp;#39;s had on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c86z23n", "flair_text": null, "created": 1359653531.0, "created_utc": 1359653531.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcqy", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_17mlx9", "children": [], "author": "tryst187", "id": "c876wsc", "parent_id": "t3_17mlx9", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "I keep watching and love the show because it is the perfect love story about how even though Ted had so many women he remembers every detail to the T and found his one true love.

I would love to see some more Robin/ Barney character development in upcoming episodes. I agree the lightheartedness of the show is great and funny! But this episode was crap. A good episode should be funny, i agree, but that&amp;#39;s not the way they executed it in this episode. I have loved the last two though. Band or DJ? was great and then there was the final page.... I would love to see Bays and Thomas roll out some more episodes like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c83zrv9", "flair_text": null, "created": 1359224805.0, "created_utc": 1359221205.0, "num_reports": null}], "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "author_flair_class": null, "upvotes": 11, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "modhash": "9yxf86h41v13442dab78689f7139500ce5980934eefc552954", "media_embed": {}, "more_comments": "", "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/HIMYM/comments/17atbr/hey_guys_i_might_be_a_little_late_but_did_anybody/", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t3_17atbr", "created": 1359203274.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/17atbr/hey_guys_i_might_be_a_little_late_but_did_anybody/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "weiss321", "created_utc": 1359174474.0, "link_flair_text": null, "media": null, "num_reports": null}, "535": {"domain": "self.HIMYM", "link_flair_class": null, "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 5, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rcqy", "subreddit": "HIMYM", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I saw a picture here a while ago, I can&amp;#39;t remember or seem to be able to find the said image.
