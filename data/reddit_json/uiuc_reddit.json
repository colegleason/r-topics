After that you have 225 (which I didn't take) and 325, which are more difficult and bear a much greater semblance of what your actual courses look like.

If you do well in your classes, chances are you'll get into most grad schools without a problem, considering the ranking of this physics program. \n\nI've compared this school's physics curriculum to others, and I've noticed that it is much more heavy on the theory side than experimental, so that's something to keep in mind, as well.  As far as specialization goes, I'd worry more about that if you decide to go to grad school, although if you're applying to a more competitive program, it can definitely help as part of undergraduate experience.\n\nAm I worried that I won't find a job?

Here are some answers to the other questions:\n\n* What is the deal with the low ABV beers?\n\nAs someone else already mentioned, ABV doesn't really correspond to flavor. Our tasting room is meant to be a place you can hang out for a while, play a game of chess/cribbage/cards/whatever, and since it is the middle of winter and a little bit off the beaten path, I thought it might be nice to have some beers that you can enjoy quite a lot of without getting hammered. I did this with mostly British styles, following the tradition of a British \"session\", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking Also, I knew a lot of our initial visitors would be our Kickstarter supporters, many of whom were friends and family that while they appreciate our dream, they aren't quite craft beer enthusiasts yet, and so I wanted to have a range that they could enjoy as well.\n\n* Perhaps super high alcohol beers take longer to brew?\n\nThe time difference is pretty negligible, the answer is pretty much the same. I wanted to encourage some social session engagement without making it impossible for people to get back home after an evening at the tasting room. When spring and summer start rolling around and it becomes biking weather, I'll put some more higher abv beers on.\n\n* Growlers\n\nFills are currently between $14-16. And until March 2nd, we're participating in a food drive so if you bring in a non-perishable canned good, we're taking a buck off a growler fill. We sell growlers but we are also happy to fill ANYONE ELSE's 64oz growler too.\n\n* Future beers\n\nI have a significant stable of beer recipes; the idea is that every couple of weeks there is something new on tap at the tasting room. Immediately coming up we have an Imperial IPA and an English Pale ale. Following that will be a number of German lagers. We also have a couple of beers aging in Buffalo Trace Bourbon barrels.\n\nI hope folks will give us a chance. I think our prices are competitive with craft offerings you find elsewhere and as someone else mentioned, we've tried to set up a space/place/brewery that is pretty much all about beer.", "edited": 1361290569.0, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t hit reddit often but when someone mentioned this thread in the tasting room last night, I thought I would bite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the head brewer at Triptych, one of the three owners, and I suppose you can ask me anything. Here are some answers to the other questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the deal with the low ABV beers?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone else already mentioned, ABV doesn&amp;#39;t really correspond to flavor. Our tasting room is meant to be a place you can hang out for a while, play a game of chess/cribbage/cards/whatever, and since it is the middle of winter and a little bit off the beaten path, I thought it might be nice to have some beers that you can enjoy quite a lot of without getting hammered. I did this with mostly British styles, following the tradition of a British &amp;quot;session&amp;quot;, see &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking\"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking&lt;/a&gt; Also, I knew a lot of our initial visitors would be our Kickstarter supporters, many of whom were friends and family that while they appreciate our dream, they aren&amp;#39;t quite craft beer enthusiasts yet, and so I wanted to have a range that they could enjoy as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perhaps super high alcohol beers take longer to brew?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time difference is pretty negligible, the answer is pretty much the same. I wanted to encourage some social session engagement without making it impossible for people to get back home after an evening at the tasting room. When spring and summer start rolling around and it becomes biking weather, I&amp;#39;ll put some more higher abv beers on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Growlers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fills are currently between $14-16. And until March 2nd, we&amp;#39;re participating in a food drive so if you bring in a non-perishable canned good, we&amp;#39;re taking a buck off a growler fill. We sell growlers but we are also happy to fill ANYONE ELSE&amp;#39;s 64oz growler too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Future beers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a significant stable of beer recipes; the idea is that every couple of weeks there is something new on tap at the tasting room. Immediately coming up we have an Imperial IPA and an English Pale ale. Following that will be a number of German lagers.

Good job.  The ISS, again, passes a resolution akin to \"The sun should rise tomorrow\".\n\n&gt;Many students, despite our efforts, still don\u2019t know who we are or how we can help them.

We've heard of the ISS (lord knows we see enough sidewalk chalk), but as long as it keeps its hands out of our pockets to do nothing and play the silly resume fluff game, we don't care.\n\n\n&gt;we avoided a possible split from the graduate delegation through committee reconstruction.\n\nDon't care.  again, stupid internal games.\n\n&gt;Although some senators may disagree with our spending, they are hypocritical in doing so.
