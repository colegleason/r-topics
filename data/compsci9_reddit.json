But these languages were just tools for us and we didn't study them in-depth.\n\n He mentioned something about interpretive languages vs. compiled languages, but I'm not sure what he meant by that. He also asked us to look up \"JIT\" for MATLAB and start from there but I don't quite understand the whole compilation deal.\n\nSo, why is MATLAB inefficient in doing such simple computations? I am assuming that it is rather efficient in doing matrix algebra compared to C/C++.\n\nThank you for your help, in advance and this is not a real priority since we are taking a math class.

Somehow, they determine that the algorithms that took years of research by the NSA are either too complicated or too insecure and write their own, which ends up being a trillion times less secure.  I've seen people \"encrypt\" credentials in JavaScript, which makes no sense as SSL will do it for you, and every week there's a new database of passwords stolen from some company who didn't hash their passwords or didn't salt their hashes, which I'm sure you've heard about.\n\nThen there's the people who build rube-goldberg solutions.  One of my favorites was probably the time that my coworker was trying to troubleshoot an issue with a document upload timing out.  She spent a few hours just looking at it, and then calls me.  I look at it and immediately see the problem.  Someone built it so that it:\n\n1.  Reads the document\n2.  Opens the database table with documents\n3.  Reads the entire table of documents into memory locking the entire table from other users.  Now there's several thousand documents at this point, and it's reading over the network.\n4.  Adds a new record to the in memory table\n5.  Stores the new document in the record\n6.  Write the whole several hundred megabyte thing back to the database across the network.\n\nShe did not accept my recommendation to remove the \"read entire 700MB table into memory\" step.\n\nThen there's the C# coder who would read absolutely everything into a \"DataSet\" object to pass between method calls.  UGh.\n\nXML is probably one of the biggest crackpot computer science ideas ever.\n\nThere's people who do make debugging as hard as possible by doing try/catch everything blocks around every single function, essentially suppressing every single error.  Had one application, where the users didn't even know it wasn't working, they did data entry on this app for a year, and lost every bit of it because the developer used this pikachu (gotta catch em all!) exception handling, and always displayed a popup box saying that it saved successfully despite that it didn't.  Ended up ripping most of them out, and the users blamed me for breaking it, because errors would occur constantly, despite that I spend three weeks fixing everything I could find myself.  Of course, there where no unit tests.\n\nAlso: the guy my boss hired who couldn't build a SQL statement.

I&amp;#39;ve seen people &amp;quot;encrypt&amp;quot; credentials in JavaScript, which makes no sense as SSL will do it for you, and every week there&amp;#39;s a new database of passwords stolen from some company who didn&amp;#39;t hash their passwords or didn&amp;#39;t salt their hashes, which I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve heard about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the people who build rube-goldberg solutions.  One of my favorites was probably the time that my coworker was trying to troubleshoot an issue with a document upload timing out.  She spent a few hours just looking at it, and then calls me.  I look at it and immediately see the problem.  Someone built it so that it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Reads the document&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Opens the database table with documents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Reads the entire table of documents into memory locking the entire table from other users.  Now there&amp;#39;s several thousand documents at this point, and it&amp;#39;s reading over the network.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Adds a new record to the in memory table&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Stores the new document in the record&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Write the whole several hundred megabyte thing back to the database across the network.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did not accept my recommendation to remove the &amp;quot;read entire 700MB table into memory&amp;quot; step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the C# coder who would read absolutely everything into a &amp;quot;DataSet&amp;quot; object to pass between method calls.  UGh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;XML is probably one of the biggest crackpot computer science ideas ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s people who do make debugging as hard as possible by doing try/catch everything blocks around every single function, essentially suppressing every single error.  Had one application, where the users didn&amp;#39;t even know it wasn&amp;#39;t working, they did data entry on this app for a year, and lost every bit of it because the developer used this pikachu (gotta catch em all!) exception handling, and always displayed a popup box saying that it saved successfully despite that it didn&amp;#39;t.  Ended up ripping most of them out, and the users blamed me for breaking it, because errors would occur constantly, despite that I spend three weeks fixing everything I could find myself.  Of course, there where no unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also: the guy my boss hired who couldn&amp;#39;t build a SQL statement.  He sent me the existing statement, the field he was supposed to add and the condition, and said how do I put this together?  Uh, try Google; selects aren&amp;#39;t that hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c60fdh7", "flair_text": null, "created": 1346244768.0, "created_utc": 1346241168.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_yzw66", "children": [], "author": "Flame_Alchemist", "id": "c60d6ex", "parent_id": "t3_yzw66", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 9, "body": "[Perspex](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/09/09/the-perspex-machine-superturin/), anyone?", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/09/09/the-perspex-machine-superturin/\"&gt;Perspex&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c60d6ex", "flair_text": null, "created": 1346225308.0, "created_utc": 1346221708.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 3, "link_id": "t3_yzw66", "children": [], "author": "SideburnsOfDoom", "id": "c60e72l", "parent_id": "t3_yzw66", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 11, "body": "Computer Science crackpots you say?

+T)/2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solving (T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +T)/2&amp;gt;100 for &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; T gives T &amp;gt; 14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The equation for E=2 might be familiar as it is &lt;a href=\"http://oeis.org/A000217\"&gt;the sequence of triangular numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Fourier Transform approach:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;z{g(T)=(T-1)+1+g(T-1)}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;Z{g(T)}= Z{T}+Z{g(T-1)}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;Z{g(T)}= z/(z-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
