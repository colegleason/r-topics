If you want to attend graduate school you should have some research done as an undergrad. This is not hard to obtain though. You can either go knocking on professors' doors or apply to external research programs such as REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates). I did both, first by asking around the department when I was a sophomore to do research over that summer. Then by applying to REUs and getting to accepted to one at the Uni of Neb-Lincoln. I did physics and astronomy education research during these projects. Besides research you'll want some strong letters of recommendation which you can obtain from professor by doing research or being a really good student in their course (going to office hours, answering questions, etc.).

The other credentials come down to you studying and working hard in your courses and preparing for the standardized tests if you need too. \n\nI do not feel worried that I won't find a job because I'm choosing to stay in academia, a.k.a. going to graduate school.

I have gotten into several schools and will make my decision later this semester. I do not regret my decision to pursue graduate school because I am passionate about research and know this is what I want to do after talking to multiple professors about staying in academia. If you're interested in doing graduate school for physics keep this in mind, most programs will fund you if you are choosing to pursue a doctorate degree (which takes about 5-7 years). They will fund you through either a teaching assistant-ship, research assistant-ship, fellowship, or scholarship. For example, for the several places I've been accepted they are offering me a full tuition wavier and a stipend for being a teaching assistant during the school year. \n\nFor advice, I would say make sure physics is something you are passionate about. If you do not know what field you are interested in, start going to colloquiums here to get an idea of what each subfield is like. Also, you can get an idea about which field you like when you take the respective courses. For advice on finding research, just start asking professors through email, or knock on their door and ask them in person.
