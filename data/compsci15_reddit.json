The resultant ciphertext is stored in the user&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;password&amp;#39; column. scrypt is instructed to take 0.5 seconds to encrypt/decrypt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The password can be up to 1000 characters in length, and no characters are disallowed. That&amp;#39;s very important. There&amp;#39;s absolutely no technical reason to arbitrarily restrict passwords. The salts are also pure bytes (values of 0-255), not just alphanumerics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your platform doesn&amp;#39;t have an scrypt library, use bcrypt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good info here -\n&lt;a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/401684/1135604\"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/a/401684/1135604&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4itykv", "flair_text": null, "created": 1335902076.0, "created_utc": 1335898476.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 3, "link_id": "t3_t0p9r", "children": [], "author": "738", "id": "c4ikgtg", "parent_id": "t3_t0p9r", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 11, "body": "~~Okay first off, **why do you need to store the password?**~~ This goes strongly against best practices. ~~Unless you need to recover the plaintext of the password (which in 99.9% of cases you should never have to), you should be storing a salted hash of the password.~~ \n\nHere's a short description of the best way to authenticate users through passwords.\n\n* Create a random and unique string or number for *each* user when they create their account.

Almost everything thought in a good computer science program can become useful.

Knowing how to apply dynamic programming to solve a problem can be particularly helpful. Graph algorithms are useful too to deal with things like pathway networks.   \n- *Graphics*: Knowing how to generate good visualizations is essential if you want to be able to communicate results. It is not necessary to know how to write your own 3d rendering engine from scratch, but knowing your way around 2d plotting library (like matplotlib) and a 3d plotting library (like vtk/mayavi) is a good start. \n- *Computer Vision*: Many techniques from computer vision can be applied to bioinformatics problems.

The techniques taught in S.E. tend to be outdated, and are more focused on how to use tools than actually learning how things work and the concepts behind them, which will remain constant even after the technologies upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4gvavm", "flair_text": null, "created": 1335458349.0, "created_utc": 1335454749.0, "num_reports": null}], "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "author_flair_class": null, "upvotes": 29, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "modhash": "208lu8rdaj9c627bccb7572edb6b2327d903ff2af92aeba8d4", "media_embed": {}, "more_comments": "", "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/compsci/comments/src00/computer_science_classes_i_would_like_to_see/", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t3_src00", "created": 1335335219.0, "url": "http://theexceptioncatcher.com/blog/2012/04/computer-science-classes-i-would-like-to-see-offered/#.T5eJRQuH9VM.reddit", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "monkeyscreatesoftwar", "created_utc": 1335331619.0, "link_flair_text": null, "media": null, "num_reports": null}, "789": {"domain": "defmacro.org", "link_flair_class": null, "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 29, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "subreddit": "compsci", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "saved": false, "id": "spi3f", "clicked": false, "title": "Functional Programming for the Rest of us", "num_comments": 15, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_spi3f", "children": [], "author": "Chimera999", "id": "c4fwjdp", "parent_id": "t3_spi3f", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 9, "body": "Great link.

He couldn't have done what he did without a deep understanding of math. He is known for his work in cryptanalysis during WWII, and setting the foundation of algorithms &amp; computation.\n\nAlonzo Church, Alan Turing's doctoral advisor, is famous for inventing the concept of the \"lambda calculus\", which forms the foundation of functional programming. The lambda calculus is a way to map math to computation by describing inputs &amp; outputs using \"functions\". The lambda calculus is evident not only in computer languages, but also modern math itself. For example, the derivative is a function that returns another function. So this creation was key to both computers &amp; math, especially evident in math software like MatLab, Maple, Mathematica. In languages like Python, you literally have a keyword called \"lambda\" that allows you to express functions.\n\nIf you trace Alan Turing back to the late 1700s &amp; early 1800s via doctoral advisors, you end up at Poisson, Lagrange, and Laplace, who all contributed a shit load to mathematics.\n\nOne of my old professors co-designed the RSA encryption algorithm, which is a one-way prime factorization that makes it nearly impossible to reverse in a reasonable amount of time. Couldn't have done it without math.\n\nAnother one of my old professors is a software engineer for Dreamworks, and he uses his knowledge of 3D math, computer architecture, graphics, OpenGL, shaders, etc. to create advanced software tools for the artists and editors to use on the films.  So he kind of blends the line between 'academic/research' &amp; 'practical engineering'.\n\nLogic &amp; computer architecture are critical, if you want to be a great programmer. You can deal in abstractions all day, but as soon as the abstraction breaks down or fails you in some way, you have to be able to diagnosis problems at a more fundamental level.\n\nIf you're more interested in the academic or otherwise bleeding-edge research side of things, then math is most likely going to be absolutely critical, and it really depends on what you want to do to say which kind of math is more important than another.\n\nIf you just want to get good at programming and one day get a job as a programmer/developer, then what people are saying here about focusing on the programming itself is very sound advice.  As a developer, I spend most of my time trying to wrap my head around all the abstractions that people have invented to make dealing with computers easier (supposedly!). So I don't get a chance to use math all that much - not nearly as much as I thought I would before I got a job. I worked as a game developer and used some math here and there, but even at that job and subsequent jobs the more important thing has been an in-depth understanding of all the major abstraction layers that I encounter, and how to do things efficiently (CPU- &amp; memory-wise, and also networking).\n\nTo be a great programmer, it's also critical to have a great understanding of software engineering practices/pitfalls, and also the language(s) you are using. Those are very conceptual things, for the most part. A lot of software engineering comes down to conceptual/organizational puzzles. Not only that, but it can also be a social test in dealing with your managers and/or clients and their fickle needs, and how that can sometimes significantly alter how you organize something.\n\nI work as a mobile developer now, and to be honest we just don't deal with math that much. My job has a LOT more to do with dealing with all the conceptual abstractions - libraries, IDEs, compilation, compression, encryption, file formats, tool chains/pipelines, command line scripting &amp; tools, APIs, languages, etc.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers have their foundation in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing was primarily a mathematician, and a computer scientist second.

In languages like Python, you literally have a keyword called &amp;quot;lambda&amp;quot; that allows you to express functions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you trace Alan Turing back to the late 1700s &amp;amp; early 1800s via doctoral advisors, you end up at Poisson, Lagrange, and Laplace, who all contributed a shit load to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my old professors co-designed the RSA encryption algorithm, which is a one-way prime factorization that makes it nearly impossible to reverse in a reasonable amount of time. Couldn&amp;#39;t have done it without math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another one of my old professors is a software engineer for Dreamworks, and he uses his knowledge of 3D math, computer architecture, graphics, OpenGL, shaders, etc. to create advanced software tools for the artists and editors to use on the films.  So he kind of blends the line between &amp;#39;academic/research&amp;#39; &amp;amp; &amp;#39;practical engineering&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic &amp;amp; computer architecture are critical, if you want to be a great programmer. You can deal in abstractions all day, but as soon as the abstraction breaks down or fails you in some way, you have to be able to diagnosis problems at a more fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re more interested in the academic or otherwise bleeding-edge research side of things, then math is most likely going to be absolutely critical, and it really depends on what you want to do to say which kind of math is more important than another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you just want to get good at programming and one day get a job as a programmer/developer, then what people are saying here about focusing on the programming itself is very sound advice.  As a developer, I spend most of my time trying to wrap my head around all the abstractions that people have invented to make dealing with computers easier (supposedly!). So I don&amp;#39;t get a chance to use math all that much - not nearly as much as I thought I would before I got a job. I worked as a game developer and used some math here and there, but even at that job and subsequent jobs the more important thing has been an in-depth understanding of all the major abstraction layers that I encounter, and how to do things efficiently (CPU- &amp;amp; memory-wise, and also networking).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be a great programmer, it&amp;#39;s also critical to have a great understanding of software engineering practices/pitfalls, and also the language(s) you are using. Those are very conceptual things, for the most part. A lot of software engineering comes down to conceptual/organizational puzzles. Not only that, but it can also be a social test in dealing with your managers and/or clients and their fickle needs, and how that can sometimes significantly alter how you organize something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work as a mobile developer now, and to be honest we just don&amp;#39;t deal with math that much. My job has a LOT more to do with dealing with all the conceptual abstractions - libraries, IDEs, compilation, compression, encryption, file formats, tool chains/pipelines, command line scripting &amp;amp; tools, APIs, languages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4ffn51", "flair_text": null, "created": 1335154624.0, "created_utc": 1335151024.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_sn3q2", "children": [], "author": "bo1024", "id": "c4fcu5b", "parent_id": "t3_sn3q2", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 8, "body": "If you do a search you'll find some threads on this.

You have probably heard of some of the problems we tackle here, sequence alignment of protein or DNA/RNA sequences and structural prediction of RNA and proteins, each of which are quite large subfields on their own but there are many others such as finding genes on a dna sequence, motif finding and dna sequencing and phylogeny. In this field we often use heuristics instead of exact calculations, because there is so much data.\n * **Functional genomics**: Using genetic data to understand and model the functions and interactions between genes or proteins. Here you would find, among others, problems involving function or interaction prediction, prediction of expression levels.\n * **Imaging**: A large part of bioinformatics is interested in imagine, particularly medical bioinformatics. In this field you receive a bunch of images from medical imaging equipment or microscopy, from which something must be calculated. A friend of mine was accepted at a conference recently for his work on tracking the growth of tuberculosis in zebrafish.\n * **Systems Biology**: Here you model components in a cell. For example, we had a course on Metabolic analysis, where you model the fluxes of metabolites in the cell. By analyzing the steady state of the network, you can find the primary 'extreme pathways' that make up the system. You can use the methods on this field to, for example, optimize the production of a certain metabolite under for an organism by seeing the effects of knocking out proteins or modifying the conditions under which the cell operates.\n * **Visualization**: Once you have some output, you'll probably have a lot of it! Looking at all the data is retarded, so you would visualize it somehow in order to understand the results.\n * **Databases**: This is of vital importance, but together with visualization is often ignored, when in reality, without well designed data storage we wouldn't be able to have many of our most used tools such as BLAST.\n\nMany of these fields overlap, and in almost all of them we are using statistics and machine learning techniques to solve the problems.\nThe focus of your education will vary depending upon the institution you study at; at mine there is a strong focus on pattern recognition/machine learning, while at others the focus may be more on structure prediction, or sequencing.\nAs far as programming is concerned, I have yet to see a field where you don't.\nProgramming is a tool and we use it all the time.\nIt is important to not forget that while we do all this, we are constantly using tools developed by computer scientists, mathematicians and even physicists.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a Computer Science Bachelor currently working on my Master&amp;#39;s Thesis at the Bioinformatics programme offered jointly by &lt;a href=\"http://bio.leidendelft.nl/\"&gt;Leiden University and TU Delft&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bioinformatics is a large field, and even two bioinformaticians can sit down and not have a clue what the other is saying.\nHere are some examples of the subfields that might explain the size of this &amp;#39;specialization&amp;#39;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Computational biology&lt;/strong&gt;: In this area, you would generally be operating on biological sequences.

I guess this is what people usually think of when they think of algorithms. I'm sure there are plenty of books with interesting problems.\n\n**Functional Programming:** Very awesome, a completely different way of thinking about programming.
