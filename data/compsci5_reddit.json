The difference lies in the fact that the sender waits for the recipient to acknowledge the start of the communication before sending data.\n\nConnection-oriented protocols work like this: when a sender wants to begin a conversation with a recipient, the sender first sends a \"hello\" packet, called a SYN, to the recipient. The recipient acknowledges receipt of the SYN by sending a \"hello\" response packet back, called a SYN-ACK (standing for SYNchronize ACKnowledge). Then, the sender, upon receipt of the SYN-ACK, sends an ACK, acknowledge packet to the recipient, establishing the beginning of the conversation.\n\nConnection-oriented protocols specify certain measures for things like error correction, packet ordering, and flow control, which connectionless protocols do not. Think of it this way, in a connection oriented communication, the sender is actually listening to the recipient, making sure that the recipient acknowledges receipt of data, and tells the recipient the proper way to order data packets. Connectionless protocols basically constitute a sender just throwing data at a recipient - there's no checking to make sure the recipient is receiving data in the proper order, uncorrupted, or if it's even receiving the data packets at all.\n\nVisualize it like two people on the phone.

CS50x has more of a community, uplifting, 'people' feel to it, while MIT's seems more focused and technical. For example, CS50x's lectures have a guy on stage lecturing and trying hard to connect with the audience (Harvard students). MIT's lectures are one dude in front of his screen. CS50x is meant to be broad, covering a wide range of programming/CS, starting with C then later web programming such as PHP and HTML.\n\nThe advantages of EdX:\nYou get the community. You get the name recognition on your certificate of achievement. You get in-browser code-checking. And best of all you start with the fundamentals, giving you a great foundation for further study. The programs are really well-designed, having been used at MIT and Harvard for many years.\n\nMy personal route:\nI use 6.00x and CS101 as my CS foundation and Python Hard way and Code Academy to be brush-up on the Python/programming.

Recently, I've been looking into the overlaps between philosophy (of the analytic kind, concerned with logic and math) and computer science, which I have always found to be interesting but daunting. I love logic, and have an affinity for math as well. I have worked with, among other stuff, developing my own systems of modal logic for different concepts. So I guess my basic questions are: Is hardcore theoretical logic of use to computer science, and what are some ways to get to use my skills in logic within computer science? In other words - where do I start? As I said, I'm more interested in the theoretical aspects than in programming. Is it worth looking into computer science from such a viewpoint at all?\n\nThanks for reading.", "saved": false, "id": "12ci5y", "clicked": false, "title": "The affinity between compsci, analytic philosophy and logic", "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_12ci5y", "children": [], "author": "anvsdt", "id": "c6ty1sn", "parent_id": "t3_12ci5y", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 17, "body": "Since every logic gives rise to a type system (i.e. [Curry-Howard isomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_isomorphism)) I'd suggest type theory.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since every logic gives rise to a type system (i.e. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_isomorphism\"&gt;Curry-Howard isomorphism&lt;/a&gt;) I&amp;#39;d suggest type theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c6ty1sn", "flair_text": null, "created": 1351624457.0, "created_utc": 1351620857.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_12ci5y", "children": [], "author": "carette", "id": "c6tzhdb", "parent_id": "t3_12ci5y", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 12, "body": "Yes, definitely worth looking into things this way.

I'm wondering what exactly the strategy would be for using a sub-optimal approximation algorithm when attempting to find solutions.\n\nFor example, in combinatorial testing, there are many solutions for finding t-wise testing on a set of variables, and we don't care about finding the best; we just want one that's not terrible. But there are even more answers that don't meet the criteria of the constraints (i.e., not all t-wise tuples are represented in the solution).\n\nSo, when building a simulated annealing algorithm to find a solution to n-queens or t-wise testing, what is the strategy to avoid returning a solution that is not only suboptimal solution, but also doesn't even meet the criteria of the constraints? Similarly, how would you know if a given set of inputs even has a solution (e.g., t-wise testing + variable combination constraints could yield no valid covering array).", "saved": false, "id": "1376z1", "clicked": false, "title": "Question about Simulated Annealing for Discrete Constraint Satisfaction Problems", "num_comments": 0, "comments": [], "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "author_flair_class": null, "upvotes": 3, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "modhash": "vj6k0hmneya6b007f931845d80e813a2c910a12add84efccd2", "media_embed": {}, "more_comments": "", "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/compsci/comments/1376z1/question_about_simulated_annealing_for_discrete/", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t3_1376z1", "created": 1352925547.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1376z1/question_about_simulated_annealing_for_discrete/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "glhanes", "created_utc": 1352925547.0, "link_flair_text": null, "media": null, "num_reports": null}, "251": {"domain": "self.compsci", "link_flair_class": null, "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 14, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "subreddit": "compsci", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting to the end of my first semester of junior year as a CS undergrad student.

They are normal in a computer science curriculum.  You will learn about logic gates and binary representation of numbers.  You&amp;#39;ll also learn about assembly language programming.  Later on in Architecture you&amp;#39;ll learn more about the CPU, the memory hierarchy and cache, virtual memory management and much, much more.
