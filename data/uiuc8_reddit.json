He brought the campus community together and was an important part of the University culture. The loss of this symbol has left a hole in the community. Since he was always portrayed respectfully, and had support from Native Americans at some point (?), it is unfair to call him racist and anyone who says otherwise is being oversensitive or is unaware of all of the details of the Chief. Some people have said that the Chief was banned simply because the NCAA wished it to be so, without any feedback from the campus community. Some people in this group respect the decision to cease use of the Chief, while some are very unhappy with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Against: The Chief is a racist caricature of what it means to be Native American. He would dress up in the expected attire, and do a dance that people would expect a Native American to do. The dance is offensive because it is based on stereotypical movements with Boy Scout routines or religious ceremonial dance (both have been stated in the comments), and the costume is offensive because there are parts of it that have significance with spirituality, community, and other important aspects of NA culture.

Preiss people came to U of I and opened up a parent company here under the name of University Village. University Village owns Gabes Place (they kept the name) as well as this other company called Sleep UofI. So there are basically 4 different companies under the parent name of Preiss. And they all don&amp;#39;t communicate with each other. They also lost all of our paperwork and records. We have had to go to the bank multiple times to give them records that we paid the rent. Sometimes they will attempt to evict us or bill us by just placing a note on the door (with our bank account info) and when we call to figure things out, they just claim there is &amp;quot;a system error&amp;quot; or make us go back to the bank for records. This has happened multiple times within the last six months. They also changed our locks twice this summer without notice. They locked me and my room mates out without notice, we couldn&amp;#39;t get into our apt for a day... they changed the locks at 10am when we were all out... and their office was closed until 3pm the next day. That was a good day...... And every time we call to figure things out, they are always saying we are missing payments (false) security deposits (false) or last months rent (false). And when you call the Gabes Place number, they say &amp;quot;oh University Village has this info.. call them&amp;quot; and when you call UV, they say &amp;quot;oh Gabes Place has this info...&amp;quot; and no one gets back to you. The only person who seemed competent was this woman named Megan, and she just recently left the job. My room mates and I all moved out to begin student teaching this week and they emailed us saying we are going to be evicted this week. We don&amp;#39;t even live there anymore! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our lease also said we were to live there until December 2012. They have records of us living there until July 2013. Even when we send over the documents, it seems as if they cannot process it and completely ignore them and continue to use their &amp;quot;system.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also had a squirrel living in my ceiling for two months that dug a hole through my ceiling above my bed. They refused to come out to fix it for the longest time.

Here are a few tips to save you some dough I&amp;#39;ve learned over the past 3.5 years as a student from a low-income family:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) All instructors are required to make texts available on reserve (usually at the main stacks or ugl). If the instructor is giving you a BS &amp;quot;invest in your education&amp;quot; response or is resisting to do so in any way explain how not putting the book on reserve (either in a library or on e-reserves) is an act of discrimination against low income students. &lt;strong&gt;Be polite in emails&lt;/strong&gt; and go above your professor only if they refuse to put something on reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Use our library system! There are usually a few copies of smaller books/novels in one of the over 20 libraries on campus. Check early before the semester starts and you can renew a book up to 4 times (that&amp;#39;s 14 weeks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Use the I-SHARE system (&lt;a href=\"http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/all/vf/\"&gt;http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/all/vf/&lt;/a&gt;). You can use your UIUC Library account to access this. Basically how this works is you search a database of university libraries in Illinois for books you need. If you find it, and you usually will, you can request the book to be sent to UIUC&amp;#39;s main stacks where you can check it out. You can renew up to 4 times with these books as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Help yourself and other Illini by using the Illini Book Exchange (&lt;a href=\"http://www.illinibookexchange.com/splash.php5\"&gt;http://www.illinibookexchange.com/splash.php5&lt;/a&gt;). Here you can buy and sell used texts (this is especially nice for harder to find math/science/engineering texts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Rent you texts! You can do this at one of the local greedy textbook shops or online through various websites (Amazon, Chegg, etc..). Shop around for the cheapest rate for a semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6) If you absolutely need to buy a text, don&amp;#39;t go to Follets, TIS, or the Union Bookstore unless you can&amp;#39;t find cheaper options online. These stores are convenient but are almost always incredibly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7) Buy or rent older editions of textbooks. Many professors write the books for their classes and require students to buy the most up to date edition. 9 out of 10 times these new editions are just scams to get more money. Most professors will be honest when you ask if an older edition is okay, so be sure to ask. If they say you need the newest edition (usually a response if they wrote the book), ask exactly why. Chances are the old one will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;8) Share texts with friends. If you need to buy an expensive text, share the financial burden with someone else! A $150 text isn&amp;#39;t as daunting when you split it with a friend. Just be sure to create a fair plan for who uses the book when (this can lead to conflict near exam time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9) Thank your professors/TA&amp;#39;s who make every effort to get texts on reserves and help you find the cheapest option. It is always refreshing to meet a university instructor who actually cares about you as a student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope these help!

You say &amp;quot;you usually will&amp;quot; find the book in I-Share, but that&amp;#39;s misleading.  I&amp;#39;m a librarian who regularly helps students search I-Share for their textbooks, and your odds of finding them in the catalog are only a little better than 50/50.  Once you&amp;#39;ve found it, the majority of the time it&amp;#39;ll be unrequestable from the library that owns it (either it&amp;#39;s permanently unrequestable, they have it in course reserves themselves, or it&amp;#39;s already checked out).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying not to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; getting your books through I-Share, just that it&amp;#39;s not going to have a high rate of success and you pretty much have to do it as soon as you can find out what textbooks you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": "bluei", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c7vs6d0", "flair_text": "Alumnus, GSLIS", "created": 1358031773.0, "created_utc": 1358028173.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_16g2sq", "children": [], "author": "kushblunts", "id": "c7vtm4p", "parent_id": "t3_16g2sq", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 2, "body": "you forgot illini book exchange.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you forgot illini book exchange.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "UIUC", "flair_class": "bluei", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c7vtm4p", "flair_text": "NRES", "created": 1358036789.0, "created_utc": 1358033189.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkxs", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_16g2sq", "children": [], "author": "RionMan", "id": "c7vvirh", "parent_id": "t3_16g2sq", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "The Illini Book Exchange is awesome.
