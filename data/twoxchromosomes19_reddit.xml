Don't get me wrong, I love being a woman, and I love who I am as a person. That said, I have *the worst* case of penis envy, to the point of fetishizing it. I can't be alone here, anyone else with me?  No, but I do like the idea of switching bodies with my SO, just once, and having sex with myself.

I don't know if this makes me gay or a major narcissist.  My SO and I have talked about how cool that would be - just so he would know what it was like to have a vagina, and I would know what it was like to have a penis. He said he'd spend the day just sticking things up there ... I reckon I'd just go around peeing on things.

He said he'd spend the day just sticking things up there ... I reckon I'd just go around peeing on things.  You're not alone. I definitely identify as female and wouldn't have it any other way, but I fantasize about having a penis and penetrating other women. I should try a strap-on I guess? I've tried it a few times. I'm very glad to have an open-minded (read: rather kinky) boyfriend.

And yes, it was VERY fun :) I've tried it a few times. I'm very glad to have an open-minded (read: rather kinky) boyfriend.

If by penis envy you mean envy of things people with penises don't have to worry about then yes (UTIs after sex, having to take down your pants to pee, etc etc.) but if you mean actually wanting a penis then no. I'd also like to aim when I pee! Considering they have such a super-power, they sure seem to miss a lot of the time!

Fetishizing dicks isn't a problem is it?  Why don't you just get a strap-on and have some fun? Oh I have one, and I do. I never thought it was a problem, just jealous that it's the one thing I won't get to TRULY feel.   [deleted] This had also crossed my mind. Sometimes when I want to, the thought of having to clean toys later stops me from it. siiighhhh. Maybe I'm just lazy. [deleted] Really?  Guys need tissues and lotion whereas we can bate in bed, cum and go to sleep without any cleanup.            If you mean that you really are turned on by, and enjoy playing with your partner's penis, then  that just means you're normal - you dont have a fetish!  Those are a given. What I mean is, I wish I *HAD* one, even for a day, to know what it feels like for guys. That's the fetishy part, as in imagining I have one is a huge turn-on.  I can tell you penis's tend to be annoying. I'm really only glad I have one, when I get to use the world as my toilet by peeing anywhere I want. So I'm curious what your fascination is with penis.        [deleted] </snippet></document><document><title>Basically I got asked out for Valentines Day and said yes because I didn't want to hurt him. I don't want a relationship. More Details inside. I could really use some advice. Let me know if this isn't the right sub.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18egsl/basically_i_got_asked_out_for_valentines_day_and/</url><snippet>Hi twoxchromosomes. I'm using a throwaway because he might know my normal username.

 I'm 18 and have been home schooled since 7th grade (for health reasons and later educational) I drifted from my two closest friends at that time because one began doing drugs and the other was very boy crazy. I have always been sort of a loner. I have an easily time talking to people but never seem to get closer than friendly acquaintances. As of now I don't have anyone I can say is a close friend. It's because of this that I don't feel like I want or need a romantic relationship. 

We had a class together last semester but didn't really talk. Lately we've been talking between classes. He's nice and I can't say I dislike him. He asked me out for Valentines day today and he seemed so nervousness that I felt that saying no would really hurt him. Later he told me he never asked anyone out before. I don't want to hurt his feeling but I also don't want to mislead him. 

Should I go to lunch with him and just tell him after that I don't want to be anything more than friends? 

Should I cancel? 

Let me know what you think.

Edit: I feel that I should clarify that I've never had a boyfriend. I've went on a few dates but never seemed to like anyone more than friends.  You should let him know that you'll still go to lunch with him, but it will only be as platonic friends.  After that, let him decide if he wants to still go to lunch or not.

You don't want to go into the lunch with him thinking it's a date and you not...that just leads to bad problems down the road.  Everyone is going to hurt someone else's feelings at some point, and it sucks no matter what. Also, do not feel obligated to explain why you want to remain friends. He might ask and try to guilt you into saying something/anything and what you want to say may not be what you end up saying (pressure in the moment and all...).  Furthermore, saying anything at all may make him even more determined to try to convince you to make a relationship work. 

TL;DR - he will mostly ask you to explain why you don't want to give the relationship a try. YOU DO NOT OWE HIM AN EXPLANATION. You should let him know that you'll still go to lunch with him, but it will only be as platonic friends.  After that, let him decide if he wants to still go to lunch or not.

You don't want to go into the lunch with him thinking it's a date and you not...that just leads to bad problems down the road.  Everyone is going to hurt someone else's feelings at some point, and it sucks no matter what.   i wouldn't go out on valentine's day with him... but ehhh i say why not go to see a movie with him, or have coffee? just because you don't want or need a romantic relationship doesn't mean you can't go on one date. i don't want or need a relationship but i'm cool with the idea of one, so i date people sometimes. sometimes in spite of myself, because people do surprise you. it's a few hours and a few dollars at most and you might have fun.   i did this when i was like 14 or 15. i wish i had backed out. it was a really bad time. we went to a fair and he would pay for stuff and that made me feel even worse. feeling bad for leading him on is much worse then feeling bad for turning him down i don't know, i am not sure that's a great attitude to take. 

maybe he was happy to spend time with you? how many times did you go out with him? i would hardly say going out with a guy one time to give him a chance is the worst thing a person can do.  if shes not into him shes just not into him   </snippet></document><document><title>Took a stand at my Catholic church group last night</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18d92b/took_a_stand_at_my_catholic_church_group_last/</url><snippet>   To give some background I am a practicing Catholic, but I do not like to define myself by my religion. I like to humbly think of myself as open-minded and at University I am loving all my religious studies classes which open my mind to new traditions and interesting intellectual debates with my fellow students of many backgrounds, including atheists, agnostics, and people of other faiths.  

   Last night I went to the student mass at my Catholic church and attended a 'soup and fellowship' event which happens every week. They hand out fantastic soup, we hang out, and often listen to some speakers -- usually St. Vincent de Paul society or another charity, which are great. Last night however, the talk was lead by a priest who runs a ministry called 'Courage' for youth experiencing Same-Sex attractions. I was immediately uncomfortable with the talk and felt I was going to disagree, but decided to stay and listen anyways to see exactly what his message was. What I heard appalled me. The priest was quite obviously medicalizing homosexuality, using terms such as "affects" and "afflicts", as if it was some sort of disease, even calling it SSA (same-sex attraction) instead of homosexuality. 

   I think my parish priest knew that I was getting uncomfortable, and I could see him glancing over at me, as if to check on me. What really set me off was when he started listing a series of causes of homosexuality which included depression, an absent father, and (I kid you not), an "inability to play sports requiring hand-eye co-ordination such as baseball or soccer". As if not making the soccer team caused you to be gay. The whole thing was completely shocking to me, I suppose mostly because in the Catholic church it seems to more of a 'love them, and don't talk about it' attitude, I often forget it's even an issue, except for gay marriage of course (which I recognize I do diverge from most Catholics by supporting marriage equality). 

   After some more completely unfounded, hurtful, and uninformed statements, I found myself just pulsing with rage. I stood up calmly as I could, and said "I'm sorry, I just can't listen to this anymore. There is **NOTHING** wrong with gay people." And stormed out. 

  A few others followed me out, and I was also followed by some other Catholic students trying to calm me down and talk about it. A friend of mine ended up staying, which she profusely apologized for and agreed that the talk was insane and in her own words "disgusting", but she did inform me that the group moved on like nothing happened, and at the end the priest asked everyone to pray for me.

   So that's it. I made a stand and now I have a whole group of people praying for my supposedly lost soul. I guess I'm just looking for a little support, love, and maybe some solace in fellow human beings who think there is nothing *treat* in regards to a person's sexual orientation. 

TL;DR: Catholic youth group was all like BOOO gay people, so I was all like BOOO you. Now being prayed for.

UPDATE EDIT:
Thank you all for your helpful suggestions and kind words. I am working on writing an open letter to the CSA (Catholic's Student Association) which I will post here if people are interested for constructive criticism. I also just booked a meeting with my parish priest, and we will be hashing it out at 10:30 tomorrow. I'm fairly nervous about it and I will try to come prepared as I can.   I know you might not like to acknowledge it, but this is an official belief of the Catholic church (I was also raised Catholic)

I understand this may be a big part of your life and your identity, but would you consider branching out to a nondenominational church or one that shares your more liberal attitudes? Maybe you would be able to find people there who agree with your stands instead of "praying for you" to agree with theirs

Christians are not all closed-minded and there are even some that do take the official stance that you agree with. I understand that you are a Catholic and you are comfortable with that label but it is difficult to be a Catholic without actually agreeing with the teachings of the Catholic church. 

If this means a lot to you I hope you can find another denomination or group of people who are open minded and not subtly full of hate and bigotry  Yes, I do recognize that the official position of the church is that homosexuality is not wrong in itself, but acting on it is, and that homosexual persons are called to live in chastity, but otherwise be treated with love and respect. 
Yes, that is definitely some sound advice, but I find myself not leaning towards it. I am a practicing Catholic because it's my tradition more then my beliefs (except of course in the fundamentals like the 10 commandments and basic teachings about love and generosity). It's my family tradition and it makes me feel close to them. 
When I told my father about the situation he agreed the talk sounded very extreme and several parts completely out of line, and said to me that "The church belongs to me, just as much as it does to people like that." But working within it would be a very hard and likely futile journey. &amp;gt;homosexual persons are called to live in chastity, but otherwise be treated with love and respect. 

I'm sorry but do you really believe this? Do you really believe that people who are gay (that have nothing wrong with them, like you said) should live completely chaste lives? Devoid of any romantic relationship because they happen to be attracted to the same sex? Do you really believe they do not deserve love?

&amp;gt; the talk sounded very extreme

But just remember this is what Caholicism believes. It's not wrong to recognize that the beliefs of your denomination or religion are outdated and insulting, because they are. Is there a way that you can identify as a practicing member of the Catholic faith (I was in a youth group, too, once. Until we were forced to watch anti-abortion videos and go on a weekend long pro life retreat) and then disagree with some of the main beliefs of Catholicism?  Do I believe that? *Absolutely not.* As I said in my post 
&amp;gt;I recognize I do diverge from most Catholics by supporting marriage equality.

And actually, I wrote a letter to the guy who walked me home on Facebook stating exactly that. Who am I to tell someone they can't experience the intimate loving relationships we all want?

I guess then, what I am struggling with deciding now at this point, is do I leave my tradition, or do I try to convince the community around me that they are in need of change?
I don't know the answer to that yet, I will start by talking to my parish priest about what I disagreed with (EVERYTHING) and possibly writing an open letter to the Catholic Students Association of my school outlining my beliefs and disagreements with our teachings, at least stir up some debate.

Oh sorry, I misinterpreted your last post because you said after that it was sound advice. 

I would love to say you can try and convince the community around you but Catholic churches aren't influenced by the people around them. They are influenced by the bishops and priests and the pope and the official stances of the church. 

I was supposed to make my confirmation and I decided not to (my parents ended up forcing me into it). You cannot change the mind of a priest or religious person or group. You can change yourself. But deciding to just ignore the most bigoted and ignorant parts of your religion while still practicing it and belonging to it because it's your "tradition" is a slippery slope

It seems like this may be the point in your life when you're realizing the deep hypocrisy in religion. It can be very good for your intellectual growth, explore it Ah I see the misunderstanding, sorry about that formatting.
I agree that it is a very slippery slope, to just cling to the comfortable because it's what I know. It's tough because sometimes I am very, very encouraged by prominent Catholics working in the community such as 
[Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/02/catholic-church-martini.html) who recently passed away and fought for reform and change in the church as a respected and high up member. He's known for criticizing the Church for how they dealt with pedophile scandals, handing out the Eucharist to non-Catholics, among other things. My favourite quote from his writings are  "Our culture has aged, our churches are big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our cassocks are pompous." Coming from a Catholic Cardinal! Imagine if he was the Pope, how much easier my life would be.  I'm really trying my hardest to be respectful of your faith so I'm sorry if I come across as callous or jaded or anything. I was disillusioned with Catholicism and religion in general since I was a child (if you look closely a lot of things in the bible and the church just don't...agree with each other. If this is the word of God why does most of it no longer apply to life and society now? Why is so much of it contradictory? Why can some parts be 'metaphorical' and others literal?) I had too many questions and the priests don't like nosy outspoken children I guess. I left the church as soon as possible and my mom still holds a little resentment towards me for it (she says it's "just a phase")

I hope you find what you're looking for. It's difficult to reconcile being both a liberal and religious because the two are not really in agreement. Unless you actually believe and practice the true basic teachings of Jesus , because real or not he sounds like a pretty chill guy. 

 No, no, don't worry! My boyfriend has a real inherent distaste for organized religion and I enjoy having long debates about the subject, I find it fascinating. 
Agreed, these are excellent questions. The one passage I really hold on to in the Bible is Jesus's parable about the wineskins. Pharisees and respected members of the Jewish community are interrogating him, asking why his disciples don't follow the traditions a Jewish man is supposed to such as fasting? And he says to them that you don't sew an old piece of cloth on a new one, it tears and the garment is ruined. You don't put new wine in old wineskins, it causes the skin to burst and you lose the new wine. 
I always got from that that Jesus himself struggled with those same questions, of ritual applying to a new, modern way of life. His decision was to throw out the old traditions when they were no longer relevant.
I don't know if that's how a Catholic priest would interpret the passage, but that's my favourite because it always encouraged me that Jesus wanted change, and change should be continual and essential in the Church. Definitely a radical founder for a Church which is now so ironically conservative.

 That's really insightful. I hope you find what you're looking for and I don't want to be a downer but I don't think change inside the catholic church is going to come from you (and let's face it, especially not a woman.)

BUT the only thing is I would probably be careful when writing to your catholic student union (are you in college?) You can be kicked out of a religious school for writing to the Catholic Students Association of your school for outlining your beliefs and disagreements with their teachings. A school affiliated with religion can drop you for not adhering to the teachings of that religion  Do I believe that? *Absolutely not.* As I said in my post 
&amp;gt;I recognize I do diverge from most Catholics by supporting marriage equality.

I don't know the answer to that yet, I will start by talking to my parish priest about what I disagreed with (EVERYTHING) and possibly writing an open letter to the Catholic Students Association of my school outlining my beliefs and disagreements with our teachings, at least stir up some debate.  You cannot convince the community around you to change, because Catholicism's moral norms cannot change. They are based on the concept of objective morality, meaning if something is true, it is ALWAYS true, regardless of the time period and the sentiment of the general population.  Since scripture condemns homosexual activity and Church documents do the same, you'd be fighting a useless battle.

As archaic and non-compassionate as the beliefs are, they cannot change. If you don't share the same beliefs, then you need to ask yourself if you want to be Catholic at all, because you can't be a faithful Catholic (receiving the Eucharist, for example) while disagreeing with the Church's morality. But then again... why would you want to associate yourself with a group which you feel holds harmful beliefs, anyway? I would like to argue that things indeed HAVE changed in the Catholic church during history -- an obvious example being the Crusades. I know it would be an obvious statement from the papacy now to not kill others who do not share Catholic beliefs. They were called back to their commandment "Thou shalt not kill". 
I, in some way, think this issue may be similar. I do hope someday that the church is called back to "Loving thy neighbor."
That is a great question that I am thinking about and meditating a lot on however, thank you for the though provoking comment.  The issue is "thou shalt not MURDER", not merely "kill". One can kill in self-defence and not be guilty of mortal sin. In a just war (see Augustine and Aquinas' thoughts on the just war theory) one can kill and not be guilty of mortal sin. As messy as the crusades were, they were viewed as a just cause, and thus killing during those wars were not considered mortally sinful. Even if a just war were to arise today, killing in that war would not be considered mortally sinful (in general). That hasn't changed.

The whole issue of Church teaching is more complicated and intricate than it sounds. You will never find a legitimate Catholic church accepting homosexual activity (gay marriage included) as okay. You will never find a legitimate Catholic church accepting abortion as okay. These things won't change, because they can't change. There is such a long and clear history dating back to the Apostles that shows that such things were never accepted as okay, that it would be impossible to change them. You make a good point in that several key stances stay the same. But I would like to point out that Jesus made no comment about homosexual persons in the New Testament, therefore there is no infallible word of God that would prohibit the Church from changing their minds if they have had a leader that really wanted to one could argue. 
Another example is the selling of indulgences that resulted in a the Protestant schism, the Church did in fact reform after the outrage.  &amp;gt;homosexual persons are called to live in chastity, but otherwise be treated with love and respect. 

I'm sorry but do you really believe this? Do you really believe that people who are gay (that have nothing wrong with them, like you said) should live completely chaste lives? Devoid of any romantic relationship because they happen to be attracted to the same sex? Do you really believe they do not deserve love?

&amp;gt; the talk sounded very extreme

Until we were forced to watch anti-abortion videos and go on a weekend long pro life retreat) and then disagree with some of the main beliefs of Catholicism?  I'd just like to disagree with the statement that being without a romantic relationship means that you are without love.

Edit: I am not talking strictly within the confines of gays or the Catholic Church. I am disagreeing with the statement that you can't have love if you can't have sex. That is ALL.  What? What are you supposed to do, love from afar or something? 

And before you try and be a stickler I mean romantic love (like two people in a relationship), not like the love of your parents Who says that love exists exclusively within a romantic relationship?  What are you talking about? &amp;gt; Devoid of any romantic relationship because they happen to be attracted to the same sex? Do you really believe they do not deserve love?

This implies that love only exists within a romantic relationship. Of course they deserve love. Romantic love is not the only fulfilling love, and not being able to have sex with each other does not mean that the relationship is devoid of romantic love.  &amp;gt;And before you try and be a stickler I mean romantic love (like two people in a relationship), not like the love of your parents

And really? You believe that you can be in a fulfilling relationship without romantic love? What kind of love would you have for your partner, then? Paternal love? Sisterly love? The kind of love you have for a pet? 

So gay people deserve love, just not romantic love. And being "chaste" means never, ever acting on their desire for each other in any way. No kissing, no hand holding, no sex of ANY kind, no physical contact that friends or peers wouldn't find particularly appropriate, nothing. You really think that's a relationship? 

That's repression, and a particularly nasty kind too. It's repression wrapped in repression and steeped in religious tradition under the guise of tolerance Yes, I do recognize that the official position of the church is that homosexuality is not wrong in itself, but acting on it is, and that homosexual persons are called to live in chastity, but otherwise be treated with love and respect. 
Yes, that is definitely some sound advice, but I find myself not leaning towards it. I am a practicing Catholic because it's my tradition more then my beliefs (except of course in the fundamentals like the 10 commandments and basic teachings about love and generosity). It's my family tradition and it makes me feel close to them.

But working within it would be a very hard and likely futile journey. If you're looking for a church with the same rituals but more liberal attitudes, consider Episcopalian or ELCA Lutheran (NOT any other US Lutherans because they're absolutely nuts) both of which have or are working towards allowing gay marriage within the church and are more liberal in general. And when I (lapsed Lutheran) go to Episcopalian or Catholic services, I know them by heart. Even the creeds are the same; we just don't capitalize Catholic when we say "I believe in the holy catholic church." I was raised ELCA Lutheran and went to an ELCA Lutheran affiliated college. My church has had a rainbow triangle sign on it for as long as I can remember (this means "Yo Gays, we welcome you here!") and my school definitely had no problem with it.  I was also active in the Milwaukee Metro area youth Lutheran scene (my friend from home was a Youth leader at a church near Milwaukee) and had some discussions with kids going to a Missouri Lutheran school. There aren't any Missouri Lutherans where I grew up so hearing about what they believed was just like "What the fuck" to me.  I talked to a 14 year old girl who was told by all her FRIENDS that she was going to hell and was a sinner because she KISSED A BOY. 

It enrages me to even think about. My whole concept of church was formed around such accepting individuals and never was fire, brimstone, or hell ever brought into the equation when related to sinning. It is very hard for me to realize that someone might equate THOSE LUTHERANS with the church that I grew up in. I was raised ELCA Lutheran and went to an ELCA Lutheran affiliated college.

FYI, that's because "Catholic" and "catholic" are different - the first refers to the Catholic Church, while the later means "universal" and "inclusive."

I understand this may be a big part of your life and your identity, but would you consider branching out to a nondenominational church or one that shares your more liberal attitudes? Maybe you would be able to find people there who agree with your stands instead of "praying for you" to agree with theirs

Christians are not all closed-minded and there are even some that do take the official stance that you agree with. I understand that you are a Catholic and you are comfortable with that label but it is difficult to be a Catholic without actually agreeing with the teachings of the Catholic church. 

If this means a lot to you I hope you can find another denomination or group of people who are open minded and not subtly full of hate and bigotry   From your posts, it sounds like you still want to be Catholic but are pretty open-minded and progressive. I'm not sure where you're located, but you might get something out of attending mass at a parish run by Jesuits. They're the most progressive religious order of priests - they're not perfect, but my university is run by Jesuits and in my four years of going to mass here (thanks, Catholic guilt) I've never heard any gay-bashing at all. I suspect most of them are either in favor of marriage equality or just don't have strong feelings about it.  I would also recommend a parish run by Paulists - my university Catholic center was run by them and I have rarely encountered such a loving, gentle, and (to my understanding) true expression of faith on a community-wide basis.   True. I went to a Paulist-run church around World AIDS Day and their collection basket money went to Gay Men's Health Crisis.

I suspect most of them are either in favor of marriage equality or just don't have strong feelings about it.  Please forgive me if this sounds odd, but as a former protestant I find it hard to understand pointing people in the direction of any catholic group in a difficult situation like the one above. While the Jesuits may be a group with a better, more tolerant culture, the fact that they're still under the umbrella of the catholic church and it's outdated beliefs makes me confused. Why support an organization that itself supports evil? I understand helping others and being progressive, but why not be progressive enough to say fuck you to the vatican and start doing the right thing. I was never catholic, so I may be stepping on toes, but the whole situation on any level above laypeople just smacks of moral cowardice and a lack of personal integrity. I really do want to get it, but it's hard. I place no blame with anyone below the priest level, but above just stinks. I based my advice to the OP on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18d92b/took_a_stand_at_my_catholic_church_group_last/c8drrp7) which indicated to me that she was a fan of progressive Catholics. Had I seen some of her later posts in this thread, I would have thought twice about making that recommendation. 

I'm not going to speak for all people of faith, but personally it's very difficult for me to not go to church on Sundays due to 22 years of Catholic guilt. Occasionally I've gone to churches of other denominations, but because of distance and laziness, I usually just go to my university's church.   I walked away from my church. I looked back twice - once to try and get the acceptance I'd never received previously, and the last time to get married.

In the years I was there, they successfully drove off a good friend (he was twice my age, but introduced me to the awesomeness of board gaming and LAN gaming!) and told me essentially that we shouldn't be friends. Like he was some kind of pedo.

I was never accepted in the youth group I was at regularly year after year. Later, I heard from one of the girls in the group that one of the most popular guys had cried about how they'd treated me.

It still hurts rather a lot, that rejection, and I doubt I'll ever stop being seriously pissed off about it.

Anyway, enough about me :)

You are what my FIL would call a "practicing Christian". While strongly religious himself, his definition is not based on what religion you subscribe to, or whether or not you believe in anything at all. No, to him, a "practicing Christian" is just a good person with love in their heart.

Good on you for standing up to them. The truth will out one of these days. I'm really sorry to hear about your friend! I might be out of luck there too, I'm dating a man 10 years older then me (who was raised zen-buddhist and is currently spiritual but generally despising of organized religion in any form as a side note). 
I always found youth groups to be terribly peppy but intellectually baseless, so I find myself liking you for *not* fitting in to that scene. (BOARD GAMES! SAVE IT FOR MARRIAGE! CORN MAZES! I LOVE JESUS! etc.)
Thank you so much for your kind words, I really appreciate them. 
The truth is out, it's just some of us aren't listening.  Yeah, I'd also characterise it as Intellectually baseless. It was terrible, and when my sister started playing D&amp;amp;D, it was all "ZOMG, teh work of teh devil!!!!". Uh-huh. I never fitted in, was socially awkward and the odd one out 100% of the time, often ignored when it came to activities outside the church etc.

I'm terribly bitter about it and won't associate with the church any more. Hahaha how dare you enjoy a fantasy game! There are no dragons in the Bible you heathen! Just ridiculous.
That's completely unfair and I sympathize with you. 
I myself am starting to feel called to disassociate with a church that encourages that such injustice and misinformation. 
However, I will be talking with my parish priest and writing an open letter to the Catholic students association (working on it now!) to stir up some hopefully meaningful debate in the mean time. 
 So not to call you out, but one of my favorite things about the Bible is that there are actually dragons in it. Mostly Revelation but fun fact anyway! :)


Revelation 12:9

And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world&#8212;he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.


Isaiah 27:1

In that day the Lord with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.


Revelation 16:13

And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. Hahaha how dare you enjoy a fantasy game! There are no dragons in the Bible you heathen! Just ridiculous.

 Well, make sure you cite the bits about loving others. :)  You're awesome and that was a gutsy move. I applaud you.

I completely get where you're coming from. I'm a liberal lapsed Catholic and I disagree with and despise the church's viewpoint on reproductive rights, gay rights, women in the church, etc. They're quite socially backward. As I'm sure you know, not all parishes buy into that dogma (I feel lucky that the church I was raised in and confirmed at is one of these; the pastor let me have a reading at my wedding that was a re-telling of story of Plato's). 

Change won't come from up top (dare I say it: fuck the pope and his cronies) but from within because of people like you who take a stand. As for those who are "praying for your lost soul," just say "Thanks for the prayers" and leave it at that.  See that's another thing I am struggling with: the community I am a party of has always been extremely loving and caring. The catholic high school I attended elected a lesbian as our student president. 
I hope and pray that the new Pope elected will be much more liberal, if not I don't see I was I can stay apart of the Catholic community wwith such a different opinion.   &amp;gt;listing a series of causes of homosexuality which included depression, an absent father, and (I kid you not), an "inability to play sports requiring hand-eye co-ordination such as baseball or soccer". As if not making the soccer team caused you to be gay.

See you missed a golden opportunity here.  I know its Goodwining and all but you could have said "aren't these the same kind of lies the Nazis used to describe the Jews to make them look less than human or inherent damaged?  Is that what the catholic church has become?  It was bad enough when the church stood by during the Holocaust but it looks like they picked up a few PR lessons from the experience."  &amp;gt;"inability to play sports requiring hand-eye co-ordination such as baseball or soccer"

Every baseball I have ever caught has been done so with my eye socket and I have more depression than the 1930's yet I still like the women. I don't like that you have to handle depression, but the way you described it is the funniest I've ever heard. &amp;gt;"inability to play sports requiring hand-eye co-ordination such as baseball or soccer"

Every baseball I have ever caught has been done so with my eye socket and I have more depression than the 1930's yet I still like the women.  While I applaud you for what you did and I think the seeds of critical thinking sprouting... this is exactly what the Catholic believes, teaches and spreads around the world as truth.  The money and time donated to Catholic churches is used not just to keep the doors to their buildings open, but to actively and purposefully "educate" and "reform" people around the world into this way of thinking.

The Catholic Church will not change this belief.  Your walking out of a talk was a small step towards reform.  However, your returning the next week and dropping your donation envelope into the collection basket is all that matters to the church.  If more Catholics stopped donating money and time and started demanding reform, only then will the Church consider change.  Until then, your money and participation will continue to expand and grow ministries that are responsible for the death of so many gay and lesbians the world over.  This is how it works, no matter how nice you are.  The message continues until the money stops. I would like to point out, that ever since the pedophilia scandals, my family has donating money SOLELY to the church building fund. You can select a box on the envelope with what you would like to donate to or if you want to just donate generally to the church. They wanted to stop giving money entirely but realized we still needed to keep the lights on. 
The only thing I donate to in my church is the soup kitchen, for the very reasons you speak about. 

And indeed the more I read, the more I realize I may be called away from the Church, even if it is my tradition. It is not a worthy tradition if it is a hurtful one. 
 &amp;gt; It is not a worthy tradition if it is a hurtful one. 

There are many other churches that have similar traditions without the history of child abuse.  If you have ever read about the Castrati singers of the church it becomes quite clear that the Catholic Church as been abusing children (boys especially) for centuries.  They would buy boys from very poor families.  The children were housed and trained as singers and castrated.  They no longer had a "gender" so to speak so they were free game to be raped, abused and kept as prisoners by the church and its leaders.  Its a pretty sad history. I was raised Catholic as well and left when I was 19 (20 years ago).  I will not even walk into a Catholic church now.  

Edited to add source:
[
"The Catholic Church's involvement in the castrato phenomenon has long been controversial, and there have recently been calls for it to issue an official apology for its role. As early as 1748, Pope Benedict XIV tried to ban castrati from churches,\[19\] but such was their popularity at the time that he realised that doing so might result in a drastic decline in church attendance."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrati)     *blows party horn at you*

You go girl!

But seriously, thank you for standing up for that. I think this is something that a lot of people (in particular the younger members of churches) are viewing as a reason for why they need to out on their own and develop their own thoughts and feelings, their own rules &amp;amp; moral guidelines to live by. Combine that with (in some cases) archaic ways of thinking about women.. it really isn't any wonder why the growth of secularism continues unabated. Gosh, I really needed that party horn, thank you so much!
Indeed one thing I am intensely thankful for is a set of parents who are amazingly both Catholic and open-minded and have always encouraged me in developing my own moral views. In fact my mom encouraged me to read about other world religions, as gave me the book Siddahartha about Buddha's life story. They both listened intensely about the whole debacle and admitted they had no rebuttals for many of my disagreements, vowing to read more about it. 
Absolutely there is no other way to get around the fact that the beliefs held by the Catholic church are in many ways archaic and often excluding.
I can only hope to stir some debate within my own community, really hash it out with my parish priest, maybe change some minds, maybe not and then continue on a path that's right for me. 
Much love thanks again.        Thank you for your courage. Churches that promote such beliefs are responsible for bullying, depression, family dysfunction, suicide and the murder of gays. If organizations had set their sights on any other demographic to batter, there would be an uproar. This 12 year veteran of catholic schools lost respect for priests/catholicism a long time ago when the very first one unzipped a little boy's pants with impunity.  We cannot control the action of one priest, but we can control how we react to it. And anyone not being fully held responsible for an action like that is disgusting, nothing else you can say. 
I appreciate your support. My parents always taught me that being silent about something that really bothers us is giving our consent to it.  Or as they said about people who were afraid to protest the Vietnam war even when our military leaders could no longer justify it:  Silence is consent.  Stay strong.     *sigh*

This sounds like what I went through when I decided to do a pro-marriage speech for my junior year speech class at my private Christian high school. Just wait until someone comes up and asks you about Sodom &amp;amp; Gomorrah.

Good job on standing up though, not just because you stood up for what you personally believe, but also because, by doing that, you stood up for anyone sitting there who does not fit the hetero-normative lifestyle. Being told that who you are attracted to is sinful and evil, even when you are sitting there, wanting to change, is damn rough. Knowing that there are people out there who simply don't hate you can be really helpful though.

Good luck on finding inner peace and whatnot. Thank you so much. I'm glad you also found the courage to speak up. I am worried about that, meeting with my parish priest tomorrow and trying to work on all the points of contention I want to hit. 
I truly appreciate it, if someone in that room was fearful to be in there because of what they were saying, I pray I made them feel safer. 
   I commend you on your restraint. I once got into an argument with a Catholic priest on the subject of gay marriage. I was rational at first, but when it was clear that we both had our opinions (mine being that gay marriage is essentially the same as straight marriage, his being that gay marriage is an abomination), I ended it by saying "fuck you, and fuck your God that would condemn people to hell for loving each other".

Not my most articulate or proud moment, and I haven't talked to him since. Sad, because he was a really nice guy besides for the whole "being a gay hating bastard" thing.    Oh jesus, that was incredibly brave and good of you.

I graduated from a private Lutheran college (I'm a gay Pagan feminist, so you can guess how that went over :P) and majored in Religion. I had a Christian Ethics professor who was just.. terrible, absolutely awful, and I never stood up to him about his views on homosexuality because I felt so alone and isolated in that class and I needed it to get my major.

What you did was amazingly brave, and this internet stranger is proud of you. Catholics (and other Christians) like you are what's going to help make a difference. I am so sorry you had to go through that (internet hug). This as I said was my first real brush with any ideas of that nature, as my family is quite liberal and all my brothers and sisters believe in marriage equality as well. I can't imagine having to go through this on a constant basis. 
Thank you. I can only hope I stirred a few consciences.  It may not feel like much, but what you did was really powerful. And while these things don't feel like they do a lot of good when they happen, every step counts.

It must be awesome to be from that sort of family. I was raised conservative Baptist in the American South, and, well... a decade ago I was a homophobe and an anti-Semite, and so were most of the people I interacted with. That sort of shit is ingrained deeply, even more so when there's a veneer of religious authority to sidestep critical thinking and conscience. I'm grateful there are liberal congregations out there, though in a somewhat bitter fashion I wonder why I never found them growing up and struggling with my gender identity and sexual orientation and only ran into them after I converted away from Christianity. But ah well. History's on our side and if my girlfriend and I have children, they'll live in a better world than I did.  this is why I left the church. I have no advice for you because in my opinion, the church is a cesspool of lies. but do what you feel is best and follow your own set of values.  I truly appreciate you trying to be polite and respectful even thought I can tell you are probably (very fairly) bitter about the Church's actions. No matter where I find myself I pray to never compromise morality and if that means I leave as well so be it.   &amp;gt;"inability to play sports requiring hand-eye co-ordination such as baseball or soccer

Welp. I'm gay. 

That said, I was raised Catholic. I am no longer Catholic. My mom who raised me in the church, also no longer considers herself Catholic. I guess we just don't jive with the church. For me, I just done work with religion. My mom really needs religion in her life though and has looked back towards Judaism which is part of her heritage. Ha! When I told that to my (also Catholic) brother he said-- "Have they even *seen* lesbians play sports? They kill me at hockey and rugby!"

Yes, I suppose I never really was a good fit with the Catholic church. I am like your Mom though I would say, I've always liked the self-reflection of religion, even if it's just sitting in mass and thinking about your week ahead. 

If I leave the Catholic church (how could I stay?) There will be a huge hole in my life. I will likely take up Buddhist meditation or volunteer somewhere.   &amp;gt;"There is NOTHING wrong with gay people."

what do you mean by this? are you aware of the fact that gay people are more likely to be depressed and diseased? what counts as something being wrong with a person if not these things? I mean that the sexual orientation of a person in itself is not sinful or wrong. The peripheral things things such as disease or depression that may come about because of this orientation does not make the orientation itself inherently sinful.

I know a few people that work there already, and we get along pretty well. Of course, mostly females work out on the floor serving and hosting, and the men in the back. Every time I go back to the kitchen while clearing tables I get a "Hey girl!" or "Damnnn, you new?" I've heard the other girls being hit on, so I know I'm not the only one, but they just laugh it off in a flirty way such as "Oh, Tyler! Stop it!" I have a boyfriend and I refuse to flirt and pretend like it's okay, but I don't want to get the reputation that I'm a bitch this soon. I'm still learning and I can't handle the anxiety when I mess something up on top of everyone thinking that I'm a bitch. I'd really appreciate any stories or advice that anyone has to share.  I also used to be a hostess at a restaurant and have dealt with some of this. For the most part, I just answered responses as literally as possible. "Damn gurl? You new?" "yes" (in as blunt a tone as possible). "You lookin' fine today!" "Thanx" (flattly). Eventually, one of 3 things happened. 1-Most realized I wasn't in the mood and backed off. 2-When it's a not busy time, I've told a few people that they cross the line a little bit (especially if they were the type to be touchy or call me pet-names). 3-I had one guy (probably one of my closest friends now) actually asked if it bothered me (it did) and he not only stopped hitting on me but also let other guys know when they were getting too flirty. To be honest, I think that last one helped the most cuz since it was someone already popular/friends with everyone, they sort of listened a little more (even though it may seem like letting someone else do your dirty work). In the end, most people want to get along with you and if you politely talk but still don't flirt, they (usually) get the message that you're not interested in flirting and won't immediately label you as a bitch. Good luck!    Are they being inappropriate? Like are they touching you or commenting on your ass or making you super uncomfortable? Or are they just being flirty? Because you can totally ignore them and not be a bitch. You don't have to flirt back but the one thing you DON"T want to do is be rude to your kitchen staff.

You don't have to flirt back at all, you can just be like "hi" or "yeah, I'm new" and leave. I wouldn't make a big deal about this if they are not being overtly sexual and harassing you.  They're definitely being more on the inappropriate side. Two guys have touched my ass and like I said, it's been less than a week.  </snippet></document><document><title>Love your body this Valentine's Day</title><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ME8sR-bnY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</url><snippet /></document><document><title>If Consent Was Really That Hard, Whiny Dudes Would Fail At Every Aspect of Life</title><url>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/06/if-consent-was-really-that-hard-whiny-dudes-would-fail-at-every-aspect-of-life/</url><snippet>   I find it hard to believe that any significant portion of the population has difficulties with consent if alcolhol isn't involved.

I don't see anything about changing portrayal of body image.  I see a picture that is just as "sexy" and idealized as the original.  I really don't get this. Oh good, I'm not the only one who thought this link made no sense. The main reason why I posted it is because the blogger links to another [site](http://eschergirls.tumblr.com/tagged/redraws) with people redrawing characters. Granted, some of them aren't the greatest. I enjoy the idea of changing the way women are portrayed in comic books with tiny waists and huge breasts. I think comic books should strive to create more realistic/well-proportioned images of women. That is all. Okay. I was confused because I looked at the link you provided and then had to find the other site. I wasn't sure if I was missing something on the original site, or whether the intent was to continue to the other site.
Thanks! I don't understand this whatsoever.  I don't see anything about changing portrayal of body image.  I see a picture that is just as "sexy" and idealized as the original.  I really don't get this.   Do that many women really read comic books?

I sort of feel like comic books are just made by males for males mainly and as such are basically just fantasies anyway.

If you're making something for x audience then you want to appeal to x audience. 

If there are more female comic fans than I'm imagining, though, that's a different story. You make a good point that comic book industry should cater to their target audience. However, I think there are quite a few of women who enjoy reading comic books too, ranging anywhere from manga to graphic novels. Perhaps, the women who enjoy comic books are not as obvious to spot as the men and/or are less numerous than the number of male fans. That's what I'm saying; if there are a lot of female fans, sure, this makes sense. But either there aren't, or they're extremely quiet about it.

I would have no problem with comic books becoming more catered towards females if there was a significant number of females interested in reading said comic books. But they need to make it known that there are, in fact, female comic readers first. And there definitely are lots of women who read comic books. I would even argue manga is more popular amongst women than American comics. They have so many different genres other than superheroes, which seems to me the common theme of DC or Marvel comics (correct me if I'm wrong though). Amongst my friends, the most popular tends to be yaoi, comedy, or mystery (e.g., *Ouran High School Host Club*, *One Piece*, *Fairy Tale*, etc.). Or perhaps, I just have a unique set of friends, which I won't argue. 

On another note, maybe if the comic books were catering towards women, then there might be more women who would be interested in them... Who knows.</snippet></document><document><title>Should I get Plan B? Any experiences with Bactrim and BC?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18fmr4/should_i_get_plan_b_any_experiences_with_bactrim/</url><snippet>I'm sure questions like this are posted a lot here but I wasn't sure where else to ask. I'm on birth control (Junel 1.5/30) but I have been on 3 day antibiotics since Sunday for a UTI. The antibiotic is called Bactrim. Today me and my boyfriend had sex twice. The first time he pulled out in time. He cleaned himself up with soap and water and we went at it again about 30 min later. The second time he came as he pulled out and may or may not have gotten some in me. Does anyone know anything about Bactrim and whether it will affect birth control? I've heard so many different things about antibiotics. As far as I know, only a few types have been proven to affect birth control but the nurse at urgent care said she wasn't sure and to use back up in case. Unfortunately, I'm really sensitive to condoms so we figured we could pull out. FWIW I haven't missed any pills in my pack aside from taking one or two 3 hours late. I just don't want to go all the way to Planned Parenthood and then deal with all the side effects of Plan B if it's unnecessary. I'm also assuming it'll be cheaper at Planned Parenthood, is that a correct assumption? My friend got it for free. Do they base off of your income or your parents income if you're 17/18?  Every antibiotic makes the birth control ineffective. You should get some plan B to be safe. It's not as though it makes the pill 100% ineffective, but how much is still unknown, and it has caused woman to get pregnant.

Edit: I would talk to a pharmacist or a doctor. Plan B can be ineffective or only have about half it's ability with certain antibiotics. Every single antibiotic has some effect on it, and each day you wait you lose some effect.  This actually isn't true. It depends on the type of antibiotic. It's safest to assume it will and use extra protection, but it's a little more complicated than that in general.

Edit: (pressed save by accident). Actually it's now thought the only ones that affect OCP are rifampin in and rifabutin and one or two other uncommon ones. 

Bactrim shouldn't affect either the pill or plan b in theory. Every antibiotic makes the birth control ineffective. You should get some plan B to be safe. It's not as though it makes the pill 100% ineffective, but how much is still unknown, and it has caused woman to get pregnant.

i'm a lot more pissed about sports being a financial leach on universities. i wish i could go to a university that's renowned for it's STEM departments without having to pay an elevated tuition just to cover a bunch of idiot jocks' free scholarships. why the hell should athletic aptitude ever be rewarded with free education? does that benefit society more than giving those scholarships to real *scholars*, or is it just to maintain profits for those who own college team franchises? What a corrupt allocation of resources. harrumph. &amp;gt; without having to pay an elevated tuition just to cover a bunch of idiot jocks' free scholarships.

Wow. I get that you don't want to pay athletic fees if you aren't interested in athletics, but just calling all athletes "idiot jocks" is a huge, unfair, generalization. There are lots of athletes that are incredibly smart, and spend lots of time on school in addition to athletics, and would be unable to attend college (or as good of a college) without the scholarships they receive.

&amp;gt; why the hell should athletic aptitude ever be rewarded with free education?

I'm not sure why lots of things should be rewarded with scholarships. I have a scholarship because of where my father works, why should I get part of my education paid for because my dad works at a certain company. One of my friends has a scholarship because she keeps her money at a certain bank, why is that grounds for a scholarship?

&amp;gt; does that benefit society more than giving those scholarships to real scholars

Honestly, it just sounds as if you are upset that other people are getting money for doing things where they are better than you (sports), and you want the money to go to something where you are better than some of them (academics).

&amp;gt; or is it just to maintain profits for those who own college team franchises?

Nobody owns college teams, there isn't anybody who runs these teams for a profit other than the university. Coaches make a living off of them, but they are there because scholarships exist, not the other way around. instead of attacking my character, could you provide a reason why giving free educations to good athletes is a better allocation of resources than giving a free education to people that excel in academics? i really don't see how it benefits society besides entertaining fans of organized sports.</snippet></document><document><title>This is one brave woman. How can we support her attempt to change the NY definition of rape?</title><url>http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/teacher_raped_by_nypd_cop_goes_publ.php</url><snippet>  Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape. 

In Canada, we did away legally with the word "rape" and these sorts of crimes are categorized as sexual assault. [Under the Criminal Code of Canada, "Consent is defined as a voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question." Consent that is obtained through pressure, coercion, force, or threats of force is not voluntary consent.](http://www.ualberta.ca/dept/health/public_html3/healthinfo/SACAN.HTM)

I think that the US should follow Canada's lead on this matter.   &amp;gt; Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape.

By my own personal definition of rape, I don't know if I would agree with this.

The upside of what you suggest is that it puts other types of sexual assault, which may be equally traumatic, on equal status with penetrative rape.  The downside is that the word "rape" tends to elicit a more intense emotional reaction in people, so re-defining the whole shebang as "sexual assault" may be seen as minimizing the severity of the crime. I agree that taking the word "rape" out of the picture may be seen as minimizing the severity of the crime, but on the other hand grouping unwanted sexual contact under the umbrella of "sexual assault" is more inclusive. It gives equal legitimacy in the eyes of the law to the victims of rape, regardless of where or how they were forced to engage in sexual activity.   &amp;gt; It gives equal legitimacy in the eyes of the law to the victims of rape, regardless of where or how they were forced to engage in sexual activity.

To clarify, may I ask exactly what you are defining "rape" as in this instance? I'm using the definition of sexual assault as explained in the link given previously to describe rape.  I didn't see a specific definition given there, but it sounds like NY law limits the term "rape" to only vaginal penetration, not oral/anal penetration such as was forced on Ms. Cuomo.

Personally, I'd rather support her suggestion (expanding the definition of rape to include penetration of any type) instead of re-categorizing all of those actions as "sexual assault" as you suggested.  That way we are able to give equal legitimacy to all victims without losing the emotional impact of that particular word. I understand your reluctance to let go of the word "rape" but I also view adopting the term "sexual assault" as more inclusive and lending equal legitimacy to all victims of sexual assault, regardless of the nature of the criminal act.  I guess I'm not sure I understand your thought process.

Not all people who are sexually assaulted are raped (I am using the term rape here to mean penetration). However, all people who are raped are sexually assaulted (since sexual assault is the larger umbrella term).

I do see instances of non-vaginal rape being minimized because it is termed sexual assault instead of rape (as happened with Ms. Cuomo). I think re-defining the term rape fixes the second problem, but getting rid of the term rape only exacerbates it.

Do you feel that victims of sexual-assault-which-is-not-rape experience lack of legitimacy?  (That is, above and beyond the rape culture which tends to minimize sexual assault of all types?)

 In Canada, there are [degrees of sexual assault](http://antiviolenceproject.org/info/sexual-assault-laws-in-canada) based on the level of force used against the victim. 

This link better clarifies that the *"...term &#8220;sexual assault&#8221; is more broad in its application than &#8220;rape&#8221;; as such, the law now acknowledges that other forms of unwanted sexual activity are as damaging to survivors as forced sexual intercourse. In addition, sexual assault laws are no longer gender-biased, and recognize that people of all genders can be victims (and perpetrators), and that they should all be provided with equal treatment by the law."*

&amp;gt;Do you feel that victims of sexual-assault-which-is-not-rape experience lack of legitimacy? (That is, above and beyond the rape culture which tends to minimize sexual assault of all types?)

In the USA, obviously they do, as the article at hand makes quite clear.

Eliminating the use of the word "rape" also silences the asshats who wonder whether it is "legitimate" or not. Sexual assault is sexual assault, whether penetration of any kind happened or if you were "only" groped. I don't agree that the term minimizes the severity of the crime. We are still free to add adjectives, such as "vicious" or "extremely violent", and level of violence will be taken into account at a sentencing hearing. The "severity" should have no weight in deciding whether or not a crime occurred. It is a violation if you did not consent to it and that should be the deciding factor in a guilty verdict. &amp;gt; The "severity" should have no weight in deciding whether or not a crime occurred

What world do you live in?

So if I'm out dancing with my gf in a club and some drunk person (male or female) grabs my tits, you want that to be 'rape' ? and hard jail time?

or i grind into some man on the dance floor (without asking "consent") but there I am, grinding my pubic mound and tits into him, by your way, since 'he did not give consent', this is rape and I go to jail?

Think before you type hon If some drunk person grabs my breasts on the dance floor without my consent, the crime of sexual assault **has** occurred. That person should be found guilty. The "severity" of it will be considered at the sentencing hearing and will determine how much jail time, if any.

If a person is drunk, are his/her actions excusable? Think before you type. Depends on the jurisdiction in question. In NY for example the crime of forcible touching occurred.  If some drunk person grabs my breasts on the dance floor without my consent, the crime of sexual assault **has** occurred. That person should be found guilty. The "severity" of it will be considered at the sentencing hearing and will determine how much jail time, if any.

If a person is drunk, are his/her actions excusable? Think before you type. fine, erase the drunk part.

So EVERY time you have done ANYTHING involving another human, you have asked for consent? For every action? Yes, I ask my husband if he's in the mood.

Let's put it this way. If you ground your lady bits up against a guy on the dance floor and he tells you to stop, did you keep doing it? If so, that is sexual assault. of course I do, but i don't really 'ask' first, it's two strangers dancing in a nightclub, one does certain things assuming they are ok. But I don't verbally say "hello nice looking man who I am dancing with, may I grind my lady parts into your groin"; so by your definition, I am committing sexual assault or even rape. I believe dragnflye was very clear in articulating that the word "rape" does not describe your hypothetical. However, if you press your lady parts up against someone without asking first and they take offense and decide to press charges against you, sexual assault would be a very appropriate charge. &amp;gt; The "severity" should have no weight in deciding whether or not a crime occurred

Think before you type hon You are of course correct.  There are different levels of sexual assault just like there are different levels of rape in most jurisdictions.   This is how the US works.   It is also why we have 1st, 2nd, etc degree murder .

The problem is the person you are responding to is confusing the legal term sexual assault with the dictionary definition. &amp;gt; The "severity" should have no weight in deciding whether or not a crime occurred

Person X knocks me down, and steals $200 worth of food I am holding to feed her starving children at home.

Person Y knocks me down and steals my wallet which has $200 in it to buy drugs for himself.

Both stole $200

Both committed the same crime "Theft of assets with value of $200"

So your logic indicates no other factors should come into play?

Both just do the same jail sentence?

I would not wish to live in your world. Good bye &amp;gt; Both just do the same jail sentence?

No, that's my point? Both people committed a crime. If someone stole 200 and another person stole 2000, should the "severity" have any bearing on whether or not that person committed a crime? The person who committed the "lesser" crime (200 dollars) still committed a crime. The severity has nothing to do with it. I am a human and not a machine; thus, I would slap the wrist of the person who stole my $200 of food to feed their starving children; and arrest/jail the person who stole my $200 to buy drugs.

It's calling being a human being and having an understanding for WHY someone did something bad-wrong. &amp;gt; It's calling being a human being and having an understanding for WHY someone did something bad-wrong.

Do thieves generally tell you why they're stealing your money before they do it? I don't know about you, but if someone steals from me, I'm going to report the crime instead of pondering why they stole and deciding that it was probably for good reason so I should just let them have it. Also, there is no good reason for someone to sexually assault another person. Sexual assault doesn't feed anyone. I am a human and not a machine; thus, I would slap the wrist of the person who stole my $200 of food to feed their starving children; and arrest/jail the person who stole my $200 to buy drugs.

It's calling being a human being and having an understanding for WHY someone did something bad-wrong. I think that goes more into the sentencing part, instead of deciding whether the crime was committed/arresting.  

Judges will take information like that into consideration when sentencing--including priors, circumstance, etc.  

Or, hopefully, there's a nice DA that will take a plea for something lighter. I am a human and not a machine; thus, I would slap the wrist of the person who stole my $200 of food to feed their starving children; and arrest/jail the person who stole my $200 to buy drugs.

It's calling being a human being and having an understanding for WHY someone did something bad-wrong. Why should the drug addict receive a harsher sentence than the desperate parent? The drug addict has an illness and there are other options for the desperate parent, such as food banks, welfare, etc. The point is a crime occurred, regardless of who did it or why.   &amp;gt; Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape.

I think that the US should follow Canada's lead on this matter.  The Canadian law also says there has been no consent when:

&amp;gt; "the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity."

I wonder if that expansive definition always comports with what people consider to be crimes. Consider this example based on a somewhat similar case in California:

A boyfriend and girlfriend are having consensual sex. While she is on top of him, the girlfriend says "stop, I want to light some candles." The boyfriend replies "no, that's stupid" and continues normal intercourse from underneath her. She doesn't try to get off him and he uses no special force, intimidation, etc.

In the actual California case (which also had a broad definition of rape) the guy was convicted of rape. I think a similar result would be reached under Canadian law.

Even more stark examples could be found with other forms of sexual assault. Imagine a teenage boyfriend and girlfriend fooling around before class. The girlfriend says "ok no more, I don't want to be late to class." In an effort to persuade her to stay, the boyfriend keeps touching her sexually and says "just a couple more minutes." Should that be a crime? It too seems like it might be under the Canadian law. The Canadian law also says there has been no consent when:

So if somebody grabs your ass against your will, that's rape?  I wasn't aware that ass-grabbing constituted sex. It would probably be considered assault, period.  Ass-grabbing certainly can be a sexual activity. Not in the context that it was presented in the previous question, it wasn't. The context in which ass-grabbing was presented did not preclude the possibility of it being sexual in nature.  In fact, given we're having a conversation about sexual assault, I'd say that the context tends to suggest that particular possibility. This is the comment to which I responded: *So if somebody grabs your ass against your will, that's rape?*

There's nothing said there about it being sexual in nature. It's just described as an ass-grabbing, and the person asked if it qualified as *rape.* It pretty obviously doesn't. 

So *no,* the context does *not* suggest that particular possibility.  As I said in my last post, the context of the entire thread suggests that possibility, as it is a thread about sexual assault.

With respect to that particular question, it doesn't specifically suggest a sexual connotation to the ass-grabbing, but I never claimed it did.  What I said is that the context given for the ass-grabbing does not preclude a sexual connotation.

To put it into a clear, simple example, it's as if somebody asked the question "Are cars blue?" and you responded "cars are not blue", to which I replied "cars can be blue".  Claiming that some cars are blue is not the same as claiming that every car is blue, it's a refutation of the claim that no cars are blue. &amp;gt;With respect to that particular question, it doesn't specifically suggest a sexual connotation to the ass-grabbing

The specific question by that poster made it clear that they were asking if ass-grabbing = *rape.* Clearly it does not. I was responding to that question and only that question and to re-frame it as if I were responding to the thread in general is unreasonable.  I wasn't aware that ass-grabbing constituted sex. It would probably be considered assault, period.  I wasn't aware that "any kind of sexual activity" only meant sex. &amp;gt; Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape.

So if somebody grabs your ass against your will, that's rape?  That's sexual harassment, not sexual assault. &amp;gt; Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape.

So if somebody grabs your ass against your will, that's rape?  [deleted] Grabbing an ass isn't sexual?  So if your boss grabs your ass every day that's not sexual harassment?  [deleted] Yeah I'm sure the guy at the bar who grabs your ass is doing it for medical reasons. 

What are you arguing again?  [deleted] Several times in this thread you've used the term "torture" to describe rape, and I really disagree with that usage.  Torture carries extremely strong connotations of *purposefully causing pain*, and there are many, many instances where rapists cause no pain whatsoever.

Referring to rape victims as having been "tortured with a penis" runs the risk of reinforcing the incorrect stereotype that "real rape" involves violence and pain.  It downplays (or even delegitimizes) the experiences of people who have experienced "date rape" or "coercion rape", which is **every bit as legitimate** as rape that is intended to cause pain. [deleted] [deleted] why does that distinction matter?  [deleted] Being forced to engage in any kind of sexual activity against one's will is rape.

That idea falls apart when confronted with the wide range of human sexual activity.

I'm pretty sure in this instance "sexual activity" excludes any non-physical actions.  Is there any particular reason why it matters whether a particular crime is called "sexual assault" instead of "rape"?  I mean, the guy got 75 years for sexual assault, so clearly its a pretty harsh accusation.  I started the article thinking "he got off" ? wtf

When I read where the sentence was 75 years, I again said wtf.

I am female and had been raped in college (broken ribs, wake up in hospital bed) so believe me, Rapists need jail time, there is no doubt of that. But 75 years seems insane.  The article says he was an off-duty cop, though, so he might've used his badge or position of power as a police officer to coerce her.

So (assuming you are a straight female), by your view, I am sure sometimes in your life, you had sex or sexual contact with some male before he gave verbal consent.

Thus, that is rape (by your defination)

Can you explain what purpose jail has for people convicted of rape? In that case, it is separating them from the rest of society.  Prison is not seen as rehab (rehab is doubtful in most of the US anyway but that's another topic) -- it is seen as protecting the public. It *might* be seen as being a deterrence (ie. another off duty cop sees this and thinks twice about raping someone).  Yes, i know that there is doubt about the effectiveness of sentencing in deterring crime. But, this is the other angle society would use.  Sure. But how do you explain the OPs original claim that:

&amp;gt;But 75 years seems insane.

Seems like a suitable sentence if the only purpose of prison is to separate rapists from non-rapists. Is there any particular reason why it matters whether a particular crime is called "sexual assault" instead of "rape"?  I mean, the guy got 75 years for sexual assault, so clearly its a pretty harsh accusation.  I imagine it is a matter of principle. The word 'rape' carries a much harsher and nearly universal hated connotation. Sexual assault could be anything from forcible gang penetrative rape to someone taking a picture of your feet.

If you go with 'sexual assault' instead of 'rape' you risk having your trauma belittled. And while this man got 75 years, others probably get far less because the jury didn't think sexual assault was as harsh or severe as rape. I think you're belittling the intelligence of juries.  They are told the exact parameters of hte crime with their jury instructions.  Is there any particular reason why it matters whether a particular crime is called "sexual assault" instead of "rape"?  I mean, the guy got 75 years for sexual assault, so clearly its a pretty harsh accusation.  The 75 is for three counts of predatory sexual assault. If it were one count (ie one instance of anal penetration), I doubt the sentence would be as long as a rape conviction under the same circumstances. (Not an expert in criminal law, though, I could be completely wrong.) Quoting another poster: " basically he was convicted of a crime (class A-II felony) worse than Rape in the First degree(class B felony), which includes the requirement of committing rape in the first degree or aggravated sexual assault (also class B)."   Wow, I had many misconceptions about sexual assault laws. So since vaginal penetration is a requirement for rape, does that mean that a woman cannot be charged with rape since she does not have a penis? If you penetrate someone with something other than a penis, does that count as rape too?  &amp;gt;So since vaginal penetration is a requirement for rape, does that mean that a woman cannot be charged with rape since she does not have a penis?

This is how it works in the UK. Women cannot rape others in the UK. In Scotland women can be charged with rape, but only if they penetrate someone with an object without consent. Under Sexual Offences Act 2003 any vaginal, anal or oral penetration without consent or reasonable belief of consent (yeah that part's still a bit iffy) is rape regardless of what was used to penetrate, so a woman can be charged with rape. This also will mean that using sex toys or fingers is rape. 

Its a good move forward apart from the reasonable belief thing. I can't remember the case name of the top of my head but several men were not convicted with rape as they had believed that she was actually consenting. Her husband had said for them to do it and said " she may say no, but she's a kinky bitch that way." So even though she did shout and scream no and for them to stop they believed that it was all an act based on what her husband had said to them.

Eliminating reasonable belief would make BDSM practically illegal. [Consent is not an affirmative defense to battery in many places, such as the UK.] (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM_and_the_law#section_1) As such, S&amp;amp;M play is technically illegal. In the states, I know Boston's BDSM clubs are always on shaky legal footing because of this.  Wow, I had many misconceptions about sexual assault laws.

So since vaginal penetration is a requirement for rape, does that mean that a woman cannot be charged with rape since she does not have a penis? If you penetrate someone with something other than a penis, does that count as rape too?  That's one of the big problems with getting accurate statistics.  There are 50 state and a federal definition.  Only last year did the [FBI change it's definition](http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/attorney-general-eric-holder-announces-revisions-to-the-uniform-crime-reports-definition-of-rape) from only penis+vagina rape.  It still requires the victim to be penetrated, which makes a lot of male sexual assault victims, who do not fit that definition, upset. &amp;gt; It still requires the victim to be penetrated

No, it doesn't.  It says penetration occurs, but not which party is necessarily the rapist.  The verbiage goes,

"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim." &amp;gt; It still requires the victim to be penetrated

"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."

I initially read that as "The penetration...of another person, without consent", whereas you are reading it "The penetration...by a sex organ, without consent."  Stupid English. I don't understand your interpretation.  "of another person" clearly modifies "organ."  There's nothing else it could be modifying.  It'd need at least another comma for it to modify penetration.

Be supportive of people who have experienced this, and give them strength to tell their story.  Laws regarding rape need to completely remove the reproductive mindset. The newer generation of laws which define it as any forced penetration are a step in the right direction, but still exclude rape victims who are forced or coerced into performing sex acts without being penetrated themselves. While we're at it, we need to up the ante on sexual assault until it stops being (with regards to sentencing and criminal perception), "only sexual assault," and instead takes into account the full repercussions of what occurred.  &amp;gt;While we're at it, we need to up the ante on sexual assault until it stops being (with regards to sentencing and criminal perception), "only sexual assault," and instead takes into account the full repercussions of what occurred.

I'm a bit confused about what it is specifically that you're advocating here.  Are you saying that you think all sex crimes should carry equivalent sentencing requirements/guidelines? I'm more saying that right now sexual assault laws (in some states) are written and interpreted as such that a person who commits sexual assault, even of a grave nature, only receives probation, a fine, and/or a very short jail sentence. There is a perceived diminishment of severity between rape and sexual assault, even though the difference between the two in many places is simply whether penetration of the victim occurred. In this case the sentencing matched the severity of the crime but in many cases there is a disparity.

I actually don't know how helpful it is to distinguish and have actions fall under certain umbrellas because every case is very different. The variety in sentencing frequently does not match the severity of the crime and perhaps a productive review could help. According to [this paper](http://www.drc.ohio.gov/web/Reports/Ten_Year_Recidivism.pdf) the recidivism rate for people jailed for sexual assault is 8% (for another sexual assault) within 10 years. That seems high to me, and indicates that something in the system is broken--although with the system we have that doesn't come as much surprise. That's actually among the lowest recidivism rates for any category of crime, I believe.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism#Recidivism_rates

&amp;gt;*Released prisoners with the highest rearrest rates were robbers (70.2%), burglars (74.0%), larcenists (74.6%), motor vehicle thieves (78.8%), those in prison for possessing or selling stolen property (77.4%), and those in prison for possessing, using, or selling illegal weapons (70.2%).

&amp;gt;*Within 3 years, 2.5% of released rapists were arrested for another rape, and 1.2% of those who had served time for homicide were arrested for homicide. These are the lowest rates of re-arrest for the same category of crime.

In this case in this jurisdiction he was convicted of a harsher crime than rape.  He got more time than he would have if he had been convicted of rape. 

I doubt there was any diminishment.   Something is funky about this story. He was convicted of predatory sexual assault. Here is the predatory sexual assault code in NY

&amp;gt;S 130.95 Predatory sexual assault.
A person is guilty of predatory sexual assault when he or she commits
the crime of rape in the first degree, criminal sexual act in the first
degree, aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree, or course of sexual
conduct against a child in the first degree, as defined in this article,
and when: 1. In the course of the commission of the crime or the immediate
flight therefrom, he or she:
(a) Causes serious physical injury to the victim of such crime; or
(b) Uses or threatens the immediate use of a dangerous instrument; or
2. He or she has engaged in conduct constituting the crime of rape in
the first degree, criminal sexual act in the first degree, aggravated
sexual abuse in the first degree, or course of sexual conduct against a
child in the first degree, as defined in this article, against one or
more additional persons; or
3. He or she has previously been subjected to a conviction for a
felony defined in this article, incest as defined in section 255.25 of
this chapter or use of a child in a sexual performance as defined in
section 263.05 of this chapter.




So basically he was convicted of a crime (class A-II felony) worse than Rape in the First degree(class B felony), which includes the requirement of committing rape in the first degree or aggravated sexual assault (also class B) And she is complaining he wasn't convicted of a lessor crime? (Even though he also pled guilty on the lessor crime later.)

Yeah something is a bit weird with this article.   I understand "rape is rape" Legally speaking there are various types of rapes of course, but nevertheless rape is rape.

However if groping is considered the same as rape I wonder how a gang raped person would feel if they are told by a person who had their ass pinched that they understand what they went through. I would imaging many would be quite offended. I don't see anyone indicating that groping should be rape.  Groping is already considered sexual assault.  Instead, someone who is anally raped by a gang should have the same justice as someone who is vaginally raped by a gang.  There are some posters saying that someone forced to perform oral (or any other sex act) on a gang should have the justice of other gang rape. 
There are some posters from Canada stating that Canada no longer uses the term "rape". Instead everything falls under sexual assault and there are various degrees of sexual assault.  This would be similar to the difference between murder 1, murder 2, manslaughter and assault  Hmm I'm assuming, if this passes, this is going to drastically change the way male-on-male rape is legally classified, from sexual assault to rape. And yet there is no mention or support of this so far in the men's rights movement. Actually, the men's rights movement has been advocating for significant changes to the legal definition of rape for quite some time now, both to include oral and anal penetration, as well as including "being made to penetrate".  I'll see if I can dig up some links in a bit, but it may take a bit of hunting as I generally avoid men's rights forums. I meant this specific case. Why aren't they supporting this woman's cause? Also, re: avoiding, I'm with you. How do you know that they aren't?  I'd love an explanation for where you're drawing that conclusion from, or I suppose I'll just have to take your word for it. I don't spend much time surveying the men's rights community. It's recent news, when I first made my comment I checked the subreddit and the other discussions tab to see if had been posted. It hadn't then, but someone posted it now. There are three comments, and it's downvoted. No one is saying anything about the actual issue and how it could benefit their purported causes.

http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/18cex4/teacher_raped_by_nypd_cop_wants_albany_to_change/ /r/MensRights is definitely the shallow end of the pool when it comes to the men's rights community.  It's the equivalent of /r/atheism in my eyes.  For the same reason, it's no more fair to judge all of the men's rights community for the sort of bad behavior that goes on in /r/mensrights than it is to judge all atheists for the shitshow that occurs in /r/atheism.

A single subreddit isn't really enough to demonstrate an argument from exhaustion.

Also, that title is awful and the post deserved to be downvoted because of it.  "Teacher raped by NYPD cop wants Albany to change rape laws. Maybe now she can empathize with male rape victims. (x-post from r/politics)" is such absurd troll-bait, it's no big surprise it was downvoted to oblivion.

Looking at the three comments in that thread so far, they all seem to be perfectly reasonable discussion, but three comments aren't even really a drop in the bucket.    [deleted] I disagree with your chosen semantics here.  A crime is a type of activity, whether it be bank robbery, check fraud, or sexual assault.  Also, if an act is of a sexual nature for an involved party, then it becomes a sexual act.

You may prefer a different definition of those particular words, but there's a general consensus understanding of what they mean which is fairly straightforward, and which seems to be quite distinct from your own. [deleted]  As an aside...

I like the quote from an article [two links in](http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/gunpoint_rape_cop_gets_another_10_y.php):

&amp;gt;Pena's lawyer, who once acknowledged his client committed an "unforgivable" crime, said, "He obviously realizes he has destroyed his life. And that he has affected a young woman's life, and disappointed his family and his police department. He's a broken man. But he has some hope that he will not be carried out of prison in a box."

*Disclosure: I may lack first-hand knowledge of the penal system.. but my Most Interesting Friend has ten years' experience as a guest in some of New York State's least reputable facilities. The following insights come partly from him and partly from other sources.*

This guy is an ex-cop. That by itself is bad ju-ju. Granted, he would normally be put into a separate wing for high-profile targets.. but considering that he's a sex criminal, they may choose to waive that courtesy in this case. On the inside.. there's a pecking order.. and cops are instant targets. Sex criminals are instant targets. (Pedophiles are dogmeat.) But a cop who's a sex criminal?! The only way he still breathes is if he's given special treatment. [*edit:removed some statements which triggered, mea culpa*] I've been fortunate enough to have not been the victim of this crime, I know a few people who have been.. but I think rapists should receive certain special punishments. Like "head on a pike" punishments.) 

 An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 

Either we trust our justice system to mete out appropriate punishment, or we adjust the justice system. Taking pride in how abusive our system is once you've been convicted does a disservice to the incarcerated, many of whom are non-violent offenders.  I know how bad the justice system is towards many whose crimes are non-violent. The justice system in the US is a series of very bad patches over what was a good system at first. There should be a serious overhaul of the system in general. I agree with you. 

And for the vast majority of crimes, rehabilitation is potentially possible. My Most Interesting Friend's crime did involve him ending the life of another person. I've known this man for about six years, and he is, hands-down, an amazing, nice, kind, gentle guy who just did something, well, fuck stupid when he was young, and he's paying the price for his idiotic acts. Drugs offenders, they can recover from their addictions. Property criminals can not steal or tag or break or burn. 

But sex criminals.. 

It's just that.. this particular crime.. it's heinous. I have no desire for violence.. save for rare cases like this waste of flesh. I know too many people who have been on the wrong side of a rapist's attention.. and despite my efforts to try to purge all the violence out of me, there are a few places where I have some left. Despite my efforts to eliminate hatred from my soul, I truly despise such people. (And since transition, my emotional range has expanded greatly.. ironically, the depths of loathing I have for such wastes of meat are so much greater than they used to be.)  

I really try. I do. But the idea that someone inside will probably wreak great vengeance and furious anger upon him as an unwritten part of his  *reward* for his atrocious acts.. it brings me a little relief, I guess, would be closest for the emotion I feel. (Admittedly, and I know this is hard to believe, I still struggle for words at times.)  I can certainly relate to the feeling. However, given that sometimes we get things wrong and send innocent people to prison - we have to try and do our best to make the system humane. Strict and humane are fully compatible, and I believe that being deprived of your freedom for 15-75 years (assuming he'll likely be paroled at some point) is a reasonable balance between what our emotions tell us he deserves and what humane treatment in an imperfect world requires of us.  I fully agree - I would much rather let an guilty person go free than send an innocent to prison. 

In this case, though, there's no question of guilt. He actually plea bargained for the 75 year sentence... which means he was up for probably getting much much more.  (While, based on what I can see, theoretically 15 years is the minimum he can serve before parole is potentially possible, the face that the crime was aggravated, plus the abuse of the public trust, will probably make that number a fantasy.) 

Part of the question of incarceration is whether the person is a threat to society. With sex assaulters, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Sex offender registration laws, for example, are exceptionally blunt tools; I know. They should be reworked into logical schemas, especially considering how many more mandatory registrations are going to come down the pike thanks to dumb teens sexting. (Seriously - a teenage sext equals child pornography charges equals sex offender.) 

Even if there was a means of rehabilitation possible for this pile of defective genetic code, I still have no sympathy for the guy for how he went about his crime. He was a cop. He used the color of authority to press himself on her: he used his service weapon and his badge. 

I really really am compassionate to almost everyone.. but I can't find anything for this person. If that's a failure in me, I acknowledge that character flaw.  As an aside...

 Let's please not start glorifying sexual assault in our prison system. I removed the statements. I apologize. 

(This subject.. really sets me off.)   What about charging men with raping men, or women raping men? Why isn't she fighting to have the definition include forced oral/ penile contact for men? Isn't redefining rape to include oral and anal sex going to open up the definition for a lot of male victims? Yes - it will. But it didn't state if she was going to try to change the definition about forced penile penetration, which is currently unremarked in most rape laws/ definitions. ...yeah, because she's using her specific case to argue against legal precedent, and in there was no forced penetration in her case. No I mean, forced vaginal penetration is in the definition but forcing a man to pentrate something with his penis is not in the definition. I understand what you meant. Forced penile penetration was not a part of her case. Yes, I'm aware, but if she's going to fight to have the law changed, it should include equal premises for both genders. I wonder what it would take to have that definition included in a law, as it's hard (not impossible) to prove. [deleted] What about charging men with raping men, or women raping men?

i'm fifteen and can easily put one finger into my vagina. Basically whenever i put in a tampon though, i can only get JUST the tampon in. When I go to push it further with my finger, i can probably get it in about one cm more until I feel this nauseating pain like it's hitting a wall and will NOT go further.  I think it's hitting my cervix? Does it hitting my cervix mean my vagina is really short? Or is it just hitting some kine of muscle? D:

They leak really easily and I think it's because of this. If I clench up my vagina, I can physically feel it inside of me. Also sometimes if I sit down too hard I feel it...

I have the same issue with mini ones, like the smallest you can get. Am I angling it wrong or...?

ALSO.  I put Vaseline on the end of one of them, about 30 mins ago, and it went in a bit better but it still felt like it was hitting my cervix. And now I'm worried that Vaseline can cause yeast infections or something :( I didn't use much, just a thin layer on the end, and this is the first time I've ever done that, but I'm kinda scared.

Thanks if you read this :) I know it's long but I am worried   This happened to me when I was 15 or so, too.  I never figured out if it was a hymen issue or an angle issue, but I used pads for a couple of years instead and when I was 16 or 17 I tried again and magically they worked.  If you're getting pain it's likely to be that your hymen is still at least partially intact.  You can go to the doctor to get it cut in some places, or if not it'll break in time.

Do you have access to pads or anything of the sort? Also, I wouldn't worry about a little Vaseline.  People put much more problematic things in their vaginas without issue.  It would be good to keep an eye on things and go to the doctor if you have any symptoms, but I wouldn't start worrying until then. Seconding the pads. Tampons hurt for my first 3 years of menstruation but then it all worked out.  Have you tried putting it in at an angle? Also, vaseline is okay. Real lube is better, though. I'm not entirely certain what angle I'm meant to put it in at...

Hello!  There is something goin' on *down there* and I can't see a medical professional until tomorrow afternoon and I am looking for some advice for how to make it until then a little more comfortably.  My lady parts are driving me crazy, super-itchy and a little bit burny, and wiping feels seriously not good.  It feels like a rash all up my vagina around the opening, going over the perineum a little bit, and up the labia.  Is there some thing I can do to make this feel better so I can stand it for the next 24 hours?  I have a lot to do and is beyond uncomfortable and distracting.   Any recommendations?  Creams or something I can buy?  Cold compress?  Morphine?

Thanks a bunch, yours in Ladyhood  Try babywipes or kleenex instead of TP, and consider using a Summers Eve style wash specifically for ladybits.  Usually baby wipes are like rose petals, but with this one they make the burning a bit worse.  Thanks for the advice, just putting this here so others know.  Never tried the Summer's Eve, but a nice wash seems like it would feel awesome. Have you tried the sensitive skin wipes? The normal ones- especially by Huggies- tend to make rashes and irritations worse, especially with sensitive skin. We switched to the sensitive skin ones and so far, so good!

I've got an off brand version of the Summer's Eve stuff, and it really makes a massive difference. It's not too expensive either!    Benadryl or similar anti-histamine (taken orally) may help with the itching/burning you've got going on. Any sort of itch-cream (found in the first aid section) or vagisil anti itch cream will probably help.  Lastly, you can get adult wet wipes in the toilet paper section.   Whenever I have itchiness and general unpleasantness down below a quick shower with tepid or cool water *without* soaping my vag really really seems to help. And then patting dry with a washcloth. Hope you feel better soon!    </snippet></document><document><title>Funny short movie that's a PSA for heart attack symptoms in women </title><url>http://www.surreywellness.com/chiropractic/go-for-red-women-premiere-short-film-just-a-little-heart-attack/</url><snippet>  </snippet></document><document><title>UPDATE #2 -Decided to sit Thanksgiving out with my family, because I'm not ready to see my heroin using sister. Feeling shitty about it</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18e2ii/update_2_decided_to_sit_thanksgiving_out_with_my/</url><snippet>[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/132k4p/decided_to_sit_thanksgiving_out_with_my_family/)

[Update #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/140bda/updatedecided_to_sit_thanksgiving_out_with_my/)

Hello again. Some good and bad news since my last update. Bad news, she has since been charged with possessing paraphernalia a couple of months ago. The good news, as of yesterday she wants to go to in-patient rehab. My parents are trying to get her on the plane to go Thursday, the facility she's going to only takes people two days a week so that's the soonest she can get in. Hopefully my parents and their lawyer can convince the court to push her court date back until she's done with rehab, because as it stands she's going to be in treatment when she's supposed to be at court. 

My mom is already panicking that the treatment facility is a scam in the middle of the ghetto, so I've been nominated to take my sister to the airport and someone from the facility is picking her up. My sister is already freaking out about leaving her (at least) emotionally abusive boyfriend, and says she wants "closure". I can understand wanting to send one letter once she's in rehab, but before that I don't think it's a good idea. I'm hoping my mom doesn't cave to her wanted to see him one last time, since she already told her "that maybe once day a few years down the road when they're both clean it will work." 

I talked to my sister for the first time since June/July yesterday, and while it was great, it's hard for me to shake the thought in the back of my mind that she's going to bail and everything will go back to how it was. I'm extremely nervous that she's going to bail at the last minute at the airport, and what I'll do in that situation. Do I take her back home? Do I leave her there? Do I beg for her to get on the plane?

So hopefully my story is helping other people going through the same thing, and I will give another update after Thursday.   </snippet></document><document><title>Is the term MILF derogatory? </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18enxi/is_the_term_milf_derogatory/</url><snippet>I'm writing a speech about MILF's, the term, what it means, and whether it is a compliment or a derogatory term. I have a basic idea of where I want to go with it, but I would love to have 2X's opinions on the matter as I have mad respect for you ladies and I want to see if you guys have a view that I haven't thought of. 

So what are your thoughts on the term MILF?       Yes, because it reduces a person to an object, little more than a fleshlight. It's horribly offensive. 

Surprised at the downvotes without comments explaining why here. I didn't downvote, but the reason for the downvotes is because saying you would like to fuck someone doesn't make that person out to be an object.  Saying it does, insinuates that feeling sexual attraction toward someone objectifies them, which is just not true.   Yes, because it reduces a person to an object, little more than a fleshlight. It's horribly offensive. 

Surprised at the downvotes without comments explaining why here. I find your comparison to a fleshlight interesting. Does that mean when a girl sees a hot guy and says she wants to fuck him she's reducing him to a dildo?  If she describes him as an object - BILF (Boy-I'd-Like-To-Fuck), then yes! Yeah, I disagree. Whilst it is common knowledge that milf is an acronym for mother Id like to fuck, I feel that the sexual imagery is no longer a dominant component in the meaning of the term. Rather, when someone is described as a milf, it means they are an attractive older woman. While I would agree at one point it was offensive, the reasons for that no longer apply as the term has been re-appropriated imo...  &amp;gt;Whilst it is common knowledge that milf is an acronym for mother Id like to fuck, I feel that the sexual imagery is no longer a dominant component in the meaning of the term.

Are you kidding? It's the *primary* component of the term. 

It's easy to dismiss it when you've never had it done to you, I guess. Nope, not kidding. I believe other posters in this thread would agree with me on this one. like I said, imo Some of them would, and some as obviously wouldn't. Besides, do you really go along with what everyone else is saying and doing?     </snippet></document><document><title>I don't have a date for Valentine's Day, but I'll be damned if I don't wear a pretty dress anyway.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bvvm/i_dont_have_a_date_for_valentines_day_but_ill_be/</url><snippet>I have had a navy blue floaty dress, knee-length with fluttery sleeves in my closet all year, and I haven't worn it once.

I intend on putting on that dress, heels, and makeup on Thursday night, and enjoying a microwave meal and Netflix for one.

Because I refuse to let being single be a reason not to celebrate, even if I'm only celebrating myself.  I dont have a date either.  

Ive had the biggest craving for chocolate covered strawberries recently so Im gonna get a big box of those for my dinner.  Im so excited. Haha my mom sent me a big bag of Dove dark chocolate, I'm saving it for Thursday's dessert :)  Yeah! This is what I did last year. Except I wrapped a steak in bacon and ate it with my best friend while we watched Mystery Science Theater 3000. There also might have been a little pot involved. It was actually one of my best Valentines Days ever. This sounds awesome.  I wish we were friends.   Yeah! This is what I did last year.

It was actually one of my best Valentines Days ever. Happy ValENTine's!  I may have to try and make something for r/trees using that.. Mmm, dat sweet, sweet karma! Hell yeah, lady ents unite! I love r/trees. They are the most female-friendly subreddit I have found outside TwoXChromosomes and other blatantly female subs. Everybody is so nice.  I agree they're *nice* but I've seen misogyny in all it's forms there in profusion.  Don't get me wrong, it's the same everywhere else--but the treeple are mostly sweet boys who would look out for their ladyfrients! Yes you're right about that- just in general I find the people there to be more good-natured/more wanting to be friendly and laid-back instead of insulting or inappropriate if they find out my gender. Good old treeple :) Yeah! This is what I did last year. Except I wrapped a steak in bacon and ate it with my best friend while we watched Mystery Science Theater 3000. There also might have been a little pot involved. It was actually one of my best Valentines Days ever. We like all of the same things. Be my Galentine! :) :) I'm a guy. Whoops, well, you can still be my galentine if you want. Sorry for assuming!   Finally, a V-day post I can relate to! I don't understand all the hate associated with it. I always tell people that everyone can celebrate Valentines Day regardless of relationship status. There's friends, family, pets, plants and you can just celebrate with yourself.  I look at Valentine's Day the same way. It's a day celebrating love and it doesn't necessarily mean love between a couple but it can be love between family and friends. 

Growing up my mom would buy me candy and a movie as gifts. There really isn't a need to be bitter about the holiday be it about not having a significant other or how it's just a consumer holiday (what holiday isn't?).

Love! Love! Love! &amp;lt;3 Finally, a V-day post I can relate to! I don't understand all the hate associated with it.

Celebrate what by yourself exactly? Valentine's day is just an excuse for people in relationships to have sex and buy things, and its an excuse for single people to get fucked up on their chemicals of choice. if you're in a relationship and you need an excuse to have sex you're in the wrong relationship Lol which just adds to the increasingly pointless negativity that valentines day perpetuates. It just puts even more pressure on people to jump into relationships because its a huge holiday that everyone celebrates so clearly if I can't celebrate it with someone there's something wrong with me. So I'll jump into a relationship which might not be a good one without thinking so I can fit in. Lol if you are going to date someone just so you can spend valentine's day together I think you're a little too sensitive to the media Celebrate what by yourself exactly? Valentine's day is just an excuse for people in relationships to have sex and buy things, and its an excuse for single people to get fucked up on their chemicals of choice. But some people enjoy it.  Christmas is just an excuse to give each other presents and perpetuate materialism.  Mother's Day is the same, but it reinforces stereotypes.  Halloween is just an excuse for people to dress weird and drink alcohol.  Fourth of July is just an excuse for people to blow stuff up, drink beer and eat to excess.

If you don't like it, you can make the mature, adult choice to ignore it.  It's a fairly easy holiday to ignore.  But don't you tell me what I can or can't celebrate or that my reasons for doing so are invalid just because you are clearly bitter. Celebrate what by yourself exactly? Valentine's day is just an excuse for people in relationships to have sex and buy things, and its an excuse for single people to get fucked up on their chemicals of choice.  Why not hang out with friends so you can get dressed up together? I know some of my single girlfriends are planning to go out on a "date" together so they can enjoy the festivities. I really wanted to have a dinner party or just regular party so my friends and I could get dressed up and enjoy ourselves but the Thursday part got in my way.  My femme-identified friends and I are doing the same... we're calling it Galentines Day Parks and rec reference!!!!!! You're awesome. Why not hang out with friends so you can get dressed up together?

It's really one of the biggest reasons I ever dress up in the first place, not really to impress anyone else.

I'm going to drink some wine and eat a bunch of chocolate.  Then I'll probably masturbate.  I'll be damned if I'm not getting some on St. Valentine's Day.           I've been debating the opposite actually! I'm not a girly-girl in the sightest and I feel most awkward in a dress. So yea, V-Day is coming up and I've been wondering if (when or if) the significant other and I go out to dinner that night if I wanted to be brave and pull out my pink strapless dress (that I've worn only once for a wedding, mind you) for the occasion, or would that be WAY too much? I dunno... I also feel weird wearing heels too, so I don't think I can do both and not feel like everyone is judging me for the negative. :/ *Do* it! As long as you act confident (even if you're peeing yourself with nerves) people will be like "Dang, she owns it!"  If they're not already sold out, pick up some flowers for yourself, too, if you like them. I did this several times when I was single. They're cheery and why can't we treat ourselves nice? If they're not already sold out, pick up some flowers for yourself, too, if you like them. I did this several times when I was single. They're cheery and why can't we treat ourselves nice?  I'm getting my best friend(also single), going out to a romantic dinner, buying each other flowers and dressing up. We're each other's substitute boyfriends.       My curiosity is likely going to leave me the target of malice...

but I need to ask why you'd do this? Why would you buy into valentines day that aid the social disdain of being single on the day? 

Why not take your dress (which I'm sure is beautiful) and just wear it on a regular day? Go out and own it. Don't sit at home and hide it. If you're single on Valentines day then it should just be a normal day. There's no reason to elevate it into something special; it's not.                  </snippet></document><document><title>Quick Question: If I take (practically) constant active birth control pills, how long should I wait to have unprotected sex after missing a pill?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18fean/quick_question_if_i_take_practically_constant/</url><snippet>I take Sprintec as 3 months of active pills and then 3 days of placebos.

I couldnt find a subreddit that seemed like it could help)

I recently lost some weight, I went from a size 9/10 to a size 4.  I lost it pretty unintentionally via my eating habits.  I am not, nor have I ever been anorexic or had an eating disorder.  But I've always been a snacker, I almost never eat full meals and I think my body just got used to eating so little at a time that now just a few bites of food will satisfy my until an hour or 2 later when a eat a few more bites.  

I was happy being a size 9/10 before and never really thought seriously about losing weight.  But now that I'm smaller, Im happy being a size 4.  I also really liked being a size 6 for a few months. 

My problem is I don't know how to change my eating habits to stay the size I am now.  I do not want to get any smaller!  How do I stay this size?  Is there a certain number of calories I should be eating?  Are there any foods I should make sure to eat every day?  I don't know what to do.     Do you exercise at all? That's going to be important to maintaining your weight and shape long-term, so you might want to head over to /r/Fitness; I will say that weight-lifting is a great way to keep your metabolism running efficiently.

And I'm kind of confused -- if your eating habits got you to your current size, what needs to change about them? Could you be more specific about what kinds of food you eat and how high your caloric intake is? Caloric intake vs calories burned is important, but most people are horrible at estimating the numbers of calories they eat, so I tend to go the eyeballing/satiety route because it's easier. There are some free websites ([Sparkpeople](http://sparkpeople.com/) comes to mind) that will help you find the caloric value of the foods you're eating. She wants to maintain her weight and not lose anymore weight; she's actually asking how to eat more calories on a consistent basis (or however many it would take to maintain her size). I understood that. So knowing her current caloric intake, which happened to get her to her current size, is important for weight maintenance. And since I assumed she wants to maintain that weight long-term, exercise is going to be necessary to keep her metabolism efficiently processing those calories, especially since reduced muscle-mass contributes to weight-gain even when caloric intake has not changed.

Edit: as for eating more calories on consistent basis, fat is where it's at. Avoid sugar, but unprocessed fatty foods will not make you fatter unless you are taking more in way more calories than you burn. Ahh, my bad, your answer sounded like you were assuming that she was worried about gaining weight, not losing it. Do you exercise at all?

I mean, she's a recovering bulimic, but still, she's making me feel fat."

I just thought that was so sad.  Curious about what everyone else's take on this is.      5'2" and 105 lbs is a normal body weight God I wish. I'm 5 ft 2 and could only hit 105 if I never ate again. Just because it's not normal for you doesn't mean it's not normal for anybody. never said it wasn't normal. o.O 

i know many girls who are that small built. me..i am 'stalky'. even when I weighed 110 i was still a little pudge ball (i'm a cute pudge ball, though..so no complaints). Oh, okay! Just misinterpreted what you wrote. "God I wish that were true," as opposed to "God I wish I could personally say that were true for me." God I wish. I'm 5 ft 2 and could only hit 105 if I never ate again. Well no, that's actually not true. All you'd need to do unless you have a thyroid disorder or something is eat less calories to lose weight, not starve yourself.  Well no, that's actually not true. All you'd need to do unless you have a thyroid disorder or something is eat less calories to lose weight, not starve yourself.  Losing weight 'healthily' isn't as simple as calories in &amp;lt; calories out, hell losing weight at all isn't as simple as calories in &amp;lt; calories out. (the argument usually goes like this by the way: blah blah blah thermodynamics, blah blah closed system countered with differing basal metabolic rate blah blah complex interplay of hormones blah grelin, leptin, oestrogen, GnRH, testosterone etc blah) Well it kind of is, if you need to lose weight the easiest thing to do other than cutting out junk food is just to generally eat less than you have previously been eating to gain or maintain your weight depending on your level of activity (both portions and calories, like foods lower in calories which tend to be on the healthier side). I mean I've done it, the concept behind it is actually pretty simple. but she said she would have to never eat again. Which probably isn't true. I'm not sure why I was down voted for stating a true fact You got downvoted because you're saying the same thing every fat person has heard over and over again "Have you just tried eating less?"

Yes, not eating will lead to weight loss, but generally not eating leads to starvation and death, so you have to eat something to continue living, which is significantly harder. 

For weight loss there's a couple of factors that come into play. Let's start with basal metabolic rate this varies between people (wiki explanation [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate#Causes_of_individual_differences_in_BMR)), so if two random individuals were sitting down, one would be burning more calories than the other, making it easier for that person to lose weight.

So weight loss is easier/harder depending on your BMR. We'll move on to complex interplay of hormones. From the top of my head hormones that are involved in weight gain/weight loss are: oestrogen, testostorone (it's why women have big hips and thighs when compared to men, and are often 'softer' looking, oestrogen tells the body where to deposit fat), leptin and ghrelin (satiety hormones telling the body when it's full), GnRH (and all those hormones that interact with GnRH to control the reproductive axis all tend to be involved in stimulating or inhibiting feeding behaviour) and thyroid hormones (all play a role in metabolism). So depending on the hormonal picture of your body you may find it easier or harder to lose weight.

And then we have the psychological, there's food addiction, because eating food stimulates dopamine release flooding your brain with happy chemicals, and unlike say meth, you can't just quit food cold turkey, no, you need to continue to eat which is hard. There's the fact that a lot of people use food as a comfort, which can be pretty hard to give up. There's the fact that diets have been proven over and over again to not work, and that rather than crash dieting people should be instead making healthier food choices. There's the fact that replacing chocolate with carrots does nothing to relieve the craving. There's the fact that skipping a meal for one person may be easy, it might even be case of forgetting to eat, while for others skipping a meal ends with the whole day focused on wanting to eat, on being hungry and ignoring your stomach and trying to concentrate when all you can think about is all the food you're not allowed to have. There's the fact that being obese/overweight isn't actually that bad for you (see [here](http://www.obesitymyths.com/myth4.1.htm) for a short summary) and that exercise and the location of fat is actually a better indicator of long term health (beer belly bad, big booty good). 

If it was as simple as just eat less, there wouldn't be a diet industry worth billions of dollars, there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic. 

The other reason you got downvoted was that you offered unsolicited diet advise, which tends to be frowned upon. Apologies if this came off as harsh, but it's an old argument which every fat person has had, and it gets boring and tired very quickly. She said to reach a weight lower than her own she would have to eat nothing at all, which is to starve. I just said that its not true and simply reducing calorie intake instead of not eating at all works just as well and also has the added bonus of not killing you

That's all. No diet advice just general information. All I said was that you don't have to stop eating completely to lose weight. Which is true. 

So yes, the general rule of "eat less calories, lose weight" really is that simple. In reality there are other factors like cravings and overeating that make sticking to this principle difficult. I know this. All I did was state a true fact that you dont have to stop eating to lose weight just eat fewer calories than you do now. Which is true.  Txgirl09 didn't ask for advice, or for 'facts'. You aren't her doctor, you aren't her dietician, you aren't her family or even her close friends, so why do you think you know more about her body than she does?

Did you read anything I posted. Losing weight is not simple for everybody. And losing weight healthily is definitely not that simple. Are you a dietician? Are you an endocrinologist? Like I said earlier, if all you had to do to lose weight is to eat less there wouldn't be a billion dollar diet industry, there wouldn't be a need for dieticians, or even endocrinologists, if all one had to do was monitor calories.

We are a 31/m and a 29/f, good jobs, good families, want to get married and not really preventing pregnancy. However, we were going to start being more careful assuming my period came this month. We had unprotected sex this month the entire week that I was in my fertile period, including the day of ovulation. I got off birth control in November and since then my periods have been like clockwork, every 26 days. Yesterday was the 26th day of my cycle and no period. My cervix is sitting high up in my vagina and feels hard like the tip of my nose. I assumed a high cervix that close to the typical date of menstruation may indicate a pregnancy. I had to go to the doctor yesterday and get a chest x-ray and before they x-rayed me they took a pregnancy test which came back negative. I took one at home too the day prior. Here it is, almost the end of day 27 and still no period! I'm starting to get a wee bit concerned. I'm feeling some strange cramping in my pelvic region, sometimes like pressure. Not my usual menstrual cramps. Are the pregnancy tests lying? 


**UPDATE: You guys! you guys! My period finally came! Thank you for all your help!**  As far as I knew pregnancy tests generally aren't accurate until after when you would have had your period, you were probably getting false positives. You need to go take another text.  False negatives you mean? As far as I knew pregnancy tests generally aren't accurate until after when you would have had your period, you were probably getting false positives. You need to go take another text.  Got another negative this AM. Its now day 29 of this cycle.   So you would have gotten your period as of 3 days ago? I'd go see your doctor then. You might just have a delayed one.   if I were you I would pop down to the pharmacy and grab a couple home tests. If you had sex EVERY DAY while fertile including ovulation, I would not be surprised if you were pregnant... but, I am not a doctor.

Get some more tests girl! I've taken several at home too! If I don't wake up bleeding tomorrow morning, I'm peeing on another stick.   i've not gotten my period on time because i was stressed about being pregnant before.  
maybe it's the same for you? (except I didn't want to be pregnant and maybe you do?) 

i've also heard that if your period is late and then you have a particularly heavy one that it could be a super early miscarriage. (like i said, i just *heard* this somewhere..I forget where)  maybe you are but it's just not quite right this time? 

Good luck, I hope whatever you want to happen does :)   </snippet></document><document><title>Libido Help and More</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18etls/libido_help_and_more/</url><snippet>Note sure if this is the right place to post this, but, hello all! Double question here: What is the best vitamin/supplement I can take to boost my libido? I take anti-depressants and I want to be more in the mood for my guy. note: I have a GNC across from my house and cannot afford a doctor.

Also, I have a problem with feminine odor. I use Rephresh and it helps, but I still smell a little when I am aroused, making my SO not want to go down on me. Help? Thanks  You shouldn't use stuff Rephresh. It's actually more likely to cause your vagina to smell, since you're disrupting the natural balance of good bacteria. There's actually a good article on this:

http://womenshealthnews.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/rephresh-reno/

As far as libido, have you talked to your doctor about possibly trying a medication that is less likely to effect it? You said you can't afford it, but if you can't afford to go to the doctor, how are you on medication? I read the article and rephresh isn't "flowery" or anything and it has helped...just not enough. I talked to my doctor before I graduated and they suggested I stay on the medication because this is the only side-effect I was having. You can get a "bulk" amount of medication where I went to school so it's lasting for a bit.  It's not really the scent so much as you're putting something up there that changes the natural balance. Smell is natural. It'll never be scentless. If you're concerned, you should try to get to a Planned Parenthood for a check up.</snippet></document><document><title>why do men seem to age so much better than women?  Is it biology or some sort of illusion? </title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18dq53/why_do_men_seem_to_age_so_much_better_than_women/</url><snippet>  They don't age any differently.  

Look, I work in an office stuffed with middle-aged and older men.  Some of them look amazing.  Some of them look decrepit.  There's the full range of human expression.

What men do NOT do in their youth is spend hours on artifice and carefully controlling their appearance.  You look at a woman how she looked naturally at 20 and how she looks naturally at 45 and (on average) it's going to be about the same as the comparison for a guy.  But makeup and excessive diet/exercise control and so forth only do so much as you start to confront metabolic changes, potential reproduction, and other biological changes.  So the difference can SEEM more dramatic than it really is. They don't age any differently.

But makeup and excessive diet/exercise control and so forth only do so much as you start to confront metabolic changes, potential reproduction, and other biological changes.  So the difference can SEEM more dramatic than it really is. But studies have shown that men are more attracted to youthfulness in women than women are in men. The difference is in each sex's interpretation of the other. The difference is in the media's portrayal of what is important in each gender. A woman's value is in her youth and beauty. Once her youth is gone, she's no longer seen as beautiful. A man is seen to just get more handsome with age, as he is valued for maturity and whatnot. Don't underestimate the effect that society and the media has on our views of each other. It's hard to test this idea because non-westernized countries that don't have the same form of mass media also tend not to allow women to choose their partners.

I don't think there's a conception that men get more handsome as they age, unless handsome is a euphemism for 'refined and tidy looking but no longer sexy'. I think they're just perceived to lose their attractiveness more slowly than women.

I'm willing to believe that the media is a cause in the perception of youth as highly important to female attractiveness, but not until it is statistically supported, and I doubt that it is the sole or primary cause. As for any non-Western country, I am solely referring to the U.S. here. Pretty much all female beauty traits are ones that are associated with youth. In the US, the "hottest actresses" are all pretty young. Men, however, are still seen as very handsome even when their hair is graying or they have crow's feet. As a woman, I've definitely heard the old "men get better-looking as they age" thing. It's a commonly held belief. Think about George Clooney, Brad Pitt, etc. Men are seen as still being handsome well into their 50s, and women are not. This is because society defines female beauty as being equal to youth. You can also see the emphasis on youth as a desirable trait in women when you think of the personality traits that are seen as attractive in women: giggly, carefree, innocent, and so on. All child-like or youthful characteristics.

I'm not sure how you would expect to statistically support this. But it seems pretty clear that we are given the definition of beauty by our culture and society. As we grow up, we learn how our particular culture defines beauty. It's taught, not innate. And it just so happens that in the U.S. / western culture's definition of beauty, women are given a shorter time slot in which they're considered beautiful. What else would be the cause besides media/culture/society? In your opinion.   Because of the way society has decided to measure women's worth. Men have more qualities society has deemed worthwhile that they still possess as they age while women are valued less and for far more narrow ranges of things. 

Basically: it doesn't matter if you are the head of a country, a famous author, a spiritual leader, or a successful CEO, if you are a lady people are mostly going to talk about how good or ugly you look.  how can one change that view?  How can we move forward as a society? That is a really good question, and something I've often thought about as well. In my opinion, it starts at the individual/family/social group level. If parents encourage their daughters to care far more about academic success (or success in other skill-related areas-- music, sports, art, trades) rather than appearance, those girls may grow up to value themselves and other women for what they can do, rather than just what they look like. Then in turn, if people make a conscious effort to praise women for their skills and success rather than only their looks, that will contribute to the overall societal view of what "matters" about a woman. 

For example, if the media stopped printing crap about the physical appearance of women whose careers have nothing to do with looks (e.g. Hillary Clinton), that could make a big impact. And this goes for individuals as well. A large percentage of women my age with whom I'm FB friends are rather appearance-obsessed. When they make an appearance-related post, tons and tons of people turn out to "like" it and praise them. When a friend recently posted about getting a new job, only a few people even seemed to notice; same goes for another friend's admission to grad school, my sister-in-law's great score on the GRE, a friend passing the bar exam, etc. As a society and as individuals, we need to focus way, way more on what women can do, rather than what they look like. how can one change that view?  How can we move forward as a society? Because of the way society has decided to measure women's worth. Men have more qualities society has deemed worthwhile that they still possess as they age while women are valued less and for far more narrow ranges of things. 

Basically: it doesn't matter if you are the head of a country, a famous author, a spiritual leader, or a successful CEO, if you are a lady people are mostly going to talk about how good or ugly you look.  Well isn't this kind of irrelevant because she's talking about the physical appearance of both?

Like why does a man look better at 45 than a woman does? It's not because they're a ceo or because they're important or rich or cool. Physical appearance has nothing to do with how much money you have or what your job is (unless you get plastic surgery or something). She's asking why do men seem to physically age better than women?


&amp;gt;if you are a lady people are mostly going to talk about how good or ugly you look.

yeah but we're talking about the "how good or ugly you look" with both of the sexes here. I just don't understand where jobs and society has come into it\

Personally I don't think any gender ages better than the other and it depends on the individual but I'm just not sure why you brought up money  Well isn't this kind of irrelevant because she's talking about the physical appearance of both?

Personally I don't think any gender ages better than the other and it depends on the individual but I'm just not sure why you brought up money  The answer is: men are allowed to have other things going for them, a women is her appearance and that alone in many ways to many people. If a old man looks bad it's okay, it's not as big a deal, if a women is ugly that is it, all her worth is gone.   But that's irrelevant. If an old man looks bad then he's not included in this conversation. HIs wealth or social standing has nothing to do with how well his face and body aged.  If a woman or a man looks ugly and they're rich then they're still ugly.

Like I understand what you're saying there's just nothing about "the other things going for them" that has anything to do with how well you age physically. If you look at the faces of a bunch of people of different genders and see how well they age you're not going to be able to tell if one is a CEO or salesman or a real estate agent or whatever. You're just going to see faces and wrinkles and age

This is true of societies, but it was true on a biological level before that. Most attributes that make women more sexually attractive to men are indicators of fertility, while the same relationship between male attractiveness and fertility is not as strong.

The effect is that evolution favors younger women for fertility, and older men (up to a certain age) for their maturity and ability to provide resources.

This doesn't mean that the societal/cultural influence doesn't also exist, but it explains the issue without requiring it.

Next tell us about how black people have bumps on their head that make them suited for slavery!  If you ignore the science, you're going to have a bad time.

At no point did I imply that an evolutionary preference towards younger women makes it okay to judge a woman's value by her youthfulness. Women are treated differently than men at least partially for biological reasons, and if we want to work towards a fair society, we need to acknowledge and deal with these issues.

Nature is sexist. We don't have to be, but if we want to be better we have to understand this. Besides, the OP was asking if the cause is biological, so I looked up journal articles on the topic in biology. What's your source? Most of evolutionary psych is not science, though, because it's not based on testable predictions. Most of it is just untested/able hypotheses based on an (often fairly shallow) understanding of evolution. 

That's not to say that there aren't *some* valid findings in evo psych; it's just to say that the normal scientific process for weeding out the invalid findings is not really in place there. So there's a great deal of bullshit mixed in, compared to other sciences and even to other scientific branches of psychology. I can accept this, however I'd echo a point eriktheguy is making, and that is why is it then treated that society and culture is the null hypothesis for human variation when it comes to behavior? A major issue I have is that there *is* sexual dimorphism between the sexes. To observe that and then to be convinced that from the neck up we're indistinguishable, except for cultural programming, is not something I find convincing.

Basically: it doesn't matter if you are the head of a country, a famous author, a spiritual leader, or a successful CEO, if you are a lady people are mostly going to talk about how good or ugly you look.     I don't think men age any better than women. For every George Clooney, there is a Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Monica Belluci etc. And I think in the real world it is skewed even more in women's favor, because for better or worse, women have more pressure on them to look good and keep looking good, so after natural good looks start to fade, women usually have more knowledge and practice at good diet, excercise, fashion &amp;amp; make-up knowledge to preserve their good looks longer. I mean, just the other day I was looking at my mom's high school reunion photos (she was born in 1956) and the difference was astounding - out of the surviving men (yes, a few had already succumbed to heart-attacks, cancer, accidents) there was maybe a few well-dressed guys in decent shape, the rest were moderately to grossly overweight or at the very least had a beer-guts, balding or bald or sporting wildly unflattering hairstyles, badly groomed (abundant ear and nose-hair, badly groomed nails, cigarette-stained teeth) etc. The "worst" looking women were a little pudgy and dressed in matronly clothes. Of course, this might be partly due to cultural background (I live in Eastern Europe, we let men get away with A LOT more than women), but overall, I still think this holds true.


edited for grammar  Aging is largely dependent upon lifestyle. People in my family that eat crap, don't exercise, have kids, worship the sun, and/or smoke look significantly older than family members that have good habits.

Example: I am 28 (vegan, exercise daily, without kids, don't smoke, and I am very pale) people think I am between 19 and 21. My brother is a couple years older (eats only fast food, has kids, chain smokes, doesn't believe in exercise, and had a lot of sun damage) and people think he looks like he is in his mid to late 40's. Same genes but he looks old enough to be my father.             How society constitutes attraction is a subjective argument in itself, and on I won't dwell on here.

My personal guess is that the aesthetic appeal of the male body isn't dependent on tenuously suspended sacs of fat, (the ever popular "tits and ass") which are more vulnerable to the ravages of time regarding various connective tissues and elasticity.</snippet></document><document><title>How do you last longer in the gym?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18divu/how_do_you_last_longer_in_the_gym/</url><snippet>I've just started going and the first couple of times was fine but last time I just found it so hard to keep going!

I usually row for ten minutes, maybe use the cycle machines for another ten then make the cross trainer my main activity.

Not sure how to stop myself getting tired so early in though :/  You just started going! You can't expect to last forever in the gym right away.  With time, you'll build up that endurance that you're looking for.

There's no reason to switch in the middle of a workout (switching different days is fine). What's probably happening is since you keep switching after 10 min the muscles for that particular form of cardio aren't building and you aren't making progress. Terms of the asthma just keep doing small amounts. I have asthma add well and went from being able to run a mile to doing a 5k over a summer. Just small increases.

 _yes_.  i don't understand why but most women seem to completely ignore the weight room.  weights are important!

and yes, stick to one type of cardio per day. I only recently gained the confidence to use the weight room. Now I'm elbowing the guys out of my way.  For one stop doing 100% cardio.

  Make sure you're drinking enough water - not so that it's sloshing around in your stomach but so that you're hydrated. Being dehydrated is a sure-fire way to cut your workout short!             Carb loading, a strong coffee, a good night's sleep, and a good metal album all help me out. 

Don't stress too much. Your body is pretty incredible, and if you keep it up, she'll surprise you by how quickly she adapts to what you throw at her.  Coffee + cardio = needing to take a ridiculous shit in the middle of the workout. </snippet></document><document><title>Egyptian women: &#8220;It&#8217;s time for our voices to be heard&#8221;</title><url>http://egyptianstreets.com/2013/02/12/egyptian_women_sexual_harassment/</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Catcalled and followed home after work</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18d61u/catcalled_and_followed_home_after_work/</url><snippet>I work a swing shift so I get off work later than most people normally do. Tonight, while in my car at an intersection, I was smoking cigarette when I heard someone from the car next to me say, "Hey, what's up?" I ignored him. I couldn't see him anyway because while his car was next to mine, it was also a bit further back so I couldn't see his face (nor did I want to and give him an impression). I ignored him. Then I heard, "You better ash that." That's when I stubbed my cigarette out and rolled up my window.

The light turned green and when it did, the car immediately got into my lane and that's when I freaked out. I drove home a different way and called my boyfriend to stay on the phone with me. I didn't know where the nearest police station was and I lost him along the way anyway. I called my mom and was really upset and she said that next time this happens, I call 911 and tell them either where I'm at or drive back to my job (which was 5 mins away at that point) and have them meet me there. I was shaking the rest of the drive home.

I know it's not something huge but it still rattled me and made me feel unsafe. This is the route I take home most because I have a nervous bladder so I know that there are restrooms along the way. Now I feel like I can't go that way, and I'll just be even more anxious on the drive home. 

I guess what I'm just asking for is commiseration. My boyfriend understood but didn't REALLY understand, you know? This has never happened to him. I hate that I can't even drive home in peace smoking a cigarette without someone hassling me. 

This also probably means I should stop smoking, hah.  This happened to my mom once when I was little. I was in the car in the backseat and a man started following us. My mom was ok at first until she realized that the car behind us made the same turns over and over that we had made. He pulled up next to us at a light and stared at her. He kept getting behind us. My mom kept turning and turning and he kept following us and gesturing behind us and it was really freaking her out but she was trying to keep cool for me, I guess, but I was like 10 or 11 so I could tell she was FREAKING OUT.

She finally ended up running a red light and pulling into a side street. We pulled into a stranger's driveway and turned off the car and she told me to lay down in the seat so we ducked down and waited. The car circled the block 3 times and finally went away so we pulled out and drove away. Then when we were on the main road we realized that the car had pulled over to wait outside of that neighborhood so we were still being followed and she ended up driving to the police station. I guess once he realized we were pulling into the parking lot he didn't think it was worth getting arrested over so he turned around and drove away. It was literally the most frightening experience of my young life I still have no idea why that happened This happened to my mom once when I was little.

I guess once he realized we were pulling into the parking lot he didn't think it was worth getting arrested over so he turned around and drove away. It was literally the most frightening experience of my young life I still have no idea why that happened  I live in a large city, and this similar thing happened to me as I was walking on foot. I had just left the bar, alone, after meeting up with a friend. I know the area pretty damn well, and it's heavily populated, so I had no qualms about walking home alone. 

Not ten feet from the bar does some 30-something male approach me and asks my name and holds out a hand for what I assume was a pamphlet of some sort. Thinking he's just some street vendor wanting to sell me something, and not having the super best judgement due to alcohol, I say my first name and keep walking, saying, "My name is _____, but I'm not interested, not interested, not interested, sir." In hindsight, probably shouldn't have mentioned my first name, but again, my own stupidity due to the alcohol.

He keeps following me as I'm walking down the street, and now I know he's not just a vendor. He keeps holding out his hand, asking questions about me, "where you from? What you doing tonight? Would you like some company tonight?" I keep saying "no, no please leave me alone, I'm not interested." At this point I'm not looking at him, but I'm getting flustered and nearly walk into a tree branch because I'm trying to gain some space between us. This lingers for three blocks, and people are walking by or near us and hearing all this and nobody does anything.

At this point, it's too late for me to turn back and find my friend as she left in the opposite direction. The guy continues to pursue me when I need to cross the street. I say, "well, I have to cross here, good-BYE!" I figure, this dude isn't going to follow me any further, that'd be stupid.

But he does. He continues with his little schpeel, Now adding, "It's a free country, I can walk next to you all I want!" Major creep points. I walk through the nearby mall (again, large city) that is a short-cut to my house, and he's still following me up the stairs. Now I'm freaking, so I look around for security guards, but of course it's 11-12 at night so they're not exactly where I need them. My phone was mostly dead, but I figured that maybe he'll leave me alone if he thinks I'm calling the police. I take it out and start visibly dialing, and like clockwork he says, "why you gotta be like that, honey?" makes some disgruntled sound, and walks away.

I call my friend briefly, tell her to be on the look-out and tell her what happened. Then I continue to look behind me, making sure he wasn't following me before I walked into my building (I didn't want him to know where I lived.)

Overall 0/10, would not do again. Drunk me is pretty friendly and likes to talk, so I have a made up story for situations like this. I've recited it enough times that it's kind of believable. I tell the guy that my babysitter is leaving at [15-20 minutes from current time] and that I have to get back to my three kids (I even have names and ages, if he asks). Then I tell him thanks for reminding me that I have to get the child support check from baby daddy #2.

If this doesn't work (though it always has), I just don't tell him that real me is 10 months away from her black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  I worked at a place where I was the last one there, so I had all the joys of closing up before heading home. Home was a 15 minute trip by bicycle and was generally pretty uneventful if not eerily quiet at times.

Finished up one night and got all my stuff together, locked up behind me and started the ride home. Not long after I had started the ride I heard the sound of a car behind me. Even though I was on the footpath, I was still aware of it as I had to cross a couple roads to get home, and I didn't want to shoot across late at night, even with reflectors and blinking LEDs visible.

But the car didn't pass, and I was starting to get concerned so I glanced out of the corner of my eye to see this person keeping rough speed with me, to the point of speeding up when I did. Naturally I started freaking the fuck out, trying to figure out how far away the nearest police station was, if I should just turn into some random person's house and try to explain myself without sounding crazy (yeah, I'm on a bike and this car is following me).

I ended up losing them down a narrow path and made my way home with no further incidents. I found out later from a nearby business that the very same car had parked a bit away from my work earlier that night and 3 guys had gotten out and looked like they were going to rob the place till someone else suddenly showed up.

For a good long while after that I varied my route both to and from work. Still don't know if it actually was what it looked like, but to be perfectly honest I don't think finding out after that it was a misunderstanding would've helped me feel any less freaked.    </snippet></document><document><title>cross post from r/mommit: Media Literacy for Girls</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18efu0/cross_post_from_rmommit_media_literacy_for_girls/</url><snippet>Hi ladies!
I work with 8-12 year-old girls on Wednesday nights. We'll be focusing on media for the next 2 weeks and I want to cover:

-Media safety (i.e. don't put your address on facebook.)
-Bullying
-Body image / false standards
-Media's focus on material things
-How media can help (learning, news, etc.)

Does anyone know of any good websites I can get projects or videos? What do you wish you would have known at that age?

Thanks!  YES! Miss Representation.org! I love this video and I think it is so interesting! I think they send it out for showings to schools I'm not quite sure if it's free or not but you can also get it on amazon for 15-20$. Worth it.  I ran a similar group for intellectually challenged young adults and discussed sharing info on the internet. They understood the not sharing the address thing but thought it was safe to share their phone number....one young lady had a man show up at her house after doing reverse lookup. Make sure you impress on them how easily someone can find them with seemingly innocent comments. The name of their school, community, hangouts etc.</snippet></document><document><title>I just found out I'm pregnant 30 minutes ago, I need friends</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cra0/i_just_found_out_im_pregnant_30_minutes_ago_i/</url><snippet>It's my ex boyfriends, but I know he'll deny it.

I don't know what to do, I'm only twenty. My ex is not going to want anything to do with me or the baby. I can't afford an abortion, and I'm not even sure I want one. My ex is taking me to court because he's put his hands on me before so my only close friend put his phone number on YouTube (petty, but tehe) and now I have to go to court for this crap, and now I find out I'm pregnant. I wanna pull my.hair out, I don't know what to do  Definitely look into your local Planned Parenthood or other women's health clinic - whatever you decide, be sure to get all the healthcare you need. And at places like PP, they will also have resources to talk to doctors and people who can help you make the best decision, and maybe even some legal advice for how to deal with your ex and how to protect yourself from nasty paternity issues later. 

But also, -hugs- from here, too. Be strong, and know that you are worth it.  This is a really tough situation to be in. And you are surely going through 1000 different emotions. I have been there myself, and it is terrifying. I wish I could give you a hug or offer you more than words of empathy and advise. No solution is going to be easy or painless. I wish you much love. 

How are you feeling? What do you feel want to do? When you really are honest with yourself what are your thoughts? 

I stand by a woman's decision in these situations. However, as a single mother, I feel I should share the cold, hard reality. I wish someone had been straight with me. I love my child. He is amazing and wonderful, and I am grateful for him. But it has been a long, hard road. I had to give up so much. I gave up my youth and chosen career path. I have given up relationships and friends. I am tied to his father forever. I struggle financially. I am happy with my life because it is what it is. But I occasionally dream of how it might have been different if I had done things a little more thoughtfully and mindfully.

There are 2 things that really stuck out to me. One is finances. If you can't afford an abortion, think about the cost of a kid. It is about 100,000x the cost. And then, there is the incredible responsibility and emotional investment it requires. 

The other is this guy. The idea of a woman being to tied to an unstable, abusive d-bag for life and having a kid with him is hard to wrap my mind around. Just because you think he does not want anything to do with the baby now means that won't change or he will be out of your life. He has the right to be a father, and he could choose to exercise it. If you apply for social services, you will have to name him and they will go after him for support. He will be in your life forever somehow, and you will be tied to him. 

Whatever you do, things usually have a way of working out. It may not be the way you imagined. And any way you do, it's going to be hard, and it will suck. But it gets better, and you will be alright. You have accomplished things before, and you will do so again. 

Take care of yourself. This is a really tough situation to be in. And you are surely going through 1000 different emotions. I have been there myself, and it is terrifying.

What you say is a very real possibility, however, there are cases when a father can be absent from his child and the child's mothers life. 

I know someone whose father ended up losing his parental rights after a couple acts of violence and neglect were reported to the police and the court, and the state ended up garnishing his wages for child support when he repeatedly failed to pay. 

It took a few years, but he has been out of his child's and ex-wife's life for a couple of decades, now, and they're doing alright.  If you can't afford an abortion, how are you supposed to afford a child? They are slightly more expensive.

Big big hugs, this is hard stuff. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted]   If you don't want an abortion, disregard this advice. If you think you want an abortion, but don't think you can afford it, there are programs that exist to help women pay for abortion services.
 [National Network of Abortion Funds](http://fundabortionnow.org/get-help) is a good place to start. They can also tell you about regional programs in your area that provide financial assistance. Also, abortions become more expensive the farther along you are in the pregnancy, so although I'd hate for you to feel pressured into making a decision too soon, please remember that time is of the essence here. I'm just gonna reply here, instead of a new thread if op doesn't like the idea of an abortion.  But one of my big thoughts when in similar situation was, what would you hate more. To regret having an abortion. Or to regret having a child in this situation.  [deleted]  I am 20 too, I understand how this is terrifying. 

You don't have to be a mom though, you don't even have to be pregnant, what happens next is completely in your control. 

If you can't afford an abortion then you have options. If you can't afford an abortion can you imagine having to pay for a baby? But you don't have to get an abortion if you don't want one. 

Just because you carry the baby doesn't mean you have to be a mom, adoption is an option.

If none of those are working out then you have to think about how you would make a baby work. Do you have a job? Do you have family support? The support of friends. I think the key here is that you can't do it on your own.

You have the potential to be a good mom, even if it doesn't happen now it could still happen in the future. I think everyone feels like they are a bad person when they are 20. We are at a selfish and confusing point in our lives and I hope you have the support to find out what is going to work for you. Much love.  (((hugs)))

Take care of yourself.  Start all the good habits you know of, drop all the bad habits you cultivated.  Run to the nearest drug store and get some cheap pre-natal vitamins TONIGHT.  They may make your stomach sick, but they will hold you over until you can get to a doctor to be checked out.

Call your doctor and ask for an OB/GYN referral.  You will need to go in for an initial checkup.  The OB/GYN can give you samples of uber-expensive pre-natal vitamins so you can try them out.  But your baby needs that folic acid now, not wednesday, not next week, not next month.  NOW.

Your choice is yours.  Don't let him or anyone else pressure you into a choice that is not right for you.  If you are scared, you can go to counseling - I would recommend a Planned Parenthood center or a licensed psychologist if your insurance covers it.  Any of those 'birth choice" or "birth decision support" places will be pushing their own agenda.

Take care of yourself.   [deleted] It's going to be ok. You need to stop drinking and smoking now if you might keep the baby or give it up for adoption, but there's a very good chance that you haven't hurt the fetus yet.

And if you decide that you do want an abortion after talking to a counselor and considering your choices, there are some organizations that help fund them for people who can't afford them depending on where you are, and you may be able to set up a payment plan. It's your decision, and it shouldn't be made by your immediate financial situation. Consoling, but in all honesty don't blindly claim

&amp;gt;a very good chance that you haven't hurt the fetus yet.

The fetus is most sensitive during the first trimester.  If she just found out today (well, yesterday) then she very well could be very very early in her pregnancy. It's very possible that there hasn't been damage to the fetus yet. Now if she finds out that she's actually over a month pregnant, she could very well be in trouble. But if the only alcohol she's had since conception was getting drunk once, she's pretty likely ok. This happens to many many women because at the very beginning you don't know you're pregnant, and it very frequently turns out ok.

Edited to add: and if she's only supposed to have started her period a few days ago, her drinking last week may even have happened before implantation was complete. By the time you have missed a period, you are considered 4 weeks pregnant. So she's likely at least 4 weeks along. By the time you have missed a period, you are considered 4 weeks pregnant. So she's likely at least 4 weeks along. Consoling, but in all honesty don't blindly claim

&amp;gt;a very good chance that you haven't hurt the fetus yet.

The fetus is most sensitive during the first trimester.  There's still a very good chance. Many (half? I read that somewhere) pregnancies are carried to term by women who hadn't planned them, and I guarantee that many of those hadn't been behaving pregnancy-optimally.

The chances of major problems are increased but not nearly 100%. I wasn't implying that it was, or even that it was likely. I just meant that it shouldn't be just written off.  [deleted] Just a comforting anecdote: I got pretty blasted during the first 3 weeks of BOTH of my pregnancies because I had no clue I was pregnant. Both pregnancies were healthy, normal, and babies came out normal and unaffected. Don't panic about that. Just take care of your body for now and try to figure out what you want to do.  That's a relief. I'm hoping to fall pregnant, but I'll be damned if I'll stop drinking (the little that I do) until I find out. That's a relief. I'm hoping to fall pregnant, but I'll be damned if I'll stop drinking (the little that I do) until I find out. You should still stop drinking. Just because she thinks her babies came out normal and unaffected doesn't mean that they didn't. It's possible that if she hadn't drunk any alcohol they would have been faster, smarter, healthier, etc. If all you're worried about is fetal alcohol syndrome, then by all means get blasted. If you want the happiest, healthiest baby you can possibly have, then you should stop drinking. [deleted] You should be fine.  Just do the right thing for yourself and your baby.  OK??

It sounds like ex-bf is not the right guy for yourself or your baby.  

I think a lie down in bed with soothing music and the lights down low are called for here.  Do you have any friends locally that you can call?  Some chocolate covered strawberries might be just the thing to help you calm down.  And someone to give you a hug when think 'OMG!  I"m going to have to deal with ex-bf for the next 18 years!!! GAAAHHHHH"

(((hugs)))

What can I do to change that?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cnrl/my_husband_thinks_im_the_most_evil_person_what/</url><snippet>My husband has told me before that I'm an evil person. He says this when we're arguing. He's called me a cunt and a bitch numerous times while we are fighting. When we are not arguing, he is a sweet and caring man. If we have any kind of disagreement, small or large, anything and everything I say afterward is somehow automatically a personal attack against him. I can provide a couple of recent examples:

Yesterday:

We fought in the morning about something that was resolved after an hour or two of talking. On a totally different subject, I asked him how much of something he needed for his project so we can go get some at the store. He said eight. I thought it would be less, but it wasn't a big deal, they're less than a buck each. But I was a little surprised that the number was higher than I thought so I said, "Eight? Why eight?" I SWEAR TO YOU, I was not angry in any way, I said it with only a confused/surprised tone... and yet he still was so upset he started yelling at me why he needed exactly eight. I tried explaining to him that I wasn't upset, but he swears I had an angry/upset tone... I don't know what to do... I KNOW I didn't... I wasn't even the slightest bit upset. And yet there we were.

Today:

His dad's asking us to fly over (lives a few states away). I am absolutely phobic of flying, the thought makes my heart race and I want to cry. But he really wants to see his dad so I told him I'd check the calendar at work tomorrow to see when I can go without holding any projects back. I thought we were done talking about it because he seemed okay. I started thinking about how my first sibling ever is expected to be born next month. I live 2 hours away from them so I was wondering what I'm supposed to do. I've never had a sibling before, nobody in my family has had a baby in 18 years. I don't know if I'm supposed to drive down there as soon as I hear my stepmom's in labor, or if I'm supposed to wait until the weekend instead of taking off work... so many things going through my mind about what to do. I don't ever want my little sister to think I didn't care about her. So I turn and ask my husband for advice. I ask him, "Am I supposed to be there when my sister is born?" He blows up and says, "WTF I'm not trying to keep you from your family!!!" This shocks me, because I wasn't even THINKING that at all...

I don't know what to do. I beg him to please... if my tone might be questionable... to please don't assume the worst... to please not think I'm being mean... yet the only way he reacts is as if I'm out to get him.

English is my second language, so I'm afraid some things are lost in translation and the tone that my people use is a little harsh apparently compared to how Americans speak. I barely notice it, how can I? I grew up with people speaking to me in this tone. The only time I really spent with a white American is with my husband, everyone else I've spent time with spoke as harshly as I apparently do.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying as hard as I can, ALWAYS, to sound nicer, to say things in a nicer way... which is incredibly difficult for me. I learned English by mimicking and I have such a difficult time trying to say something nicer... because very few people have ever set that example for me... When I am being as nice as I can, he still thinks I'm being mean and manipulative... I don't know... I don't know why, I don't know what to do...

I haven't told any of my friends or family how upset I am, I would never want them to think he ever makes me anything but happy... but I don't know what to do anymore. We can not afford any counseling or therapy. Is this an irreconcilable difference? What can I do to stop sounding so evil?  Honestly, it sounds like HE is manipulative.  I think there is something fundamentally wrong with your relationship.  

How often do the two of you fight?   I would say not very often. I notice that we only really fight when there is something that stresses him out. Before, it was the people we lived with. Then when we moved, it was that neither of us could find work and we were drowning in debt. When we both found work, we'd be fine unless his health started to go down, that was pretty stressful for both of us. Nobody wants to be in pain, nobody wants to see their husband in pain. On top of that, we can't afford health insurance and so the bills stack sky high, which can be stressful to anyone in our situation. His dad has been acting funny lately... he thinks his dad is keeping something from him about his health. He's worried his dad is dying, basically. It sounds like you are rationalizing his behavior.  It sounds like he is on his best behavior when things are good, but as soon as things get tough, his true self comes out.  It is NOT acceptable to be verbally abusive to one's partner.  Calling you a cunt &amp;amp; evil is just plain wrong.  Why the hell would someone talk to the person they love so terribly?  

The problem isn't your tone.  It's him.  He's abusive to you.  Do you really want to stay with someone who treats you so poorly? I wouldn't consider that his true self. I would hope nobody considered me at my worst to be MY true self. I would say not very often. I notice that we only really fight when there is something that stresses him out.

His dad has been acting funny lately... he thinks his dad is keeping something from him about his health. He's worried his dad is dying, basically. If it seems that there's always something that drives him to yell at you and put you down, the problem isn't the bad situations you've found yourself in. It's him. Does it matter if I'm actually worse than he is? I mean, I figure just like with every job, every person is going to have something that is disagreeable to me one way or another. I don't have a problem with his job or how he works, I don't have a problem with the way he treats people, he's very intelligent, he's got a good heart, and a right head on his shoulders. Maybe this is his imperfection, which happens to be mine as well. (As in I get maaaaad sometimes, the some of my elders did when I was young and did something bad.) I feel like some people are overreacting because they weren't brought up that way. He's not ever laid a hand on me. My parents used to spank, do various kinds of Catholic punishment, but I woudn't tolerate that. Here's the thing, if someone repeatedly makes you feel bad about who you are (not just about an action, or due to a single misunderstanding that they apologize for), they are abusing you, whether they do it with their fists or their words.

Abuse can leave marks on your heart and mind as well as your face and body. 

If you honestly don't feel like this is abuse, just miscommunication, or, if you too are putting him down and trying to hurt him with words constantly, you should look into cheaper counseling if you can find it in your area. Again, depending on where you are, there are probably women's help hotlines that can put you into contact with counseling services.
 I understand what you're saying, I really do, but I really wouldn't consider it abuse. I wouldn't if a friend complained about her husband doing the same thing. Verbal "abuse" is different in different cultures and families. As for scars, I have a few tiny scars on my arm from my cat from years ago, it hurt when it happened, not anymore. I spanked my cat when it happened even though he didn't mean to scratch me. It didn't mean anything then and it doesn't now. My cat is still affectionate, he learned not to climb on me, and I did learn to trim his nails. If my cat bit me in defense or anger, I'd take care of the situation appropriately. If you don't think it's abuse or even think it's that bad, then why ask for help in stopping it?

Also, you don't seem to have addressed the suggestions that you seek counseling from cheap/free resources. Is that not an option for you? I'm asking how I can sound less harsh. I don't know if you've read some of the other comments, I learned from a young age to speak the way I do in the tone that I do, if there is something I'm missing in how to not sound so harsh, I would not know it. I have zero experience being nice. My "nice" expression, I've learned, actually comes off as scared or shy.

As for the counseling, I mentioned in the post that we don't have the resources. I didn't mention that we live someplace rural and there are few to no places to go here for help (and I wouldn't trust these people anyway. 99.99% of the people in this valley are evangelical Christians, and I do not believe in or agree with that.) Reddit is my free resource, and it's been nice talking to you guys, actually. It's very difficult to give speech instructions over the internet via text, particularly when most users instructing you probably aren't familiar with cultural or verbal nuances found in your native language.

I'd tell you to just speak genuinely, but I recognize that genuine kindness in English might not sound the same as genuine kindness or sympathy in Hindi or Urdu or Mandarin or Spanish. Maybe reach out to a forum of bilingual English/your language-speakers to see if there's a better way to translate?

Beyond that, it seems like he has some interpretation and communication issues himself if he lashes out, even if it's based on perceived (or actual) attacks from you. Is he a native English speaker? Has he ever sought counseling to deal with his angry reactions? Regardless of culture or language, it's generally healthier if you can manage your anger in a way that doesn't lead to you screaming or demeaning people around you.  Honestly, you need professional help. Counselling is not cheap but it is less expensive than divorce (and better than a lifetime of unhappiness). If you're religious, you may be able to find a clergy member who has training or experience with counselling who will see you for free. Even if you're not, if you're truly unable to afford counselling, you might find one who will help you. I'm not religious, but I would have no problem sending a friend to most of the Unitarian or Episcopalian ministers I've met if they needed help.

*edited to make the prose flow better; as long as I'm editing, I'll point out that what he means is more important than the specific words he uses. We aren't religious, and reddit is my free help. In fact, we are atheists in a completely evangelical Christian community. It is impossible to talk to someone without mentioning God, it scares me, and angers me. I love getting free advice on Reddit too and have learned a lot from it but there is *no* comparison with going to a therapist. I hope you find a way to see a professional who can help you with this situation. I hope the kind of professional I need, actually exists. Everyone I've ever spoken to always brings up God. I'm an atheist, they can't accept that, and they ask me to find God. Every professional you've ever spoken to? Ugh. Totally not cool. Coming from an atheist who's also a former therapist. Keep looking til you find someone who can keep their God out of your couples or indv counseling. And hang in there dear!! Thanks. On top of that, I believe in the healing power of cannabis and fungi, and it's tough not being able to speak to them about it even if it's about positive experiences... whenever I mention it, they ask me to go to meetings, etc. Total bummer. We need more free spirited therapists! Most therapists would probably consider that self-medicating? I don't know. But you can combine your coping skills to include talking too. I hope you find an open-minded person who will help. We aren't religious, and reddit is my free help. In fact, we are atheists in a completely evangelical Christian community. It is impossible to talk to someone without mentioning God, it scares me, and angers me.  I'm not even halfway through the first paragraph, and I already know you should leave him.

Okay, read the rest. He's being verbally and emotionally abusive. Seek couples' counseling, preferably with someone who's bilingual in your native tongue. If he refuses to go to counseling, please leave. You can talk to people at [Love is Respect](http://www.loveisrespect.org/) and they'll help you find resources in your area or even just give you a shoulder to cry on.  
  
How he's treating you isn't OK. This has the classic abuse signs all over it.  People who are being abused always say "well when he isn't drunk/angry/sad he is the most caring and loving guy!"  Those things just don't cancel each other out.  It also makes me so sad that people in these relationships always question themselves first, as if they're the one to blame for the psychotic behavior of another. His behaviour is abusive, **not** psychotic which is not synonym with angry,violent,mean or plain abusive. Psychotic is also colloquially used to mean "crazy," as in, when someone overreacts in an overly angry, accusative manner. "Psychotic" in this case, fits the colloquial definition, not the clinical definition.  This has the classic abuse signs all over it.

To be fair, someone we used to live with heard him call me a cunt and spoke to him about it and he hasn't done it since. It's been a few months since that.

He really isn't a bad husband, he doesn't hit, he's fairly considerate, and other than when he's upset, he's very caring. I hope he doesn't actually think the worst of me.

It upsets me that it's not just me that's being affected by this negatively.  &amp;gt;I haven't told any of my friends or family how upset I am, I would never want them to think he ever makes me anything but happy... but I don't know what to do anymore. 

But . . . it sounds like he does make you feel unhappy at least sometimes. You seem to believe what he says about you being or sounding evil, and I doubt thinking that you're "evil" makes you happy . . . so you don't want anyone to know the truth that he makes you unhappy sometimes? Why?

&amp;gt;We can not afford any counseling or therapy.

Perhaps you can call a local women's hotline. They can sometimes put you in-touch with cheap or free counseling. What country/region do you live in? &amp;gt;so you don't want anyone to know the truth that he makes [me] unhappy sometimes? why?

My parents are divorced and I am their only child together, they both love me very much and worry even more. My family is very traditional, I'm pretty sure that anyone that got married did so after college (I haven't graduated and am not able to afford school again yet). They also don't move more than two hours away from everyone they know.

I don't always get to talk to my parents so the last thing I want is for them to only hear me being sad, when 90% of the time, I'm not. So you don't think that you're evil or bad or deserving of your husband's treatment of you? And you don't feel bad when he tells you such things?

Does he apologize or take it back when he's calmed down? No I don't think I'm evil or deserving of that, but I don't think he deserves what I throw back at him either. I feel bad, yeah, so did my mom when I used to yell at her. :/ I don't yell at her anymore. Yeah, he apologizes, and he talks to me about what's upsetting him. It sounds like you both need counseling. It's usually not good for adults to repeatedly insult and belittle each other, even if it's only out of occasional anger. 

It sounds like you both need to work on managing your anger, and talking things out instead of saying hateful things like children. If you've tried avenues of getting cheap or free counseling with no luck, maybe do some research online and try to practice controlling your anger and calming yourself down. If he's really a good guy, he will be open to working on his anger using similar resources.  &amp;gt; What can I do to stop sounding so evil?

You've internalised your oppression. You believe that you are at fault because he says so. He has broken you, you are his willing chattel, _game over_.

Unless you leave his ass for basically brainwashing you into blaming yourself for whatever he decides is the theme of the night, because he commanded you to do so. Leave him. _Leave him right now._

You might not see it right now, but this man is evil and poisonous to you. Your only chance to ever be happy in life is to leave him before he reinforces your _domestication_ further and your Stockholm syndrome becomes so ingrained that he could stab you to death and you'd blame yourself.

Cause you now what, unless you leave, that could actually, realistically, happen. Because basically right now you're already crying in the corner, nursing the bruises on your face while wondering why you just can't be the perfect wife he wants. "...and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt."

ahaha, sorry, totally reminded me of Taking Back Sunday.

Well, that might be one way, but as I explained in the comment I wrote before I refreshed and saw this message, it might be the rare case where it's not that way. He's still human, and every human I've ever known lashes out a tiny bit when they're upset about something.

The person I was replying to asked how often we fight and here was my answer:
&amp;gt;I would say not very often. I notice that we only really fight when there is something that stresses him out. Before, it was the people we lived with. Then when we moved, it was that neither of us could find work and we were drowning in debt. When we both found work, we'd be fine unless his health started to go down, that was pretty stressful for both of us. Nobody wants to be in pain, nobody wants to see their husband in pain. On top of that, we can't afford health insurance and so the bills stack sky high, which can be stressful to anyone in our situation. His dad has been acting funny lately... he thinks his dad is keeping something from him about his health. He's worried his dad is dying, basically. &amp;gt; and every human I've ever known lashes out a tiny bit when they're upset about something.

Um, what you described is not "a tiny bit" - it's a lot. He doesn't get to call you names, degrade you, or make you believe you're evil because he's a tiny bit upset. He doesn't even get to do that if he's really upset. This man is verbally abusing you and manipulating your emotions.

My boyfriend gets upset some times. He tells me why he is upset, and we talk through it to find a solution. He would never call me names because *he respects me*. You deserve respect, too. Don't wait until it's too late - get out and find support now.  That sounds terrifying. But I hardly think I'm Carol (from the Walking Dead). I understand the respect you're talking about, I've had past relationships with some people who have given me the utmost respect in any and every situation... and unfortunately, I can not always say I gave them the same amount of respect in return. They've pointed out to me a few times about how harsh my words can be... but I honestly did not feel any disrespect for them at all. I only ever spoke in the way that I've been ever been spoken to or occasionally what I've seen in movies or TV. He had a rough childhood, it's how he is. But he has never put a hand on me. Just remember not all types of abuse are physical.  Emotional abuse can be just as devastating and long lasting.  Also remember that abuse tends to escalate, and even though he is not hitting you now, he might in the future if he gets really mad.  If you keep following this pattern of blaming yourself, by the time he gets around to hitting you you'll be wondering what you did to deserve it... That sounds terrifying. But I hardly think I'm Carol (from the Walking Dead). I understand the respect you're talking about, I've had past relationships with some people who have given me the utmost respect in any and every situation... and unfortunately, I can not always say I gave them the same amount of respect in return.

But he has never put a hand on me. &amp;gt;They've pointed out to me a few times about how harsh my words can be... but I honestly did not feel any disrespect for them at all.

Even if you didn't intend disrespect, if it is disrespectful, it is disrespectful. "Cunt" for example, is never anything but disrespectful (except maybe if you're using it in Australian slang). Right, that's understandable, I'm seeing, from people who did not grow up in my family. If we don't mean disrespect, it is disrespectful, but not unforgivable and is something that is easy to understand. We are very close, my family, but the elders are harsh and speak to us in that manner. We as the younger generation have told them how it makes us feel, and we know that they love and care for us very much, but they are set in their ways. That is all we learned so that is all we give. We are a traditional culture that's only recently being mixed with American culture. I am not even first generation American. It's just a difference in culture, is what I think is so hard to grasp for most of the people here. &amp;gt;It's just a difference in culture, is what I think is so hard to grasp for most of the people here.

Possibly. But just because something is traditional does not make it right or good or even acceptable. You seem to see that to some extent based on your efforts to change the way you speak and deal with anger (and hopefully aim to help your husband speak and deal with his anger).

I'm lucky, in some ways, to not have had too many elders with bad habits from old traditions, and to have had a strong mother who readily rejected those few bad traditions that remained in my family. I could see how it would be harder to find the "best" way to deal with relationships if I hadn't had that, though. 

You seem to have a decent head on your shoulders, though, and can tell right from wrong and healthy relationship or reaction from unhealthy based on the fact that you're asking for help to improve the situation. The main issue seems to be that you're mainly asking for help on changing yourself, though, without asking for help on how to get him to not overreact. 

Even if my boyfriend said something I perceived as insulting or as "trying to keep me from my family," I would not scream at him or insult him, nor would I accept that behavior from him. Relationships are a two-way street, and improvement must come from both directions. "...and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt."

ahaha, sorry, totally reminded me of Taking Back Sunday.

His dad has been acting funny lately... he thinks his dad is keeping something from him about his health. He's worried his dad is dying, basically. GNsecret below me said it best. But I want you to re-read the comment I'm replying to, and please notice how now you started to downplay his abuse, and how you are _defending his indefensible behaviour_.  I wouldn't say indefensible. Maybe in a different culture, but in my culture, when someone does something wrong, people get really mad. I get really mad. He's stopped calling me any names (except he's described me as evil recently when I was yelling at him). What I wouldn't tolerate is if he ever raised a hand on me (which he hasn't). I successfully defended myself and left in a previous relationship for that reason before. This isn't that situation though. English may be your second language, but you seem to have a pretty good command of it from what I've been reading. Given that you're _married_ to this guy, I would hope that he understands that English is your second language and attempts to deal with the quirks and more that come with multilingualism/culturalism.

If this language/culture quirk of yours keeps causing you problems _elsewhere_ I would suggest practicing speech patterns you hear on things like TV shows and movies and perhaps go to something like Toastmasters and other speaking/public speaking/singing type meetings. I like to watch movies and shows with subtitles when I learn a new language because it helps me understand and speak more "legitimately" than the slow paced and occasionally outrageous formal language spoken in courses that of course also excludes slang, accents, and regional speech patterns. Getting feedback from other people on what I'm doing is also helpful - I took some singing courses a while back and that's helped me figure out breathing and emphasis a bit better during normal speech.

Last but not least - abuse comes in multiple forms. Apologizing and changing abusive behavior does not mean it's the end of it - he never should have name called and there is never justification for lashing out for no reason _towards you_ even for a reason like "he thinks his dad is dying". Unless he can meet you somewhere in the middle (mostly towards your end) on this problem you think you have, you two are desperately in need of couples counseling more than anything else. If you cannot find resources online, may I suggest local free clinics and even Planned Parenthood might be able to help if not refer you to someone else that isn't religious?

I'm not in your shoes, but I grew up in two cultures speaking two languages. I have my own language/culture quirks. I've never had anyone yell at me because of them, I only have them asking for clarification at most. It's not okay to justify bad behavior because of this, and it's really not something that takes years to understand at a basic level. You may not even be that bad with your English all things considered, but you may not see it because you're in an echo chamber with no family and local outsiders to ask.


Oh yeah, and that a bunch of outsiders are telling you "abuse!" should be a huge warning sign for you. Please don't just cherrypick what you want to read. I appreciate your advice, sincerely. I learned to mimic the way people speak from a young age to try and fit in. The problem is I've never, ever seen movies, shows, or read books where any character is dealing with a negative real-life situation in a way that isn't crazy sounding (for lack of a better description. Normally, people who I see that get angry go crazy no matter what age, sex, race, or creed. Either that or they have some kind of knowledge of the future that they're withholding from the person they are arguing with and can keep their cool because of it. I can hear where I sound harsh, but don't know how to remedy it. There are no words or tones yet in my vocabulary, etc that will allow me to replace that behavior.

I wish there were a planned parenthood nearby. I don't think this valley would allow it.  It sounds like a very broken relationship. I know that English isn't your first language and I understand that it can be difficult with tone and easy to let things slip when you have two people with different mother tongues. 

I'm assuming you're Asian because you mentioned tone? 

I can tell you this. Healthy marriages don't include name calling even on the worst days. Yes, couples do fight and they get over it but I assure you being called a cunt or evil is not the norm and if it's something he's doing in front of other people he's totally unaware of how inappropriate it is and surely will escalate. 

His reaction about your family is odd and defensive. If you can't afford therapy please consider leaving. You only get one life and I'd really recommend spending it with someone who respects you.   I get that you want to sound less harsh, and maybe your tone really is conveying a stronger emotion than you intend, but *that doesn't justify his reactions.* If anything, you're both in the wrong. If there genuinely is something socially inappropriate about how you're speaking to him, *he should be helping you correct your behavior*, not lashing out in a fit of explosive rage. That is not appropriate it any relationship, in my opinion, and it is certainly not constructive to addressing this issue (if it genuinely is an issue). Marriage is about partnership. You should be helping each other grow, and he is *not* doing that.   Jesus christ you people are so dramatic. Someone seriously called you "willing chattel" because your husband and you get in fights over your tone.

I know, I've been there. I have a 'bitch voice' in that I always sound sarcastic or snide or whatever, even when I'm just asking a question. It happens. Sensitive people pick up on it, usually I say "that's just how I sound" and they get over it. My boyfriend knows this. He knows I'm not being a jerk. Your husband should, too. 

Next time he tries to blow up over something that you KNOW isn't actually a big deal just say "Please don't blow up at me" and then just don't engage his questions or accusatory statements like "WTF I'm not trying to keep you from your family!!!"

All you have to do is repeat "no, that's not what I was saying. Please don't blow up at me" and be CALM and collected and cool and nice (but not an apologetic doormat, remember you've actually done nothing wrong)

He's being a dick. You should sit him down, have a REAL serious talk about how your tone or the way you phrase things doesn't give him license to yell at you. Inform him that you will no longer respond to yelling or name calling or fighting and if he wants to speak with you you'll only talk when he is calm and rational. Tell him when he starts yelling or being angry and mean you will simply say "please don't blow up at me" and not respond again until he cools down.

Do you think you can do this? I thought I was going crazy for a minute. I'm so glad I'm not the only one after all. I don't hang out with my family members so I have no idea if they're going through the same thing with the way they say things, etc. My mom always complained about my tone, I always complained about hers, but we just learned to live with each other after we understood that we just speak that way, we don't mean to hurt feelings, etc.

He should know, but we've only been married for a little over a year, and have known each other for only two. I'm still learning how to read him, it's likely he's still learning how to read me. But each time, we both improve SOMETHING. Which is not NOTHING, I've seen people go around in circles their entire relationship, that's not what's going on here.

That's sound advice, and I will take it. After all, I can't expect him to learn how not to react if I don't make an effort, myself. I don't know if you read my other comments, but I have a fairly hot temper, myself. You need to not react to his yelling or engage him in afight when he senses that you're being snotty or snippy or short with him. Your tone can be largely unconscious and you can't control how he will react, only how you react. If you refuse to get angry and refuse to yell and fight, and just calmly repeat "Please don't blow up at me" and "no, that's not what I was saying" it could help him see that his behavior is inappropriate.

Don't engage him until he is calm and DO NOT yell yourself Yeah, you're right. I've done that before and it did help. I guess it had been so long since we fought, we both forgot to work on it. :P Quality problem, eh? Thank you though, seriously. [deleted] they can't afford therapy it's not worth suggesting if she's going to disregard it Many churches offer couples counseling. They're not religious

 well they're not she said they're atheists and they don't attend church and don't want to.

Actually, one person on here helped out a lot. :) [deleted] Yeah, you're right. I've done that before and it did help. I guess it had been so long since we fought, we both forgot to work on it. :P Quality problem, eh? Thank you though, seriously. You're welcome. It takes a lot of maturity and self restraint not to yell back at someone that starts yelling at you. It's really hard to do. Don't beat yourself up because you may slip up and start fighting back with mean words or yelling or calling him names or passive aggressive snide remarks or whatever. The goal is to completely refuse to do anything but stay calm (once he starts yelling) and repeat your point in a nice but short tone ("no that's not what I meant, please don't blow up at me, I'll talk about this only without yelling etc") 

It helps to stay calm. Once you start yelling too all hell breaks loose. Just calm down and try to have a rational talk (most loud yelling fights sound silly and trivial once you actually sit down to talk them out anyway) &amp;gt;It helps to stay calm.

Yeah it's always better once we both stopped yelling. It's hard though, sometimes I say things firmly and he accuses me of yelling at him which sets me off... etc etc. But I have to stop if I ever expect him to, right? Only fair. Jesus christ you people are so dramatic. Someone seriously called you "willing chattel" because your husband and you get in fights over your tone.

I know, I've been there. I have a 'bitch voice' in that I always sound sarcastic or snide or whatever, even when I'm just asking a question. It happens. Sensitive people pick up on it, usually I say "that's just how I sound" and they get over it. My boyfriend knows this. He knows I'm not being a jerk. Your husband should, too. 

Next time he tries to blow up over something that you KNOW isn't actually a big deal just say "Please don't blow up at me" and then just don't engage his questions or accusatory statements like "WTF I'm not trying to keep you from your family!!!"

All you have to do is repeat "no, that's not what I was saying. Please don't blow up at me" and be CALM and collected and cool and nice (but not an apologetic doormat, remember you've actually done nothing wrong)

He's being a dick. You should sit him down, have a REAL serious talk about how your tone or the way you phrase things doesn't give him license to yell at you. Inform him that you will no longer respond to yelling or name calling or fighting and if he wants to speak with you you'll only talk when he is calm and rational. Tell him when he starts yelling or being angry and mean you will simply say "please don't blow up at me" and not respond again until he cools down.

Do you think you can do this?  The fact that you're asking us how you can seem less evil in this situation...that's not a good sign.  Because you're not being or sounding "evil," based on anything you're saying here.  

I think that, if nothing else, you do need to come clean to your family and friends about this.  I think you'd be surprised to find that they may find he's being a dick about this too.  They should be allowed to know how he treats you. Of course they would, but they think they are perfect and nobody else is. They can't own up to when they are overreacting, trust me, it's better if they don't know, as they will overreact, and not even in my opinion, they will overreact from anyone's point of view. They sent me to live across the country in the middle of high school because my aunt caught me talking to a boy on the sidewalk after school (no joke). Oif.  Yeah, this is not the support network for you I was hoping for.  

But what he's doing is NOT ok.  I don't know if you've heard enough of us here saying it to believe it yet.   I tend to believe people who are like me in a given situation, like the folks who also have a bad habit of sounding too harsh, or have grown up with a similar family or a similar situation. Thing is ... sounding too harsh isn't exactly raping babies or committing genocide.  "Hey, are you as angry as you sound?" would be an appropriate way for him to react.  "You are evil" is not -- that's him attacking.   A lot of people are getting hung up on his choice of words. I've called him stupid before (which is far from what he is). It's easier to throw harsh words when we're upset, we both literally need to learn how to pick nicer words.  Why are you married to someone who thinks you're evil?  First of all, disregard all these people on this thread telling you to leave your husband.  That's TwoX's default answer, because its the easiest answer that makes people feel good about themselves that they gave the "right" answer. 

The real answer is that people from other cultures talk differently.  Oftentimes, people from foreign countries speak with a tone that seems hostile or aggressive to Americans, even if they don't mean.  Foreigners are often much more emotional, expressive, and louder which comes off to Americans as threatening.  Also, Americans have a thing called "tact", where you can say an unpleasant thing but you say it in a way that sounds nice.  A lot of foreign cultures don't have this, or if they do, their version of "tact" is different from American's version of tact.  So when foreigners talk, it often sounds much more blunt and direct than when Americans talk, so people take it as disrespectful or impolite.  

But also, like everybody else in this thread is saying, your boyfriend may have other issues and he is using your tone as a pretext for starting fights with you.  I have no way of knowing.  While I expect foreigners may have problems being understood correctly by strangers, you'd think _her husband_ would get what's going on at least on a basic level. It may take years to get to a point where you just know how to deal with it instantly, but it doesn't take years to learn that someone is used to a whole different set of speech patterns and behaviors. And why not arguments like "why are you asking so aggressively" instead of calling her a cunt?

I also don't think that if it was just a speech/tact issue, she'd post exclusively about her husband's reactions (ESPECIALLY that first example, which if that quote is word for word I can't possibly comprehend it resulting in yelling back). I would have expected her to pull out random encounters with strangers too. But she doesn't do that anywhere that I can see...only some example of her telling family members something. It may not take years to learn that someone else is used to a different set of speech patterns but what if their "normal" is calling you stuff like stupid, useless etc? Calling people that is completely normal in Chinese culture but if you hear your Chinese wife calling you that over and over, you're not going to sit there and say "okay, I'll just give you 20 years to fix that and pretend everything is normal."

If you read her OP's other posts, you'd realize that she did mention that other people have told her that her tone is terrible and that she too gets rage-y in heated arguments. You have a good point, but the specific examples she gives out (if she recalled correctly, even) don't make it sound like that's always the case. And it's possible to be ragey without getting to that point. Plus, it's one thing if her husband said "you sound terrible" or "you're so angry when you talk" and she's asking for help but another if he's calling her a cunt on top of that.

It's really hard to say what OP should do without having been there. There's a bunch of ways to interpret what's going on. If it is the case she's like your example then we've all blown it, because she does need to fix some of her speech patterns before it blows up into something worse. But I feel like a lot of comments here already took that kind of possibility into account and still found the husband lacking. Not to seem rude but what OP is talking about is on the larger scale of immigrants faced with communicating in the majority language (English, which is not their best medium) while at the same time interacting with a foreign culture which has its own but different set of rules regarding behavior, expectations, and mannerisms. 95% of 2X didn't pick any of that up. And it's not a minor detail.  The comment of mine you originally replied to was a tl;dr version of another longer one. What wasn't mentioned was that I'm second generation Korean in the US and I grew up between two cultures speaking two languages. I really grew up sandwiched between even more because of how diverse my friends were in the city I grew up in (Los Angeles), and I ran into lots more culture clash while learning other languages (Spanish, French, Mandarin), but that was to varying degrees and not quite as immediate or as immersive as my Korean/American upbringing was.

Regardless of what you think of my qualifications, I think I understand the OP's situation to the extent that you don't believe me to because I've experienced it firsthand and seen it firsthand. I know it's a big detail, I know it's a problem, I know it's something OP should work on, but I'm just saying I don't think it's unreasonable to ask her husband of all people to have a little understanding of these things. You have a good point, but the specific examples she gives out (if she recalled correctly, even) don't make it sound like that's always the case. And it's possible to be ragey without getting to that point. Plus, it's one thing if her husband said "you sound terrible" or "you're so angry when you talk" and she's asking for help but another if he's calling her a cunt on top of that.

But I feel like a lot of comments here already took that kind of possibility into account and still found the husband lacking. What's so wrong about "you're being such a cunt right now" if she really is being...kinda of.. cunty? Like maybe I'm just a little more thick skinned or something but that doesn't really strike me as any different than "you sound terrible" except for the fact that 'stop being such a cunt' is way more realistic First of all, disregard all these people on this thread telling you to leave your husband.

But also, like everybody else in this thread is saying, your boyfriend may have other issues and he is using your tone as a pretext for starting fights with you.  I have no way of knowing.      Sometimes, couples fight and are not that nice to each other.   

I understand the tone thing perfectly.  I too came from a family that was just not really all that *nice* to each other.  My parents weren't super happy together, and the way my mom spoke to my dad was really harsh.  It does rub off.  I have been in relationships before where I thought of myself as loving and supportive, but have been told by my partners that I was mean and doubting.  I never meant to be mean but sometimes those things you learn in childhood are hard to shake.  It does hurt to be told that you are harsh or mean, especially when that isn't what you intend to do at all.  

Here is my advice:

* Don't let it shake your self-confidence.  Remember that you are not a bad/mean person.  You have been shaped by your past, and that is not a bad thing.  You are lovable, and the first step towards a healthy relationship is to love yourself.  

* Contemplate where the statement you made was coming from. Was it from a place that was not love?  Was it a product of some deeper problem that you have with the relationship or your partner? If he feels like you were implying with tone that he is lazy, ask yourself "do I think he is lazy?"

* Try to empathize.  Why did it make him feel bad?  Did you say something that made him feel unloved?  Did he feel like you don't believe in him? How would you feel if someone you loved spoke to you in a mean way?  How did it feel when your elders spoke to you in a harsh way? Though you didn't intend to hurt him, don't disregard the fact that he feels hurt.
 
* Try to view the conversation from the eyes of a stranger.  Do you think if you overheard the way you were speaking you would feel uncomfortable?  One of the biggest eye openers for me was overhearing other couples that spoke to each other with a nasty tone.  I realized "oh my gosh.. that's me." It really helped me recognize how the things I said might sound to others, even when I didn't mean it.  
* remember you are both only human.      
* Couples counseling.  I know you said you can't afford it, but one of the main things you can learn there that will help you is nonviolent communication skills.  It sounds like the root of the problem here is bad communication skills.  He doesn't like the way you speak to him and feels it is mean, and you don't like the way he deals with his anger and calls names and cuts you down.  He needs to be given the tools to express his feelings to you in a gentle and productive way.  People do get angry, and when we don't understand how to properly express ourselves, nasty words come out of our mouths.  Many many people are not given the tools to deal with anger, and need to learn them in adulthood.

           
If he really is a decent guy like you say, he will understand that his behavior is both unacceptable and unproductive.  Evaluate whether things change with the help of a professional, and if not, it may be time to accept that the relationship must end for both of your happiness. 

Woah...that was long.  Sorry.         It's not you. You're not evil, you're not a cunt and you're not a bitch. It's him. I don't know what exactly is wrong with him or what made him this way, but IT IS DEFINITELY HIM. Please, don't think it's your fault or anything you're doing wrong and maybe if you can fix it he will be nice to you. No, he won't. Ever. Doesn't matter what you do. You can't fix something that is wrong so deep in him. 

How many years of this? It's time to leave, especially if you don't have kids yet, leave. If you do have kids, do it for them, they don't need to grow up seeing their mom be called a cunt and a bitch for no reason.      What ethnicity are you?

My mother (she's Chinese) reminds me of you. She has this thing where she'll put up a bitch face and her attitude is off the charts pissy and she thinks she's speaking normally.

She's not. And honestly, as her daughter, there have been moments where I cannot put up with that type of treatment. Your husband, who loves you, could be feeling the same thing.

I know that Chinese (the language) is very subtle and that when you translate it into English (think subtitles) it comes off as practically abusive. Sometimes making a direct translation will appear to be very harsh when the meaning in Chinese is not. 

While perhaps your English may be shaped by your family, his English is shaped by his family who may use softer word choice.  I'm from the Philippines. My entire family is that way, I still don't feel comfortable talking to some of my other family members because of it. I certainly don't want my husband to feel that way. I need lessons on the softer words though. I do not know anything about Filipino customs however one thing about the English language is the tendency for women to ask questions instead of stating something.

For example: if you wanted to go to the store, you're supposed to say (to your husband) "Did you want to go to the store?" rather than "I want to go to the store" (which is what you would say in Chinese). I personally find that demeaning as I feel that I shouldn't need to hint and should be allowed to say what I want to say with conviction so instead I say something like "I need eggs. Can we go to the store later?"

Not sure if that helps!  I think you guys have communication issues.  

My husband and I get snippy with each other on occasion and it's usually because he does something that I interpret to mean one thing, but that was not his intention and vice versa.  

Example:  We were watching The Hunger Games and I was balling my eyes out, but husband keeps giggling.  I thought he was laughing at me, so I pause the movie and asked him why he's laughing at me.  He said he was trying to keep from crying himself, and had to make himself laugh instead.

Granted, your husband shouldn't be exploding whenever there is a miscommunication and you should talk to him about that.  He knew coming into the marriage that there would be cultural and language issues, so if he can't sit down and try to work through problems calmly and rationally where you both get a chance to speak AND be heard, then he has an anger problem.

Trying to stop "sounding evil" isn't going to work.  Maybe he gets upset by your bluntness and thinks you are being mean-spirited, but if you explain that really isn't the case and you just meant x or y, then he needs to try to understand that.  

Good luck! Gotcha. Sounds doable, I mean, we were working on that for a while and it had been so long since we fought I guess we just went back to how we always were on our own. Yeah, marriages take a lot of upkeep and day-to-day work.  
You sound intelligent and admit that you don't know him like the back of your hand.  The truth is that you most likely never will and that's not really a bad thing.  People grow and change constantly.  That's why you have to keep the communication lines open and accesible. &amp;gt;You sound intelligent

Hey, thanks! I get that a lot when I'm not getting dead silence and stares from the crazy-sounding thing I just said. -_-; haha

I agree with you though. It's a communication thing. I guess I should've been more clear in the post, we both have issues when we're upset and I'm just trying to find a way to stop myself from sounding harsh so I can help him, too.</snippet></document><document><title>I'm tired of mechanics talking to me like I'm a child just because I happen to have a vagina.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bypg/im_tired_of_mechanics_talking_to_me_like_im_a/</url><snippet>Both my roommate and I have had a lot of car trouble recently, so I've been in and out of mechanic shops and autozone a lot these past few weeks. I'm a nuclear engineering student, so I understand engines and generators and mechanics in general. And I "helped" my dad with basic car fixes when I was younger--even though I was probably just in the way, my father was happy to teach me. I get the basics, I take good care of my car. I'm no mechanic and I'm still working on figuring everything out (taking my mostly theoretical nuclear knowledge and applying it to a small combustion engine that makes wheels spin), but I'm getting there. And I'm proud of myself for learning and of my father for both teaching me about cars and sending me to ballerina school (even though that didn't go so well.)

But all that pride just makes me angry and sad when I take my car in and a mechanic calls me "sweetie," tries to rip me off, and talks to me like I'm a child whose only knowledge of science is that cakes turn solid when put in an oven.

And it's frustrating when I take my car into our local mechanic and my father comes with (because I know I get better service with him there) and *they won't talk to me about my own damm car.* Hi there, I'm the owner of the car and the one who has noticed a problem. Please listen to me. My issue is not more valid when it comes from the mouth of my father.

So I have to choose between being ripped off and demeaned alone or being ignored for the sake of good service with whatever man I can recruit to go with me.

I wish I could condem one company or one mechanic, but, rather, there is only one mechanic that I feel has treated me with respect and fairness. (Though most of the local autozone employees have been good to me.) He's getting all my business from now on. Even if I have to pay more for my oil change or do it myself, I'm done with mechanics who treat me like shit.  As a female with mechanical experience (worked on everything from VW bugs to semis) I have experienced the opposite of this. Men would bring their cars in and once they saw a female mechanic out came the, "You can't work on my car," or "do you know what you're doing?"

So, one particular gentleman would insist he knew what was wrong with his car and that my delicate female brain couldn't be trusted with his shitty Buick.  So my manager pulled his car around and handed him his keys. He asked what was happening and was told this,

"You have three choices. You can go somehwere else and get it fixed. You can have my best mechanic who is a female to fix it. Or, you can fix it yourself since you're a guy and obviously that means we all know mechanics, right?"

He turned four shades of red and sputtered that he isn't a mechanic and can't fix it. My boss, who was a biker looking beefy dude, said "then sit down and let this woman fix what you obviously can't, sir."

The look of confusion, embarrassment and humiliation on his face was priceless. That's beautifu. :D

Even though that guy was a jackass, it makes me happy to know that there's people like you and your boss.

Now rare are female mechanics? I'd love to find one around here, but I don't even know how other than calling up everywhere and asking. Where are you located? 

If you'd like. Pm me your location and I'll see if we can't find you a female owned garage (becoming more popular) or one with female mechanics. Where are you located?

If I found I had a simple issue I could fix I would buy the parts and do it myself (for ex. I replaced my 02 sensor.) Doing these types of things allowed me to become more educated about my vehicle and therefore give me an 'edge' if I had to actually take it in for service. If I were you the next time you have an issue, do all you can to research it via the internet, books or from friends that are 'car savvy'. When you go to take the car in and you have to explain the issue, explain it in detail using the correct terminology to show them you know your shit.

If and when they call you to tell you they found another 'issue' or are trying to get you to pay for something extra simply tell them you want to come in and you want them to take you back to your car and show you the problem.

Trust me, I know how frustrating it can be to not be taken seriously or to not be treated as a human being all because you have a vagina (I work in a male dominated industry) but go out there and show em' who's boss!

Hey, your post is inspiring! Could you teach me more about how to do this? I got started from the askreddit thread about mechanics yesterday, and I spent today getting dad to show me the basics - how to change tyres, to do a tyre rotation, which fluids to check, how to jump start the car... but he doesn't know everything, and I'd like to take my knowledge further.

How did you get started? I don't have any friends that are 'car savvy,' unfortunately. Are there any decent books that you could recommend to learn this sort of thing? I heard about the Haynes manuals, but I can't find one for my car's particular make/model. I have a 1998 Ford Laser, but the manuals only go up to 1996, and the car depicted on the cover looks very different. I've been going through the Car Bible website, but I'd love a book with a set list of practical projects or maintenance tasks I could undertake for my car. Hi there! You're best bet would be to start learning about the basics and innerworkings of cars in general. This might seem silly but asking the question 'How does a car work?' is really your best starting point; this [site](http://www.partsgeek.com/mmparts/how_cars_work.html) has a lot of good beginner resources.

As far as a Haynes manual goes I wasn't able to find anything on that make/model for the year you specified as well however I would suggest going into your local auto parts store and asking if they know of a repair manual you could purchase, or if the 1996 one is considered an equivalent. Generally I've found these guys to be a bit friendlier as they tend to be younger and are happy to have any ladies coming into the shop:)

With all of that being said there aren't really any projects that come to mind however doing the basic maintenance on your car (which you've mentioned above) is a great start. I didn't really start getting my hands dirty until my car started having problems. Once that happens I'd recommend doing research on what you think the issue is (car forums for your cars make are a great resource) and once you've discovered the issue do further research to find out if that particular issue is truly DIY (i.e. you don't need to remove the entire engine or hike the car up to a significant height to get to the components needed)

Also, if you get a 'check engine light' you can purchase a 'Code Reader' link [here](http://www.amazon.com/Actron-ACTCP9125-OBD-POCKET-SCAN/dp/B003YNFOMY/ref=sr_1_5?s=automotive&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1360681997&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=actron+pocketscan+code+reader) that you simply plug into your car. This device analyzes the code and returns a result displaying the issue that triggered the check engine light. If you don't have the funds to purchase that you can always go into a Pepboys (or generally the equivalent) and they will read the code for you for free.

Hope this helps!! Yes, thanks, this is exactly the kind of advice I was hoping for! I need to pick up some of my own tools, so I can enquire about the Haynes manual then. And I can't believe that fordlaser.com is a thing...! 

Thanks again. :)
  &amp;gt; a mechanic calls me "sweetie,&#8221;

If any vendor speaks to me in a less-than-respectful manner, I take my business elsewhere. I'd also complain to corporate. Let the heads roll! &amp;gt;I'd also complain to corporate. 

I only do that when someone manages to seriously piss me off.  I put that level of effort one step below filing a BBB complaint or going to small claims court.      Oh this infuriates me to no end.

There have been lots of studies done that consistently find that women are overcharged when buying cars and when having auto work done on their vehicles. 

I've even tried a couple of my own little experiments over the years. I've had my stepfather call up at an auto place and ask for a price quote on a part and/or installation/labor fee, and was told a price, that was invariably lower than when I showed up at the same place and asked for the same thing. 

I hate it, but it's just a fact of life, and sadly I mostly take my brother or bf with me to do car-related tasks because it saves a lot of trouble and money.    I'm sorry... that really sucks.  But I also really wish the mechanics that have done this could see it in feedback.  So many service shops have survey/review/feedback cards.  It would be great for them to see this, and to see that you aren't coming back!    The Autozone in my town is awesome. My husband deals with car stuff, not me, but the few times I've gone in there for something (wipers, headlight bulbs), the people were friendly and helpful and not all patronizing, and the staff seems pretty evenly split male and female.     This has happened to me too! Also with repair people who just so happen to be repair *men*. I once asked the THREE "repair"men what kind of tool they were using to fix the toilet in my apartment (why it took all 3 of them we may never know) so that maybe in the future we would know what to do and they responded "a special toilet tool" in a tone that suggested I could never understand how that worked. When probed further as to whether it was some sort of wrench (I'm pretty sure it was) they insisted further that it was "a special toilet tool." As someone who only ever receives actual tools for her toolbox from her father for christmas, I was a little put off by their response.


I would say we should all quit jumping to conclusions about people without knowing them but I'm sure I am guilty of the same and perhaps in some cases its useful? I don't know, but I'm wary of making extreme and unrealistic statements. This has happened to me too! Also with repair people who just so happen to be repair *men*.

I don't know, but I'm wary of making extreme and unrealistic statements.        When I was in college (back when my parents still owned my car), I desperately needed new tires and wasn't able to get back home to get them on since I lived so far away. So my dad called a local shop, negotiated and set up the price, and made an appointment time.

I took the car, came back a few hours later, and was about to pay. They said, "Oh, and it comes in to just under $400..." Right as I was freaking out and about to say "What?! My dad said it wouldn't be more than $200" they finished with "...at about $175." Then all six of the mechanics who were in the shop started cracking up.

Why is it okay for me to be teased just because I'm a girl? I know that 4 tires don't cost $400. Give me a break.  It isn't anything personal and it isn't anything you yourself don't do.

People make assumptions based on appearance every day. This is not limited to mechanics or even men. People make assumptions based on past experiences. Assumptions that for the most part are based on math. 

If on the average, women tend to be less familiar with cars than men, mechanics will often treat a woman differently than men. Of course some men know nothing about cars and some women can strip and rebuild an engine blindfolded. However probability points to the woman being less informed about cars.

Men, women, various races, creeds, people in various dress codes all tend to get treated differently based on how the average person sharing their traits are.  But that doesn't make it right. All of that can be sorted out if they simply asked *everyone*, "How much do you know about ____?"

Even if it could be *slighty* inconvenient, at least they're not being demeaning and reinforcing bullshit gender rolls.

Statistics doesn't justify sexism.  Why are you telling them you have a vagina? Well, they see the boobs and make assumptions. I assume.  It's because almost all women don't know the first thing about cars or anything mechanical and men generally know more. Doesn't make it right to assume based on gender, but it's true.

&amp;lt;--- Mechanic with years of experience on cars and airplanes

Also, don't know why you felt the need to bring up your education, being a student means you're still learning and likely have little to zero hands on knowledge of your field, and your field pretty much has nothing to do with anything car related, and engineers understand math and theory, but are shitty when it comes to actually changing parts. Most men don't know a whole lot about cars either... I never said they do know a lot, just in my several years of experience men are much more likely to know more than women. There isn't anything wrong with that, almost no women have any interest in vehicle maintenance and until very recently basic vehicle maintenance was something that was basically expected of men. [deleted] Almost everyone gets treated like idiots when they take their car in to get serviced or repaired, it's just more subtle with men. [deleted] So you don't want to not be treated like an idiot, you just want it to be more subtle. That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard.

2) No time to shower, put greasy hair in ponytail

3) Sick to stomach, breakfast of pear and celery goes uneaten. Wonder why sick to stomach. 

4) Due to foot, wear vibram fivefingers. To avoid looking silly, forgo comfortable skirt for jeans. 

5) Jeans are too small thanks to grad school. Hike 'em up and prepare to look like a ham smuggler all day

6) Can't find shirt, wear dirty hoodie you slept in.

7) Drive to Detroit

8) Find that the meeting you drove in for is cancelled

9) Go to bathroom, discover crotchal murder scene. Understand feeling sick to your stomach earlier.

10) Realize that you have no tampons. Apply paper towels to bleeding area, find females to beg from.

11) Realize you haven't used an applicator tampon in years

12) Insert tampon sideways. Fantastic.

13) Prepare to leave building to work from home for rest of day

14) Run into boss on way out of building, get invited to an 11am meeting. 

15) Realize you are starving. 

16) Overpay for breakfast from the nearby vegetarian friendly restaurant. Enjoy it anyway.

18) Really really wish you had time to poop

19) Sit through meeting

20) Leave Detroit, encounter detroit drivers

24) Give up on the next few hours out of sheer frustration and discomfort

25) Nap


If you follow these simple instructions you too could have a nap out of sheer unwillingness to face the world at 1pm on a Monday!   &amp;gt;12) Insert tampon sideways. Fantastic.

Oh, I can't IMAGINE it was comfortable.  Hell, I can't stand using a tampon if my ph balance is off, let alone having it in the wrong position.  I'm just thinking logistics here...

Then my entire abdomen starts hurting and then the pain settles in my right ovary, where I have an ovarian cyst as of a month ago.

I am so, so sorry. I almost got killed on the Lodge last night. Twice. I was on 94 right past the lodge interchange. It's like playing russian roulette every time I try to go home. High five for surviving the logde. That thing is like a cement walled death trap....so obviously everyone should go 90. All the time....
 I was laughing at my friend who was driving because she was actually obeying the speed limit signs. It became apparent that she really did not know where she was going, and sadly, I think her speed limit obeying is what almost got us killed. That'll do it. The bastards that fly up on you at 90 while you're actually going the speed limit, honk and swerve because *you're* the asshole here.... yes and then swerve violently right back in front of your car, barely missing the bumper because they're too busy giving you the finger to watch where they're going. You're a brave soul for navigating that route every day.  British Columbia (my province) just implemented a public holiday called Family Day. And it's today. 

My last week: worked 12 hour days to finish two massive technical manuals for my software development company. I'm the only technical writer/project manager they have (we're a small company). 

Had my midterm on Friday (horray). Stayed up all night before midterm. 

Planned to celebrate the entire weekend by watching movies with cookies. 

Friday evening--my vagina decides to run a late show of the Haunting. My entire Saturday is shot because the cramps are excruciating. Sunday, too. 

Today I'm feeling a little better, but pretty bummed out as it is my last day to enjoy myself before hitting the regular work week again. 

If it weren't for my desire to birth children from these loins, I would have done away with that uterus long ago.    Hugs... Life isn't always easy.      How to have a sucky life:

1) Grow up during wartime.

2) Realize you have no opportunities outside or inside your country.

3) Read trivial shite on Reddit and feel insanely jealous of first world problems.

4) ???

5) illegal emigration/drug trade, short period of finally being fiscally independent, prison/death

Two can play that game. Life can be shitty. I realize these are all first world problems, but yeah, it's what made my life shitty today. I've had better and worse shitty days, I wish you the best with yours. *megahugs* also, I realize I am first world, and while struggling, better off than a lot of people. What's your situation?

Maybe you should lay off so you don't get any fatter" in this kind of smirky-smug "I'm trying to be a charming asshole and it's failing so hard" way. 

I just stare at him because oh my god how fucking rude, right? I figured he was just some drunk assclown so I just kind of hoped he'd go away, but nope, he sits right beside me and orders a row of jager shots and keeps trying to force me to take them with him WHILE continually trying to touch my arm? Even if he wasn't a pile of shit I don't take drinks from strangers and especially not jager because fuck that awful liquor. 

I turned away and lit a cigarette to ward him off with smoke, and this dude fucking grabs my pack of cigarettes off the bar and holds it over my head and tells me that he's taking my cigarettes hostage and I have to "do something" for him to get them back. Now I live in a big city where cigarettes are expensive and I don't make a lot of money so I really couldn't afford to lose my pack so I agree to take a shot of jager (bad decision I know but what was I supposed to do?) 

From there on this guy is like layering weird little insult-compliments with forceful "suggestions" that we should go back to his place, and finally I have to be like "look dude I'm tired of whatever it is you're doing will you kindly fuck off" but that seemed to make him think I was playing hard to get? Finally my friend shows up and I use her as an easy out to GTFO this bar. 

How am I supposed to tell people doing this PUA bullshit to back off? If you tell them to fuck off they don't listen! Have you guys had any experience with this? 

Throwaway just in case a bunch of whiny PUA people show up and rain fire on this thread.   &amp;gt; I really couldn't afford to lose my pack so I agree to take a shot of jager (bad decision I know but what was I supposed to do?)

You turn to the bartender or bouncer and say "can you tell this motherfucker to leave me alone, please?  He's stolen my cigarettes." Yes, best way to deal with it. They don't want creeps to scare away female guests, and certainly not people who steal from others. Any interaction with guys like that is a point to him. Ignore. Ignore. Ignore.  Creepy men can definitely ruin a bar scene.  

I think sometimes women who aren't familiar with drinking assume that the establishment can be anti-woman too... wrong; bar owners love women and want to make them comfortable, because the more women frequent their establishment, the more business they get. I just saw an episode of Bar Rescue where the main guy threw out the owner's brother-in-law for being a creeper and making the female patrons uncomfortable. He then said a bar needs something like 70% of its business coming from women to stay in business. I liked him immediately. Did you also see the episode where he called out the bar owner on touching his female employees inappropriately?  He was fuming and all I could think was hell yeah, call out the creeper!  The show could have completely cut that out but instead shows him destroying this guy for being a sexual harasser. It made me sad to think how long they had been dealing with his shit (though luckily he retired and let his daughter take over by the end of the show). So, yeah, the guy in this show gets major points in my book.

You turn to the bartender or bouncer and say "can you tell this motherfucker to leave me alone, please?  He's stolen my cigarettes."

You turn to the bartender or bouncer and say "can you tell this motherfucker to leave me alone, please?  He's stolen my cigarettes." Exactly what I was thinking! At least, that's what I would do. Bartenders love to tell assholes to fuckoff :D They really don't.  They'll do it if the person is harassing other customers, but it's not something they enjoy. They really don't.  They'll do it if the person is harassing other customers, but it's not something they enjoy. They really don't.  They'll do it if the person is harassing other customers, but it's not something they enjoy. That hasnt been my experience. Every time I've been harassed by a drunk guy and I tell a bouncer or bartender they get a bit of a sly grin and typically go right over to deal with it. No eye rolls. Nothing to indicate they hate having to deal with the situation. I know a few bouncers and from what they told me, they'd prefer zero confrontations on every shift.  Granted, they know it's part of the job description but the few bouncers I know don't enjoy it.  It generally just leads to them having more problems than they would rather deal. Well. That hasnt been my experience. Like the last time I had something happen to me at a bar, I had caught a guy taking a creepshot of me (actually a guy friend of mine pointed it out to me) I reach around, and sure enough my thong was hanging out of my pants a bit. Told the bouncers, and they like "flew" into action on it and they certainly seemed glad to get rid of people like that. Both sides could be right.  Bouncers may not enjoy confrontation, but they might fly into action with glee if this is some asshole they have been desperate to toss but needed a complaint to instigate. Well. That hasnt been my experience.

You turn to the bartender or bouncer and say "can you tell this motherfucker to leave me alone, please?  He's stolen my cigarettes."  Things I have actually used that tend to work well:

- Roll your eyes and say, "Good god, why do guys honestly think negging will work?"  Then turn away.  Most of the time guys are so surprised they go into "defend negging" mode instead of "disavow that I was negging" mode.  Not only have you called them out, you've torn down their strategy since it only works if the target doesn't know about it.  Then you tell them to fuck off.

- Tell the bartender.  They have a vested interest in keeping their customers happy.  If one customer is harassing another, that's a booting (from the bar... not like actually physically kicking someone... ahem).

- Get rude.  Look him straight in the eye and say, "Go.  Away.  This is never going to work for you.  I don't want to talk to you, listen to you, or even god forbid realize you exist right now.  Go away."  Intersperse swear words if necessary.

- Loudly say, "Dude, leave me alone, please!  I don't want to talk to you!  Give me my stuff back!"  The louder you get, the better.  Public shame and humiliation - the dude is quite literally getting shot down in full view and hearing of EVERYONE - work wonders.

I've never tried negging someone because it sounds like a horrible way to interact with people. Though, I'm not convinced that it doesn't often work when not used in such a rude manner as this story. It's easy to ridicule as ineffective when you assume it's so obvious and easy to spot. However, people "neg" all the time in real life by accident, and I have to say, I've probably been in a situation where I wanted to prove myself because of a subtle seemingly innocent and benign slight. That makes me think that it's nearly impossible to spot if done in that natural way.   [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/1027/) has an excellent strategy.

I live in a university town, and deal with this type of attitude pretty often in bars (and other awkward places like libraries, coffee shops, the gym, etc). 

my favourite way to get rid of them is to look at them full in the face and say "pardon me?" in a polite but detached way. 9/10 they just say "never mind" because they've realized how colossally stupid it would be to repeat that awful line twice That's actually how I usually deal with it, too. Act like you didn't hear them the first time, and it immediately throws them off their game.

For some reason when I go out with my single friends I get this douche-nozzle type of attention from time to time. I try let guys know pretty early on in the conversation that I have a boyfriend so I'm not "leading them on" (cause it's unimaginable to just have a conversation with the opposite sex, every minute of the night MUST be dedicated to pulling) but for these types of guys it only makes them more determined. 

I have a sharp tongue and usually straight up tell them to fuck off if they're not getting the message and then I get called a bitch and that "I'm not that hot anyway" or as it is sometimes eloquently put here - "I wouldnt piss on you if you were on fire."

Fucking assholes.  Jesus CHRIST that guy sounds like the worst type of person. I would have literally been like "fuck off right now. Do not talk to me. Do not fucking dare." and just physically blanked him with my hand or something if he tried to open his mouth and make ANY other kind of statement. I know they don't listen to "fuck off" necessarily, but if you're literally just not responding to anything he does hopefully he'll get the picture. Either that or appeal to the barstaff and try and get him kicked out. 

That's just utterly disgusting behaviour. Again, I am so sorry.  My knee-jerk reaction to his first comment would have been, :blink blink: .... :throw beer in face: :D ..... :be sad about wasting my delicious beer: :(

Then, about ten minutes later I would have thought to retort with "Isn't telling girls what you think they should drink kind of douchey? Maybe you should lay off so you don't get thrown out." unfortunately that just gets YOU kicked out.

Then, about ten minutes later I would have thought to retort with "Isn't telling girls what you think they should drink kind of douchey? Maybe you should lay off so you don't get thrown out." Throwing drinks in his face after having cigarettes taken was my immediate reaction.  Should have turned his Jager shots against him! As offensive as this guy was, escalating to physical violence is never a good idea, especially when alcohol is involved. It's much better to alert the bar staff and let them handle it. As fragile as that guys ego probably is, a drink in his face might've resulted in a fist in heres, and he would've left feeling he was the victim. There are better ways to handle offensive behavior.  Throwing drinks in his face after having cigarettes taken was my immediate reaction.  Should have turned his Jager shots against him! Oh, no, I meant right at the start. Like, "Oh. Hm. You think I shouldn't be drinking this beer? I'll show you another a thing I can do with it! :D"

ETA: Realistically, I probably would have instantly thrown on the disapproving puppy-dog eyes and held my beer really defensively close, and been like, "But it's my beer! 9m9" like he was trying to take away a child's blankey or something. I'm a little dikey-looking anyway (short hair, glasses, give very few fucks about fashion sense) and mostly get by on being exceedingly cute, so... Oh, no, I meant right at the start. Like, "Oh. Hm.

I've found that being churchy is the best way to start but you have to deploy it early. "Have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart?!" or "I just got back from my third missionary trip to Haiti! It was *so* enlightening!" or something along those lines. No drunk man is going to want to sit there and listen to you blather about Jesus all night and they're not going to want to take you home if they think you're a fundie. They will beat a hasty retreat. I realize that it's not a snappy comeback to the insults but it works.

For the record, I'm an atheist and I dread the day this tactic backfires on me but it hasn't happened yet.  I think trying to get the attention of the bar staff, and getting loud to get the attention of other patrons is good too. Be polite, but firm, and LOUD. 'Don't touch me again, I don't want to talk to you, I don't want to drink with you, give me back my cigarettes &amp;amp; LEAVE ME ALONE.' If you want to get a little nastier you could follow up with 'whatever gave you the impression I had the slightest interest in even talking to you. i wouldn't come back to your place if it was the last safe haven in a nuclear apocalypse.'

Also, second the XKCD takedown someone else mentioned ;)  This is called "negging," these insults are meant to wear down your confidence, so you are more "susceptible" to the guy showing you attention. I would suggest saying something like "Don't neg me" since that shows that you know what his game is. I would also suggest getting the attention of the bartender or some other patron. When you're getting harassed, it's nice to have backup.  I don't understand how this works.  Insulting me like the dude up there did would ABSOLUTELY NEVER get me to do anything but maybe throw my drink in your face.  I can't imagine it's successful outside of douchey male fantasy ("I get to be an asshole *and* get laid?  Sweet!") It works by posing a challenge to the person who was insulted.  The girl doesn't particularly need to have low self-esteem.  Naive girls, girls who are unaware of the "game", and just genuinely nice people's first reaction is to try to show that they are not "dikes" and to explain that it is rude to call people fat, erc.  Others simply feel puzzled and think something like "why is he being rude to me, he doesn't even know me." Then she might want to show that she is actually a nice person.  If he calls her fat, she might be tempted to mention that she is not.  If she calls her "dikey", she might be tempted to show that she is in fact, feminine.  That's all the PUA wants.  Now the door is open for him to prey upon that girl.  This also preys upon women's instinct to please everybody and do not forget the element of surprise here.  Sometimes when youre shocked you lower your guard.  By constantly trying to touch the girl (keno) they are basing themselves on studies that say that human touch makes us trust people more.  Next step is to isolate the girl from other people's influence (someone might know the game and alert the girl) so they fiercely try to get the girl to leave with him.  What happens next borderlines rape: harass, harass, harass til the girl says yes.  That is called "closing", and after that, they go into whatever online community they belong to and write "field reports" about the event. Quite sickening and they know what they're doing.


According to my Criminal Law Professor, there are around 3 million sociopaths (or psychopaths) in the US alone.  Contrary to what most people think, psychopaths are almost never violent, but almost always con artists of all types, PUAs included.  Head over the Seduction community and learn their tricks is what I tell my friends to do and what I do myself.  Beat them at their own game.  The Internet is a beautiful thing.

Head over the Seduction community and learn their tricks is what I tell my friends to do and what I do myself.  Beat them at their own game.  The Internet is a beautiful thing.   Those are all signs of low self esteem, to some degree. People with really strong self esteem respond to insults by thinking "gee, that dude is rude... let's *not* talk to him." If you feel the need to explain yourself, justify yourself, show that you are a nice person, or otherwise interact with someone who was just really rude to you then you're self esteem is at least a little bit too low for this situation. 

Do you know what I'm saying? She doesn't need to have *really* low self esteem, but this approach relies on the assumption that a woman will either have somewhat low self esteem or just not be assertive enough to tell a rude person to back off. Women are socialized not to be rude or assertive...so it works. Yes, I know what you're saying. It works mainly because girls are raised to be nurturing and not to voice their wishes and opinions very loudly, not to be "selfish" and to always be nice.  I guess what I am saying though, is that none of us have max self esteem 100% of the time, so depending on the day, and how the game is played it could virtually work on everyone.  Do you see my point?  My problem with saying that it only works with girls who have low-self esteem is that most of us at some point *are* that girl, even if for a day, and not everyone realizes that.  We can't help the way we were raised, we can only strive to raise the next generations of girls better.  "It works only on girls with low self-esteem", makes us reassure ourselves that it can't possibly happen to us, and by doing that, we become vulnerable.  I also dont like it that it could potentially put the blame on the girl: "Oh, if only she had a higher degree of self-esteem that wouldn't have happened!" I feel that instead of saying that, we, as society should be saying:  "Oh, if only people wouldn't prey upon people." Yes, I know what you're saying.

I can't imagine it's successful outside of douchey male fantasy ("I get to be an asshole *and* get laid?  Sweet!") The basis it comes from is a legitimate flirting techniques.  Let's say you start flirting with someone you like and they pull out their phone, you see it's the newest iphone and jokingly say something like "ohhh looks like we got an apple fanboy here, I had a feeling you were a hipster ;)" (okay so this comment is so like 2008 or something but you get my point).  They might smile and jokingly respond "what do you have an android phone?  I knew we had a geek in our midst"

Playful teasing with slight insults most certainly is a legitimate part of flirting, the difference is that you're doing it to someone is receptive and likes you with small tidbits, not calling a random stranger a fat dyke as a pick-up line, which is just plain old harassment.

The problem with PUA isn't that their "techniques" don't come from legitimate flirting strategies, it's that they skew them into diabolical methods for breaking down the defenses of the most insecure, and then try to say that that's really how all women are.

To me, that iPhone comment/joke just sounds like breaking the ice/making conversation. I do things like that all the time.

But really, it's more about predation than flirting. Unfortunately my circle of friends includes one disgusting little piece of shit (not really *my friend* but a friend of friends) and he's basically sexually harassing me in public (touching me on my back/hip/arm etc despite numerous explicit verbal and written warnings to stop) to try to escalate blah blah blah and it has caused him to even be uninvited to certain social gatherings when I'm there. Mostly, it makes me rage that he takes my 'fuck off' as an invitation. I feel like he's going to rape someone in the near future. I've embarrassed him in front of a group of our friends on one occasion, when he touched me for like the 3rd time in public, by calling him out and telling him to fuck off and making it absolutely clear that he was violating my boundaries by repeatedly touching me against my will. *Poof* went his social proof. Its frustrating that sometimes people try to say that its a legit strategy for those who are so fucked up socially that they have no way to figure dating out otherwise and its just a 'phase'. But my thoughts are that being attracted to that misogynist/degrading culture at all betrays some shitty things about you, once you have a chance to be exposed to the majority of the PUA world.

I can't imagine it's successful outside of douchey male fantasy ("I get to be an asshole *and* get laid?  Sweet!") There is unfortunately some basis for it - people with low self-esteem often respond to these subtle slurs by trying to impress/please these dicks. Looking back to my younger days, this was pretty standard with the creepy older men type (and I hate to say it but my younger self did respond to that bullshit), now it's going all mainstream with places like /r/seduction for the younger crowd.

It's pretty gross. I subscribe to /r/seduction specifically to recognize and avoid the latest trends in PUA whatnot.

Bonus points, he often gets very flustered and suddenly turns into a somewhat likeable human being.  You punched through his jerk shield!  TIL: "PUA" stands for "pickup artist."  TIL: "PUA" stands for "pickup artist."   **Low effort if you run into them rarely**: Just call him on it - something like:

&amp;gt; I know you're trying some sad PUA-type moves, but they're pathetically transparent and really unattractively aggessive to the point of being a bit rapey.

&amp;gt; Just fuck off and leave me alone - I'm not accepting any more drinks from you and this isn't a fun little game we're having.  If you'd come up to me and asked me nicely if you could buy me a drink or chat to me in all likelihood I might have said yes (lie if necessary - the point is to discourage him from trying PUA-type bullshit ever again), but now you've just come off as an obnoxious, rapey asshat all I want to do is get away from you so I can scrub my arm where you've been pawing it all evening.

&amp;gt; Also, you're trying to come off as a confident, alpha male but the mere fact you've obviously been reading books and memorising lame "techniques" in order to score with women marks you out as a *delta* male.  Hell - you might as well get a "lame probably-virgin try-hard" forehead tattoo.

**Higher investment, but infinitely funnier**: Read up on PUA techniques, and narrate them back to him as he tries each one.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Isn't drinking beer kind of dykey? Maybe you should lay off so you don't get any fatter

&amp;gt; Nice [neg](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neg) dude - tell me, does that *ever* work as an opening line?  You just go straight in with a transparent neg you've obviously been practising in the mirror for hours at home, and you completely blew it.

Then every time he touches your arm just shake your head, remove his hand from your arm and say:

&amp;gt; Tsk... *awful* tactile approach, dude.  Seriously - work on some charm before you start pawing women with your sweaty mitts.

Then when the guy "fucking grabs my pack of cigarettes off the bar and holds it over my head and tells me that he's taking my cigarettes hostage and I have to "do something" for him to get them back", try something like:

&amp;gt; Ooooh, a power play!  Ok, how about I knee you in the balls, or call the barman/bouncer/cops and tell them you stole my last pack of cigarettes and watch them toss your ass out on the street?

The point here is to look both unrattled and as familiar with PUA style techniques as you possibly can - he's playing to a game-plan that *only works if people don't know exactly what he's doing*.

I strongly suspect that if you demonstrate even a fleeting familiarity with the gimmicks he's trying to use (and hamfistedly trying to use, at that!) his fake confidence will evaporate and he'll run for the hills.  Don't forget - people are unlikely to resort to PUA techniques if they're already healthy, well-balanced, not lonely and prone to reciprocal relationships or getting laid regularly on their own merits.

The is *especially* true given how bad he obviously was at them - he's obviously still learning, which means he's basically likely to be a scared little boy putting up a brave front, screwing up his courage to try playing a confident, assertive person that's far, far outside his comfort zone.  Someone like that is often wound up so tight that even a little tap can often shatter the bravado and send them packing with their tail between their legs.

Hell, if you take the piss out of PUA techniques and let him know you can spot them a mile off, you might even shake his confidence in them enough that he drops the sleazy asshat approach altogether. i think the arm touching is called "kino" if you really want to speak their language.

and to be honest, the game already "works" if he succeeds in pissing you off, the goal is to get any kind of attention. i think the arm touching is called "kino" if you really want to speak their language.

[deleted] THIS. I'm interested in reading your paper BTW.  THIS. I'm interested in reading your paper BTW.  I would also like to read this paper [deleted] Manipulative sociopaths is the nice way of putting it.  Most of the terms and techniques they're using match up nearly word-for-word with lists of warning signs for emotional abuse. [deleted]   I would suggest mockery and derision. Read up on PUA methods and when someone starts pulling them on you just laugh at them and then make fun of them. While sneering, "Awwwww, look at the creepy dude trying to neg me. What's next big boy, gonna try to touch my arm and mimic my body language?"

After that, if you have no problems with doing so, go home with the least assertive person there just to rub it all in. This. I have no problem completely shaming any man who comes up to me acting like an asshole. You call them out on that shit and call them every name in the book if that's what it takes to get them to go away. They'll think you're a bitch and never come within 5 feet of you again. And never think you need to defend yourself to them -- if they call you a bitch, you say "That's right, I am. Now fuck off."  I'm a little bit younger than you, but I've found that a good, solid "Fuck off" works very well. :)      As always [there's an xkcd for every situation](http://xkcd.com/1027/).

What he was doing is called "negging" (the insult/compliment thing), I have this girls little speech memorised for when this kind of thing happens.

In all seriousness though, 

Step 1. Politely tell him you are waiting for someone and are not intersted in conversation with him or anyone.

Step 2. If he doesn't leave you alone inform the barman that he's bothering you.

Step 3. If dude REALLY can't get a hint, stand up and walk away to a different part of the bar, or "go to the toilet" and sit somewhere else when you come back.

Guys like these are dicks, if you have to interact with them be civil (if you're rude/angry/annoyed they know they're getting to you and consider it a win) and ignore them as much as possible.    The first line out of his mouth would have resulted in my saying, "Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?" and turning my back on him.  This is a type of dude who tests women for low self esteem and submissiveness, I think.  If he gets the reactions he wants, he'll keep pressing until you reluctantly go home with him.  Fuck that.  You don't owe him niceness.  He doesn't own the bar.  You have a right to a nice time in a public place without assholes like him frothing all over you.  Stand up for yourself, *you deserve to be treated like gold.*  Demand it of the people you come in contact with.  

If you really want to do nice though, give him a big, gross, fake smile and say "I'm flattered, but I'm not interested right now, mmkay?"    &amp;gt; "Isn't drinking beer kind of dykey?

Once had a guy on the subway go, "Fucking Dyke!"  after I shoved him off my shoulder.

"Why, thank you!  Someone finally noticed!"  Was my response and smiled.

T'was a great day for me.  Laughter and abject humiliation. Seriously. These are men with low self esteem who are trying (in the worst way) to be more social with women. Laughing at them will ruin their night and get them off your case.  more like they are men looking for women with low self esteem Why not both? Why not both? So, to compensate for their own low self-esteem, they study techniques to talk to girls who also have low self-esteem? I think there's some irony in there somewhere. more like they are men looking for women with low self esteem Men (and women) with high self-esteem don't need to resort to degrading comments to get attention.   &amp;gt;this dude fucking grabs my pack of cigarettes off the bar and holds it over my head and tells me that he's taking my cigarettes hostage and I have to "do something" 

This is the moment I'd hit him the balls. And maybe kick him a little while he's on the ground.

EDIT: Okay I'll include a serious answer. I ward off those guys by mock-screaming and running from him around the bar. Everytime he opens his mouth I just go AAAAAAH and flail away. Repeat until he's too embarrassed to approach you again.     the hell is a PUA ? 'pick up artist' da fuq?


what happened to just saying hi? we're scamming women now? visit /r/seduction for a glimpse                         This is when you get a glass of water from the bartender, and dump it on his head.

Why is it that, if I forget a tampon, and my period comes, I have to secretly ask my fellow surfers-of-the-crimson-tide, sneak the tampon into a restroom, and put it in (or pad)?

Why do males, in particular, get so disgusted by a period? I mean, it's not like explosive toxic waste diarrhea or anything (ew). It's just blood. And why is it so wrong to mention that I have cramps? 

It just seems so stupid, half (or a third, I guess, if you factor out menopausal women? I don't know the stats.) of population experiences monthly menstruation, but if I mention it, things go quiet and awkward, like someone has died. 

Is it like this for anyone else, or no?  [deleted]  Because they don't understand it, and it grosses them out. I mean if you really think about it, it is a little gross. It's a waste product that comes out of your body, kind of like pee or poo. It's congealed blood that was stuck all up in your lady parts that comes oozing out over a period (ha) of a week or so in clots and chunks and squelches around in your underwear in a pad or gets clogged up in a tampon plug.

Most of the guys I know are usually just 'causally' grossed out by periods because, let's be honest, it is a little gross. It's not explosive diarrhea, but it's gross all the same. It's smelly old blood leaking out of your vagina, nobody really wants to talk about it in detail. And with diarrhea, it's the common enemy, right? Men don't understand periods, they can't possibly know the sensation when a particularly disgusting blood clot oozes out or the horrible embarrassment of starting your period early in someone else's bed. But we've all had the runs.

It's a bodily fluid. I don't know any men that are grossed out by an (unused) tampon or pad, that would just be really immature and strange. Also it helps to just have no shame and encourage the ladies around you to do the same. If I need a tampon I ask for a tampon. There's no hushed whisper like it's some big secret that I'm a healthy woman who gets her period. It's not like I'm describing it, I'm just mentioning I need a tampon or I have some cramps if anyone has some Advil.

It was more "embarrassing" in middle school and now it's just a thing that happens and nobody seems to care at all (lots of dude friends stock tampons in their houses anyway) This, mostly, but not entirely. Yes, men, like all people, are grossed out by periods in a completely understandable biological way. No one likes blood, no one likes the waste products like 'pee' or 'poop'. This naturally extends to period waste blood. Of course, men also don't like to think that the things we have sex with also bleed occasionally. If you knew the penis pissed blood and other products every month for a few days, would you still like penises as much? Probably, but you would be more grossed out by it, I'd bet.

However, to contradict a few things in this reply:

Men usually aren't quite as afraid or offended or creeped out by periods as you might think, or we might show. It's social. We, because we are still coming out of an age of sexual and etc, repression, we were taught (not necessarily actively) to react negatively to mention of periods or menstruation. Personally, it's just as creepy to hear about a period as it is to hear about some person peeing. There is a time and a place for it, and sometimes I just won't want to hear it. Overall, though, I don't mind hearing about it if you, and the others around me, can talk about it in a non-taboo way; one that isn't hushed, where I don't get glances like I am some sort of guy who NEEDS to hear about YOUR PERIOD. Act normal and I don't really care if you talk about it. 

Personally, I was raised in a house with 3 boys and some lingering effects of 50's female sexual repression from my parents. I never had female friends until recently. I was never taught what all that stuff was about, so I'm still learning.

If you feel the need to talk about it, talk about it, but don't just bring it up casually like the weather, of course.  &amp;gt;No one likes blood, no one likes the waste products like 'pee' or 'poop'.

ha...never say "no one" especially on the internet

&amp;gt;If you feel the need to talk about it, talk about it, but don't just bring it up casually like the weather, of course

But why not just bring it up casually? There's nothing disgusting about saying "oh man, I don't feel well, I have really bad cramps today" or "does anyone have an extra tampon? I just got my period"

It's not like a girl's just going to go up to you like PERIOD BLOOD IS SPURTING OUT OF ME IN CHUNKS LET ME DESCRIBE IT IN GRAPHIC DETAIL Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't mind someone saying they have bad cramps at all, that's perfectly fine.

Saying "I need an extra tampon, I just got my period" is approximately equivalent to "I think I just peed in my pants, can someone hand me a paper towel so I can walk to the bathroom?". Take that as you will. No, it's not like that at all hahaha. Periods usually don't just explode splooosh into your pants. If you go into a room with women and ask for a tampon it's because you've got your period and there's no shame in that. 

I'm not trying to make you feel badly but guys like you are the reason women are ashamed or embarrassed about perfectly natural bodily functions like their periods. Asking a room with women (and men) in it for a tampon isn't a shameful or embarrassing event (and it's certainly not equivalent to announcing that you just peed in your pants). A tampon is just a normal thing. 

It's more like walking out of the bathroom and into the living room of your friend's home and saying: "the ladies room is out of toilet paper, do you have any more?"

It's just a bathroom product and there's no need to make it 'disgusting' Well, I do agree with you that there is no reason to make it disgusting, but I disagree with you on the level of 'bad' in announcing a period/peeing. 

I appreciate your ability to not sound like an attacking ass like some probably would when telling me I am wrong (there's no way to make that not sound passive aggressive, bur earnest, is there?). But I like to think I am not part of the reason periods are stigmatized poorly. I believe that if someone were to mention it, or ask for help from me, I could respond appropriately and without embarrassment, but as far as my own personal experience goes, women (and men, but only indirectly, of course) have never been able to address that subject in anything but an ashamed or quiet tone. I believe that it's possible that more men are open to women being more open that they are, but women don't realize it. And of course there ARE plenty of men who are very stigmatizing and treat this subject poorly. But there is a negative feedback loop in that no one can address it confidently because they will be judged. Not because the thing itself is bad, but because people are *supposed* to feel bad about that. I disagree, but it does exist. You just said:

&amp;gt;don't just bring it up casually like the weather, of course.

and 

&amp;gt;Saying "I need an extra tampon, I just got my period" is approximately equivalent to "I think I just peed in my pants, can someone hand me a paper towel so I can walk to the bathroom?".

and

&amp;gt;But there is a negative feedback loop in that no one can address it confidently because they will be judged.

Yeah, by guys with the attitude that you have. It's not like saying "i peed in my pants' because pee is something you can control. If you get your period you get your period. It is normal every day bathroom body talk. I would agree this is inappropriate at, say, the dinner table. But hanging out with some friends? 

"Oh man, does anyone have an extra tampon?" is not disgusting or embarrassing or anything. It just IS. 

Also, from a woman, being cool about periods and acting like it aint no thang will score you MAJOR points with the ladies. Men who are scared of periods and weirded out by them and act like it's gross are seen as immature and it's an unattractive trait to have. When I get all crampy and bleedy and unhappy AND I need a tampon the last thing I need is some guy in the room acting like it's gross or out of line that I (god forbid) said it out loud that I had my period. 

It's not gross. If you treat it like it's not gross (and hey, maybe sometime you can buy tampons for your girlfriend!) it will get you major maturity points. (plus period sex is a great excuse for shower sex and sometimes you get to pretend your dick is a weapon) It's women too. As I have said, in my experience, women won't usually (read: never, in my experience) speak of it (at least in the presence of men), because, at least partially, they fear/know/think that men will have an adverse reaction. 

I am talking about peeing accidentally (outside of your control, for example if you are laughing uncontrollably, or are at a long presentation or a movie or something). 

I have never had the chance to earn these "Major points". I apparently can't stress to you enough that I am not as grossed out by periods as you think I am.   The human body does some pretty non-beautiful things. I don't like hearing about people gushing blood from their vaginas, because, as a woman, I know how gross it can be. I also don't like hearing anyone talk about phlegm, bowel movements, or urine. Those things are all important, I suppose, but they are not appealing. Yeah it'd be like someone at work saying "ugh I really need to take a dump." I'm pretty sure things would get pretty quiet with that line, too. You're expected to maintain a professional attitude with coworkers and that means only divulging as much personal info as is deemed appropriate. Some coworkers are closer than others but everyone has a line of appropriateness. ha! people at my work are super comfortable around each other and we tell each other when nature calls. Oh god mine too. But it is a biomedical lab, so the environment is a bit... Different. The human body does some pretty non-beautiful things. I don't like hearing about people gushing blood from their vaginas, because, as a woman, I know how gross it can be. I also don't like hearing anyone talk about phlegm, bowel movements, or urine. Those things are all important, I suppose, but they are not appealing.   Because it's private.  It involves body parts that are not normally discussed in polite company, and it involves disgusting substances coming out of those private body parts.  Do you talk to your boss or your friends about that wonderful, satisfying shit you took this morning in graphic detail?  Or about the oozing, infected cut on your toe?  Or about the cyst that had to be lanced by a doctor and squirted pus all over the place?  There's nothing shameful in defecation or in an infected wound, and we all defecate - but we just don't talk about it in public.      Cultural trend passed down from forever ago. If you read the Bible, you'll see that periods make women unclean and anything she sits on unclean. That carries over to other religions and then proceeded to influence everything else.       Well. Do you find semen gross? 

I think men find periods embarrassing/disgusting because they haven't seen blood coming out of their privates every month for their entire teenage/adult lives. We have. 

I mean.. can you think back on the first time you got your period? Did it not just FREAK YOU THE SHIT OUT? 

So just imagine--that is what a man goes through every time a female aquaintance/wife/girlfriend relates her period experience.  Well. Do you find semen gross?

I assume, but have no idea if true, that this isn't the case everywhere. Are their cultures out there where menstruation isn't treated like some big taboo mystery? Imagine your lovebird sends you off on a mission to buy a product that you know little to nothing about, and there exists almost an entire aisle of choices. 99% of those choices are the wrong ones, and you dreadfully imagine the possibility of coming home to a hormonal, upset, and bloody significant other if you pick the wrong one. Even if you're told which one to buy, what if you weren't given enough information? Where exactly is that product in this huge aisle anyway? Am I sure this is the one I was told to get? What if it was discontinued last week and I have to find some alternative? Can I ask one of the ladies in this aisle for help or will they take it weirdly? It's a lot of pressure!

I imagine if you go to the store with your hubby and show him the product you buy, and where it's located, he might feel less nervous about buying it without you there to help next time. But most people don't do that, so men feel unprepared to buy feminine products for their ladies.

But most people don't do that, so men feel unprepared to buy feminine products for their ladies.  Because it's polite not to discuss your excrements with people. It's not like you'd shout across the office YO CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME SOME TOILET PAPER I GOTTA POOP. It's just personal business. Menstrual blood is not excrement, and I hear LOTS of people talk about their poop. Not to mention farts.  Sorry, FAIL.      Misogyny.

No, really. It's not weird to ask someone without a cold for a tissue. Periods shouldn't be a big deal. But they are, because girls are gross. And the grosser and more hushed up we are, the less trouble we'll cause.

Edit: [Read this](http://changewhatswithin.tumblr.com/post/42567891488/when-you-grow-up-as-a-girl-the-world-tells-you) I dunno, most people aren't open about pooping or peeing or coughing up phlegm even though those are natural things. I personally, as a female, find my own periods to be pretty gross.

I'm embarrassed to take out my tampons in public because they show that I'm bleeding from my vagina, just like I'm embarrassed to take out Gas-X in public because it shows that I'm gassy lol. Both are natural and nothing to be ashamed of, but I think it's fine to be discreet about bodily functions.  I don't talk about what I do in the bathroom in public, including bleeding from my vagina. Not because I'm misogynistic, I just think what's in the bathroom should stay in the bathroom. 

Now, if it was the entire reproductive cycle it would be entirely different. But periods themselves aren't something that I would be open to talking about/being public about.  The problem is those functions are more or less predictable, whereas getting a period is hard to predict for women, especially young women. There's a difference between acknowledging thing and going into details. If you're on a long trip, nobody looks at you wierd for asking for a pit stop. Asking for a tampon shouldn't be different.  </snippet></document><document><title>I would like to get 2X's thoughts on this - Gender Imbalance in China: the 'leftover men' who can't find wives. </title><url>http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/chinas-new-bachelor-class/273040/</url><snippet>  I think it's part of the cultural mentality. Certainly many women will date and marry for money, it's a little different in a country like the US where women aren't considered second rate.

I mean, families for generations have been giving up their baby girls in favor of having boys, and the families that do keep those baby girls instill an importance of marrying for success.  Yeah, it's a sad situation all around. So many women have had the importance of 'marrying up' and having someone to take care of them deeply instilled, and now it's backfiring upon the millions of men who can't afford a wife.   I think what's most interesting about this is that marriage and the issue of 'leftovers' is not actually a gender issue, but a socioeconomic one. 'Leftover men' can't find wives because they are too poor (and dare I say, chauvanistic, depending on how traditional their upbringing was) and the '*shengnu*' don't want to marry because they are educated and want more from their lives than the traditional role of the wife who takes care of her husband. It's probably very symptomatic of the growing divide between the upper and lower classes, not to mention the swelling middle class. When you have a large middle class aspiring to social mobility, you end up with a very Jane Austen-esque society whereby the women want to marry up (or, like Jane Austen herself, not marry at all). It's definitely a cultural gender issue. There are more men than women in China because people want sons, not daughters. There's sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, and foreign adoptions of girls. The end result is that their sons suffer in adulthood from the imbalanced ratio. Yes.... I'm not disputing that the one child policy completely threw the *number* of males vs females off balance. But this in itself wouldn't explain the fact that the single men are largely poor farmers. In theory, if you took socioeconomics out of the equation, there would be an equal number of single men across all demographics being unable to find wives, right? But throw an enormous and rapidly growing middle class, and you have a population of women who don't want to marry 'beneath' them, don't even want to marry people from the same 'class'... their opportunity for upward mobility is strong and, now more than ever before, very much within their grasp.


I think what is particularly fascinating about China right now is that traditionally, a single woman is pretty much as low as you can get in terms of social status. Yet there are a growing number of educated women in the cities who are choosing to not marry at all. It's not that they can't find husbands, it's that they don't want to marry. This is new to China and I think it's very interesting, although I'm not sure what it means long term for the country. I think what's most interesting about this is that marriage and the issue of 'leftovers' is not actually a gender issue, but a socioeconomic one. 'Leftover men' can't find wives because they are too poor (and dare I say, chauvanistic, depending on how traditional their upbringing was) and the '*shengnu*' don't want to marry because they are educated and want more from their lives than the traditional role of the wife who takes care of her husband.

When you have a large middle class aspiring to social mobility, you end up with a very Jane Austen-esque society whereby the women want to marry up (or, like Jane Austen herself, not marry at all).    Pretty concerned about a war.  With this many young men without partners, there is either going to be a huge wave of immigration into other countries, or there is going to be a military conflict.  Historically, a significant excess of young men has lead to conflict.  But then, I'm fairly paranoid.  In a couple of years, once a large bulk of these men hit puberty, you can safely invest in a company that manufactures fleshlights.   </snippet></document><document><title>A new study has shown that objectification can make college-aged women more accepting of the status quo and less likely to engage in social activism, potentially contributing to gender inequality.</title><url>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/11/objectification-suppresses-womens-desire-to-engage-in-social-activism-study-finds/</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Slut Shaming vs Virgin Shaming - what are your experiences?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cg0r/slut_shaming_vs_virgin_shaming_what_are_your/</url><snippet>I hear about slut shaming a lot, which is understandable considering we are all free to do what we want with out bodies, and rightly should be free of judgement.

But today I'd like to talk about virgin shaming. It's become apparent to me that we aren't exactly looking at all sides here. And I think there may be quite a few women who choose to wait who take a lot of flak too.
Thoughts, ladies?  23 year old virgin here

Sometimes virgins are treated as though they don't understand the world the same way as "more experienced" peers. People specifically avoid talking about certain things in front of me after finding out I'm a virgin. That, or they simply refuse to believe that I could be a virgin. Those are the main issues I've seen in my life. 

 oh my god I get this crap all the time. I am 25 and my friends still treat me like I am naive and silly when it comes to relationships because I've never had sex. 

I have been told I don't know what I am attracted to because I've never had sex. Wut. Sex or not, I know when I'm attracted to someone. So frustrating &amp;gt;:[ 23 year old virgin here

   Oh God... I was treated like crap for wanting to wait for marriage. The guy I was waiting for, well, he said the engagement was off if I didn't get "dtf" fast. So, well, I did and then guess who got divorced two and a half years later? :/

On the plus side, my husband now is freaking awesome and was really happy I'm inexperienced in that regard. He shouldn't have pressured you. He should have just broken up with you. Obviously you guys weren't sexually compatible, but he totally went about it the wrong way.  Actually, I shoulda kicked him to the curb rather than keeping him around.

I do love that you added how your husband now was happy about the inexperience, though. I'd hope more men find that attractive (or endearing) than society likes to tell us.  As a person who talks about sex/masturbation/porn a lot, people often throw around slut/whore/etc, think I'm easy or have low morals.

When they find out I've never had a dick inside me, they do a complete reversal and act like I'm a 3 year old when anything sexual comes up and treats me like I'm a little, incompetent girl.

I prefer whore/slut to "oh you're so cute trying to be a big girl". Sex is a lot more then having a dick inside of you.  If that were the case then none of the sex I've had with women would even count as real sex.  Hell even with men piv sex is only a small aspect of my sexuality.

I prefer whore/slut to "oh you're so cute trying to be a big girl". [deleted] Why would that be rare? Virgins masturbate and watch porn and read erotica and are sexual people just like everyone else. [deleted] Yes, two reasons. Firstly, pregnancy is always a risk, and I'm not at a place in my life where I'm willing to risk it.

Second, I was abused as a child and have blocked most of my memories off. However, random things can trigger flashbacks and panic attacks. It can be as simple as a light grip on my arm and then I'm five years old with my stepdaddy on top of me. Luckily, that man has gone out of my life and I have found peace with myself and my circumstances. It's mostly a cautionary measure.  Have you sought therapy for the abuse?  I was a virgin until I was 19, and I hadn't even been kissed by a boy until I was 18. However, I didn't see the point in waiting to have sex with someone I was in love with--sex seemed like an added bonus to a relationship, but was nice in and of itself. So I had no qualms about losing my virginity to someone who was my ideal type (tall, thin, cute, smart, etc.) after only knowing him a couple of days. Even though there was some emotional fallout because I actually wanted to date this man (and I was just a rebound fling for him), I don't regret my decision. 

Even though I lost my virginity later than a lot of other people, I was still shamed for losing my virginity outside of a relationship and having my first couple of sexual experiences (just oral with one less desirable fellow, and then my full-out PiV experience with the man I was drawn to) outside of a long-term relationship. I've only slept with two men, and kissed three. I've been on three first dates. Yet I've had friends jokingly (and sometimes not-so-jokingly) refer to me as a huge slut who'll give it out to anyone. Just because I, personally, don't really see the point in waiting months and months to have sex or saying no to safe casual sex.  Oh god, if kissing three guys and having sex with two is already considered being a huge slut, I am screwed. Oh wait, nevermind, I actually don't care. :)  Haha, my "sluttiness" is mostly about going to bed with them so quickly. I fooled around with one at a party, had sex with another two days after knowing him (and *before* our first date), and I slept with my boyfriend relatively early on (for them...it was like a week after our first date). It's the whole "giving it away for free" aspect that they take issue with. Personally, I don't care.  Haha, my "sluttiness" is mostly about going to bed with them so quickly.

It's the whole "giving it away for free" aspect that they take issue with. Personally, I don't care.   There was a lot of pressure on me to lose my virginity that started when I was in my early teens. A prominent girl in my social group had sex for the first time when we were twelve, and was instantly the coolest girl in our small school. I didn't have sex, or engage in any sexual activity beyond kissing until I was 22, simply because I was waiting for the right man. But all through middle and high school everyone was in a hurry to have sex, and if you weren't having sex it was because you were unattractive, smelly, and a bitch. Fuck, highschool was stupid. Anyways, I eventually ended up lying about it, saying I was having sex with older guys no one else new, when in fact I was still nervous because I didn't start having a real period until I was seventeen. Of course, I was then subjected to rumors about what a secret slut I undoubtedly was, but that was much more bearable than having everyone assume my vagina smelled so bad that no one would go near it. I'm glad I waited to have sex with the man I'm still currently having sex with though, it's meant that %100 of my sexual experiences have been positive and enjoyable, which I think is not the case for most people who have sex in their early teens.   I've been on both ends of the spectrum - even though I'm not sexually active. It's more about the implications about what kind of 'character' the people shaming you want to represent you as - they don't even really care if you've had sex or not, unless it's to 'confirm' their claims. People will go out of their way to police you regardless. The best thing I did was stop giving a damn. That being said, I got called frigid and pretentious for not being 'easy', and then when people knew I was interested elsewhere, I became a 'slut' and a 'whore' overnight who had no respect for herself. First they tell you to loosen up, then they tell you to close your legs! Seriously...   I had an issue in the past with a friend who would basically reject my opinions on things because I'm a virgin. He would just tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about and it will all change after I have sex.

It really pissed me off because I don't have to have a penis stuck inside me for my brain to work. I can learn from the world around me, and I can form opinions about things.

We weren't even talking about sex. We could be having a conversation about work standards and employee treatment in the US vs another country and it would always come down to me not knowing what I'm talking about because I'm a virgin. 

Really ticked me off, however we seem to be past that now.      I was in a relationship for nearly four years before we had sex. Everyone, including my close friends assumed we had had sex. When they found out they were incredulous and completely changed their mind about what they thought of me. Topics that were comfortable before suddenly became off topic and even my *best friend* was virgin shaming me. She had recently gotten into a new relationship and would treat me like I was 10 and didn't know anything and that I was naieve. Apparently not having PiV sex means that I am an inexperienced prude. It still hurts just thinking about it now. I don't think people realize that women are shamed ***either way***. Whether you have sex or not everyone is going to be judging you.    Honestly, I really haven't experienced any shaming, personally. I had sex at 13, but I never sensed that it was something people were doing. I had just known about it and it was something I was interested in. I'm also pretty proud of my sexuality, so attempting to shame me wouldn't really work out.        I don't really care what ladies do in their bedrooms and I don't think I know anyone that actually does, either. The only time I hear women being "virgin shamed" is when they proclaim they are still virgins like it is some virtuous trait that they've saved. Like it somehow makes them more worthwhile because they are more "selective".

I don't like when anyone brags. I couldn't care less if you've had sex with half the world or if you're waiting until you're 99 years old. I just don't want to hear about it and I definitely don't want to be judged for having a different sexual life.

I have friends who've lost count at 100+ and friends that are still virgins. Nobody cares, honestly. Maybe it's just college or the people I hang out with are especially liberal or something but honestly nobody gives a shit. 

The only 'proud virgins' I've encountered were extremely haughty and judgmental (and religious, go figure) and I could maybe see them being 'virgin shamed' if for nothing else than their 'holier than thou' attitude. Regular old virgins? 

Honestly, no one cares. Maybe it's just because I'm in high school, but this is NOT my experience... High school is another ball game entirely. It's so so so different in college GOOD. I'm sick of being the stuck-up prude. Honestly nobody cares as long as you are open and not judgmental of others for what they do or don't do as well. Casual sex is big in college but I have virgin friends and nobody makes fun of them or anything. But I go to a huge liberal arts school and none of my friends are religious or anything. Some just aren't into sex and they don't make a big deal about it, they're just not into doing it (or they just haven't yet) 

as long as you're just prude (lol) and not actually stuck up I can't see why anyone would put you down for it. To each their own, if you don't judge me i won't judge you kind of thing idk what college you go to but I just mentioned in passing that I was a virgin and my friends perspective of me changed drastically. They stopped talking about certain topics with me and would talk down to me like I was 10 and an ignorant, naieve child</snippet></document><document><title>Update: How can I be a better mentor to an 11 year old who is very vocal about my lack-of-coolness?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18buru/update_how_can_i_be_a_better_mentor_to_an_11_year/</url><snippet>[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17w4wp/how_can_i_be_a_better_mentor_to_an_11_year_old/)

So I got a lot of really great comments here on how to deal with this situation. I&#8217;ve contacted my match support specialist to help me out with this. I&#8217;ve been extremely stressed out trying to figure out how to deal with this, despite all the suggestions.  

To be nice, I messaged her on FB about her snow day. I got basically all one-word answers. I mentioned how one time I tried snowboarding and she told me &#8220;So do I care?&#8221; and for clarification I asked &#8220;Are you saying you don&#8217;t care?&#8221; and she says &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I said&#8221; and so I asked her why she said it and if it was to make me feel bad.  As you can see, I employed one of the methods mentioned on original post.  She read my message, started typing and then signed off without leaving a response.   I thought that maybe she got the message that she wasn&#8217;t going to be mean anymore, realizing what she said could make me feel bad.  I wrote a status on my FB (not directed at her, or anyone) about today being a good day for sugar on snow and she responds &#8220;No&#8221;. 

She clearly has a negative attitude towards me, and all of my pent up annoyance at the hair and clothing critiques had been building up until today when I was supposed to see her, and I cancelled because there&#8217;s lots of snow falling now and I have to walk to go see her.  The makeup date is Friday.  My support specialist just called and said she&#8217;s going to speak with the little and the social worker.  They would&#8217;ve never expected her to act this way, as she&#8217;s not known to be a bully, but she does get bullied.  She's the insecure little girl, and I'm the insecure big girl. Her last match wasn&#8217;t Ms. Cool either, she was an older woman, but since she knew her for a long time, she may have been less judgmental.  

The match support specialist gave me the option of closing the match right then and there over the phone today, but I thought back to this remembering all the advice people had shared and decided not to.  I want to wait it out to see if there&#8217;s some underlying thing going on.  I know I asked how to be a better mentor to her, but I just don&#8217;t know if I can be taken seriously or stick with it, but it's going to be her or no one at all (ie not going to take a different replacement Little, doesn't seem right).  I just feel very overwhelmed by what was supposed to be a fun volunteer job.  I am also dealing with the underlying hurt of feeling the exact same way as I did when people made fun of me in 5th grade.  I&#8217;m really able to see the vulnerable side of my little, and the same goes for me.   I think dealing with my fifth grade experience through this is not allowing me to empathize.  

I have mixed feelings as to the girl she actually is.  She isn&#8217;t making fun of me all the time of course, but I feel she generally dislikes me like she hates all of her teachers.  What if I&#8217;m just overreacting?  What if she didn&#8217;t realize she was being mean?  What if she thinks I&#8217;m honestly so bad I could use her fifth grade advice and tells me because she's so comfortable with me?  The comments about my clothes at first didn&#8217;t even bother me, maybe she noticed since I tried to laugh them off and not make a big deal of it.  The comment "Do I care?" makes me think she doesn't like me at all.  This is her last chance at having a match since they don't do site based in middle school and she can&#8217;t do a community based match.  Is three months even enough time? I really hope I&#8217;m not being unfair.  I&#8217;m not enjoying this at all.  I get so nervous thinking about even saying something to her about it even though I received great advice.  I feel very unhappy and just wish I had the confidence to deal with it.  I am feeling very uncomfortable about the whole situation.  How much of this is the actual match and even if I do overcome it, will I make a difference before the school year is over?

TL;DR I need a pep talk.  Haven&#8217;t seen Little since original posting, but more rude interaction over FB. Match Support is surprised at how she is treating me.  Social worker at the school will talk with the BBBS rep and Little to determine what&#8217;s up.  Know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into if you become a Big Sis.
  I'm a children's educator.

I'm usually sarcastic back at them. I don't insult them, but whenever they make a scathing remark, I say something like "well aren't you a smart one". Or when I ask them something, and I see one of them is about to make an obvious pun, I just say over them "NO SMART ASSING".

Basically treat them like a real big sister would. Support her, but don't treat her like some porcelain doll. When she's sassing you, sass her back... but when you make jokes, make jokes about her attitude and remarks and not about her specifically.

For her, "coolness" is about not caring and being aloof. If you speak with her in a playful tone, and don't get all serious at her mocking, she won't see you as the "uncool" teacher, and maybe she'll be friends with you.

Once she gets close to you, you can help her realise that you can care and be passionate about something without being "uncool" (it's okay to care and have feelings). Talk to her, not at her. Don't give her lectures, and try to help her through mutual conversation.

(As for being uncool: The secret of coolness of adults is basically realising that not everyone will like you, and that it's okay. Then you stop worrying so much about how you're perceived.)

EDIT: I made grammar derps. This totally works. My students were insulting and mean unless I stood up to their bullying. And yes, this little girl is bullying you. She is trying to do to you what has been done to her. She wants desperately to be in a position of power so she can't get hurt.

It is important to note (as stareattheart said) that being sarcastic/sassy right back at the kid doesn't involve saying the same kinds of hurtful things being said to you. It's showing that you aren't visibly bothered via acknowledgment and mockery of the intended insult. I'm a children's educator.

EDIT: I made grammar derps. What concerns me is that she won't try at school because she doesn't want to be a nerd. I still haven't really grasped coolness at the middle school level.  I'm always super enthusiastic and passionate about everything, always been that way. I can think of a lot of people and say the one thing they're good at, and Little asked me what I'm "really good at" ... I told her I'm really good at more than one thing.  Honestly, it would probably be statistics or business sense but how does that translate to an 11 year old? More generally I would say my strength is learning/perseverance.  I used to be a theater geek, so maybe acting too.  The coolest people I know are the ones that have a positive attitude.  I hope I can teach her something between now and June... that is if she even wants to be matched with me after match support/school social worker talks to her!  Thanks for the update!You said something interesting - that she reminds you of when you were her age, and being bullied. Maybe this could be the key - asking her about how she feels when people say mean things to her about how she's not cool. Then ask her how she thinks YOU feel when she says mean things to you about how you're not cool. Perhaps getting her to notice that her behaviour is the same as the behaviour of her bullies will help, at least with the meanness.I'd suggest doing it face to face, so she HAS to listen to you. Thank you for responding. Until today and speaking with match support, I had no idea she was dealing with bullying problems, and she insisted to me that she was a bully and got detention all the time when I had asked her if she'd say mean things to her classmates.  It is definitely a new angle to work, for sure.  This may very well be unsalvageable; I get the vibe that she doesn't like you, and that she makes you nervous and sets off all sorts of bad feelings, and that neither of you is really getting anything positive out of the relationship.  This is not a reflection on you, or a reflection on her - sometimes people just don't fit together very well.  Adults or kids.

What strikes me is that you're allowing her to have a lot of power over you.  As an adult, and a mentor, you need to have the power balance tilt in your direction, not in hers.  Do not talk to her about your feelings - "When you do this, it makes me feel sad".  You're an adult, and you need to establish adult authority.  Don't make her feel like she can hurt you.  Talk about her feelings, not yours.

I used to work with kids - I had a tutoring practice, and my interactions with my students were one-on-one and kinda like what you have with this girl.  When I was with a kid, I took them seriously and interacted with them the way I would with an adult - but I also did not make myself vulnerable to them.  It wasn't an equal interaction.  I was an adult, and I had adult authority over them; and I was a nice adult because despite that adult authority, I chose to take them seriously and treat them with respect.  That sort of thing.  My middle-school students always thought I was terribly cool.  

Here's one thing that you could do to try to salvage things.  Talk to the girl.  Ask her honestly what SHE wants to happen.  Explain to her that you are thinking of withdrawing from the program, and that this is her last chance of having a match, and ask her if she just doesn't want to do the BBBS thing anymore.  Maybe she doesn't.  Maybe some well-meaning adult pressured her into signing up, and she views it as yet another adult forcing her to do things she doesn't want to do.  Maybe she just really honestly doesn't like you.  You need to talk to her to find out.  She's a human being and she's allowed to have opinions and preferences.  You can't "make a difference" in her life without her consent.
  I'm not sure if it helps to employ a teacher perspective here...

From the basic info I'm getting from you, I would say she does crave attention but the focus on being "cool" has made her prefer negative attention, perhaps she feels the reaction is more general. 

When we have kids who are "mean", it's generally because they want attention, because they are covering up their insecurities, or they don't trust people to care about them so they would rather be the one to make you not care. 

I realize this is incredinly generalized, because there are tons of details that constitute every individual child's reaction... all the same, I recommend making sure you make your boundaries absolutely crystal clear.

This mostly involves a full circle process. You start on the positive, without showing hesitation or fear of her reaction. When (if) she brings it to the negative behaviour you are struggling with, you confront it and tell her it is unacceptable. Your "sanction" in this case, is that she can choose one of two options: to work with you as your little sister, which you would prefer because you genuinely like her, or that you can call back and tell them she has shown you through her disrespectful actions that she would prefer you were not her big sister.

Kids like to have a choice. She will most likely huff or puff a little. Give it a  moment, let her know you're going to get a glass of water or do something else for a moment, and when you come back she needs to have made a decision. I'd go on a limb and say she will choose to apologize, but if she chooses that she would prefer you weren't her big sister- there is no reason for you to force a relationship which doesn't work. 

Try not to show your hurt if this is the case, rather calmly tell her that is fine and you will make sure it gets sorted. 

Assuming she chooses to work on it, then you will have the platform you need to bring it full circle and back to positive constructive conversation, let her talk about how she feels and why she would rather say mean things to someone who wants to help her. 

tl;dr - Act normal, confront behaviour, give choice withdraw, full circle. This is a new approach.  I feel like it is going to be very awkward to see her after she meets with the match support person and the social worker. She does have to understand that I am strongly considering calling off the match... it's basically under the impression that she doesn't like me.  The first time I met her I really was so happy and thought she seemed so well adjusted and nice that I had really lucked out.  Every meeting since then, however, I've had to deal with attitude.  She'll open up at first for the first 45 minutes just normal conversation about schoolwork, movies, food, and then all of a sudden she'll start asking about where I shop and making her comments. I know this is probably emotionally rough for you as a person as well, especially as I read your other post where you mentioned you were an only child and haven't worked with kids much. Let me just reassure you it's not about you. 

I hope it all goes well, or if not that you don't feel it is a personal issue. 

Best of luck!   I don't want to sound mean... But if you need an adult to step in with your 11 year old student and your feelings are hurt, maybe you aren't the best person to be her mentor?  There are tons of other ways to be active in the community/give back and many of us aren't suited to mentor children.  

Just a thought.   Ugh, sorry I didn't see the earlier post. Reading this made me want to throw up remembering my ascerbic 11 year old self. My teachers told e how bad my attitude was, but I was so miserable I was incapable of doing anything about it, unable to see that I had an effect on anyone or that they could care less how I behaved.

Please don't give up on this girl just yet. Tell her that it's obvious she doesn't like you, and ask her if she'd rather try someone else...tell her a good match is important and that you want the best for her. Please don't just abandon her; although she should be made to feel responsible for saying hurtful things, she may be testing you because, in her eyes, other adults have let her down.   &amp;gt;and so I asked her why she said it and if it was to make me feel bad. As you can see, I employed one of the methods mentioned on original post. She read my message, started typing and then signed off without leaving a response

hmm bad move. she obviously wants to feel like she knows what's up. that she's privy to what's REALLY going on. like the cool kids. (who are apparently bullying her). and you're deconstructing her to her face

I've never done the BBBS thing but I can speculate that what she'd like to get out of it (if she wants to get ANYTHING out of it) is status gains - you've got to be prestigious to be around. introducing her to what's about to become popular, before it becomes popular, and taking charge in what you do together. I bet what she would really like is if you could take her to a club, (obviously not feasible) but what a story she'd have to tell back at school. if you want to carry on with this you need to figure out how you can give her something she can show-off later to her friends, and I don't mean physical things, but insider knowledge and stories. maybe take her to a fashion show
 Sometimes, it's not even that.  What kids that age desperately crave is coolness, you're right - but just about anything can be "cool" to them if you're an adult and you're doing it and you're confident about it.  It's all about confidence.

When I was a math tutor, I convinced my students that it was "cool" to be good at mental math.  Arithmetic is about as uncool as it gets, right?  Well, apparently when a "cool" adult does it, it gets pretty damn cool to a 12-year-old.  You don't want to be part of their world - you want to introduce them to your world.  If you're cool, that world becomes cool by extension.  

Kids that age are looking for role models - adults who are not their parents whom they can emulate.  The role model doesn't have to be an 11-year-old's idea of what "cool" is.  The role model should be extending the 11-year-old's concept of "cool".  

An adult mentor can do all sorts of things for an 11-year-old that the kid would consider terribly cool and transgressive that, to an adult, is nothing.  I like the idea of a fashion show or a club (maybe there's a club-like place where they allow kids?).  Take her to a concert.  Take the kid to a fun coffeeshop and let her have just a little sip of coffee.  Depending on what sorts of rules her parents have for her, stretching them just a little bit can feel terribly transgressive - and really cool.

Think of a cool aunt or someone else you looked up to as a kid.  Chances are they weren't going crazy researching middle-school fashion trends.  They were living interesting adult lives and occasionally let the kid experience just a little bit of that.   &amp;gt;and so I asked her why she said it and if it was to make me feel bad. As you can see, I employed one of the methods mentioned on original post. She read my message, started typing and then signed off without leaving a response

 Thank you for the reply.  I'm not sure how to deal with the whole facebook thing, they say it's a good idea to be in contact outside the weekly match, but maybe FB isn't the best thing. I agree about the status thing, she says her friend who has a big sister gets to go to the spa, and when she had her big sister before they made pizza and then were going to go to the movies but couldn't because the Big was too busy.  How cool would it be to go to the movies with someone older than you?  Maybe you could even get into a PG 13!  But in all seriousness, we have to stay inside the school and still somehow introduce her to this coolness that she seeks.  Just one voice in favor of ditching the FB connection: I work with middle schoolers, but don't friend anyone on Facebook who's under age 13 ... they're there illegally, which sends pretty mixed messages if I'm okay with that.       Also...since she's into dance and Beyonce...some of this top 40 crap is directly aimed at girls her age...and she likely has no other alternative. Would it be possible to bring her to an all-ages open mic at a coffee shop and show her there is a world beyond stripper-platform shoes, bling and autotune? Perhaps you could encourage her to song a piece...you don't play guitar, do you?</snippet></document><document><title>In light of William Shatner's post</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cwqe/in_light_of_william_shatners_post/</url><snippet>So, I think by now we've all heard about William Shatner criticizing Reddit for being bigoted and misogynistic in many ways.  And I do feel like a previously good community has been ruined by what appears to be a group of 12-year-old boys.

The Shatner thing has sparked a whole debate as to what constitutes censorship, but I think we can make a difference.  Yes, I hate seeing all these misogynistic posts and this new sex advice woman on reddit.  My suggestion is that we just straight up respond en masse to the idiots out there.  We let them know their comments are not acceptable.  Of course, we won't win them all, but the only way to take this back is with an onslaught of individual actions.

We can't complain that reddit is a bunch of teenage boys and then be afraid to take them on.  I think that if we are courageous enough to post, there will be enough reasonable men to agree and upvote us.

Reddit is based on voicing many opinions, so let's make ourselves heard instead of running away from what's uncomfortable.  Let's take what's ours.

Thoughts?   &amp;gt;. My suggestion is that we just straight up respond en masse to the idiots out there.  
  
That's what /r/ShitRedditSays is for. B-b-but I thought SRS is full of evil nazis! That's what the rest of reddit tells me, at least! D: &amp;gt;. My suggestion is that we just straight up respond en masse to the idiots out there.  
  
That's what /r/ShitRedditSays is for.  I applaud Mr. Shatner for highlighting reddit for its bigotry, but I'm conflicted: he doesn't exactly have a spotless record when it comes to misogyny in particular... he's made some pretty sexist comments in the past. [Example here](http://thezombieheadquarters.blogspot.ca/2011/08/fall-of-kate-mulgrew-or-william-shatner.html).

I think that Shatner should have (and should still) acknowledge his own past history, apologize for it, and then encourage reddit to do the same. Be a role model.   Really you've got to pick your battles. Most of the idiots on here are just trolls trying to get a rise out of someone. And when it isn't a troll there are usually people replying and trying to set things straight but a lot of times the best thing to do is just downvote and move on.</snippet></document><document><title>You and me have the same insecurity.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cs67/you_and_me_have_the_same_insecurity/</url><snippet>Some girls get bullied because they have little boobs.

Bullying is hell. I was bullied for almost the entire time I was in grade and high school. Eleven years. It carried over through four schools. It wracked my mind - had to be the main reason I had no self-esteem, no self-confidence, depression and anxiety attacked me for basically all my life. I'm finally at a point where they're in remission, because when you've had them for 25 years, they'll never go away completely, they've already guided the development of my life so totally. 

My crime, apparently, was that I just wanted to be like the other girls. I liked to play with them, I was even great at mimicking their voices - like spot-on perfect matches for some of them.. 

When you're trans.. and the word and the idea for it doesn't compute.. you become a target. And you become ostracized and the outsider. I'm probably going to be the outsider forever. I've always wanted to be part of *something*.. but every place I'm part of, is itself some kind of outsider group. And it hurts so desperately when all you want is to be accepted and loved T.T just like everyone else does.     As a completely middle-of-the-road average girl I still can't work out why I was bullied for 5 years. I wasn't bookish, I wasn't teacher's pet, no-one mentioned my boobs or lack thereof, my weight or my height. I don't give a rats ass now but you can be bullied just for being you - and I think if I'd known *why* I was the target it could have been easier. </snippet></document><document><title>Let's create /r/TwoXMusic!

   &amp;gt; What kind of music do you think is underrepresented on reddit?

Ragtime.  I'll be happy to post some, including some of my own stuff.  I don't think this is necessary. For things like music, which is rather gender-neutral, I don't see the point in a separate, dedicated subreddit. What do you think about a weekly or monthly thread in TwoX where songs were shared and discussed?

  For starters: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/WomenRock

http://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleVocalists FemaleVocalists is the closest thing to my vision. I think the intention of that sub is to include instrumental music as well.

A general music sub made up of TwoX users might be better than a multi -reddit of WomenRock+FemaleVocalists+WomenofMetal etc.

Maybe I'm just railing against the prevailing demographics, but I see an unmet need for a good music community here. 

What do you think of a weekly music thread on /r/TwoXChromosomes?

Are you named for the Zappa song Mud Club? I love that song. 

P.S. I also like french hip-hop.  I like the idea of a weekly music thread.  Music Mondays? FemaleVocalists is the closest thing to my vision. I think the intention of that sub is to include instrumental music as well.

P.S. I also like french hip-hop.  I love the idea of Music Mondays. A good way to build up steam and maybe then move to a complete subreddit if Music Mondays become too popular.

I had to unsub from /r/music because it was a lot of rote 'classics' getting reposted coupled with a weird hive-mind and no real conversation, just some patting on the back for songs the hive enjoys and downvotes for anything new or challenging. (I sound jaded as hell...) 

The only music subreddit I still follow is /r/altrap and it's pretty slow from day to day. I unsubbed from hiphopheads because they don't really challenge hiphip status quo and I felt constantly bombarded by objectifying and borderline abusive lyrics. /altrap still has issues but it's much easier to find music that doesn't degrade women. 

I'd love a subreddit that's well moderated and focused on sharing music that isn't hateful. I'm not really looking for any uplifting, lets-hold-hands stuff but I just don't want to have to sort through the "bitches and hoes," "all the boys, check me out because that's what I'm worth" and "you're a woman, so obviously you belong to me"songs. It can get exhausting... 

Also, bluegrass is pretty lacking on reddit.   French [Y&#233;-y&#233;]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C3%A9-y%C3%A9)

A little rock and roll, a little soul, a little jazz, a little pop. There were a lot of female vocalists associated with this style. I listen to a lot of French music, but sadly, no one I really know is into it.  &amp;gt;Can music be described as feminine / masculine?
Is /r/music[1] masculine?
What should the parameters of a Two X music subreddit be?
What kind of music do you think is underrepresented on reddit?

No, and I don't think it should be here. There is already a sub for female vocalists. I think making music into something gendered when it should be universal is depressing.

This is a subreddit for women and women's issues, not for female singers or music that you think is "feminine". What does that even mean? 

I like to listen to a lot of different music. Is some of it feminine or masculine? What about when I wear a cute summer dress and blast motorhead, am I being masculine? Or am I just listening to music? What about something like fleet foxes or grizzly bear that sounds really flowy and light but has male members? what is 'feminine' music? Why does it matter at all?

What about music that has a male singer but female members? What about music that talks about girls? What about music that's done by all girls but sounds like dudes? Is the distillers masculine? her voice sounds like gravel on a road. 



I just don't think its necessary. It's just going to be the favorite bands of people who post here a lot, not necessarily anything to do with women. And besides, I hate when someone listens to music because they like the members of a band or the fact that it's female-fronted or there are female members. Why not just like the music regardless of gender? 

I think music is better left up to the music subreddits  Thank you for answering the question about whether music can have masculine/feminine qualities. You raise good points and give good examples. 

&amp;gt;Why does it matter at all?

Because I like the idea of a general sub like /r/music but I don't like a great deal of the music there. I think that a general sub where more of the posters and voting members were female or female-identifying would produce a different music mix. 

&amp;gt;I just don't think its necessary.

Agreed

&amp;gt;It's just going to be the favorite bands of people who post here a lot, not necessarily anything to do with women.

I think music is better left up to the music subreddits  I totally agree that music should be left to the subreddits, but very (very!) few of the subreddits actually feel like safe places to discuss music, why we like what we do, offering up new stuff for others, discussing the politics of music personalities, etc... 

I think the female perspective on music is tremendously important, especially in 'male dominated' genres such as hip hop, punk and other genres that typically degrade/objectify women as defacto. 

I will never again post in /r/hiphopheads about how Hip Hop has seemingly stopped challenging the status quo on how certain communities treat their women... subreddits are supposed to be about the community discussion and there just aren't any subreddits dedicated to unearthing 'female-friendly' music of all genres. </snippet></document><document><title>[X-post from /r/sex] How female sexuality may be shaped be social factors; a massive literature review with some controversial findings.

Before I tell of the events, I have to describe my relationship with a couple people. 1. John Doe is a boy that I knew through my cousin. He did not go to my highschool, we have never hung out, but I have met him a few times. We have each other's numbers and have texted a couple times in the past. We are acquaintances, if that. 2. Brad Jones is a guy that went to my school but was a couple years ahead of me. I've seen him before, and I went to a small school so we both know of each other, but I have never had a conversation with him or formally met him.

About three weeks ago, on a Sunday night, I got a call at 10:15 p.m. I was already in bed. The caller was "Restricted." I, being dumb, answered the call. I guess there is always some curiosity with Restricted calls, even though you know they will probably be just a prank. As soon as I pick up, I hear incoherent screaming and crying. The man on the other line is explaining his situation, but I can't understand what he is saying. I ask him to slow down and I ask who he is. He says "It's John Doe you bitch, listen to me." I got a little scared after this, but I listened. He said "The brakes went out in my car and I'm stranded on the side of the road. Brad Jones told me you know how to fix brakes so you need to come out and help me." I was very confused at this point. I said, "I don't even know Brad and I sure as hell don't know how to fix your brakes." He said "I'm stranded, it's cold and it's late, and this is the last phone call I have before my phone dies." I said "Why did you call me?  I barely even know you, John." (At this point, I knew it didn't sound anything like John, and I know I should have been aware of the fact that It was probably not John, but I was so confused that I guess I still thought it was him.) He said "You better come fucking help me or I'll fucking kill you bitch!" I screamed a bit, saying "I don't know you or Brad and I can't help you" Then he raised his voice, screaming with the most rage I have ever heard, I couldn't tell what he was saying but the line cut off mid sentence. 

When the line cut off, I immediately texted John Doe's number saying "I don't appreciate you messing with me, especially at this time of night. Don't call me again."  John replied with "What?" I said "Did you just call me?" And he seemed really confused. I explained the situation to him and he had no idea what I was talking about, and said that he didn't know anyone named Brad Jones. He told me that he was in Chicago and was fine. I just played it off and said that it was weird and we said goodbye.  About ten minutes later I get a call from John saying that he also just got a call, but it was someone calling him telling him they were going to slit his throat. They were crying and screaming. 

I added Brad as a friend on facebook and messaged him explaining the situation, asking if he knew anything about it. He had  no idea what I was talking about, he didn't receive a call and did not know who John Doe was. I'm pretty freaked out at this point. Someone obviously was pretending to be someone else so that I would come out and meet them. 

The next day, I told my parents, (I'm 17) and they called the police station. The police said that it sounded serious and that they were going to track the number and that they would get back to me in a few days. A week goes by with no word from them, so my dad calls them. They had no idea what we were talking about or who we were. They had completely disregarded us, and acted like they were going to look into it. The guy on the phone (who was a different detective) said that there  was no file with this info in it and that the detective we spoke to didn't mention it to anyone or write anything down. Then he said "This isn't something we are interested in, we don't have time. Maybe if you were the governors daughter it would be something we would look at." I shit you not he said this. Appalled, we hung up. 

I took it to be just a weird prank until this past Sunday at exactly the same time, 10:15, I received another call. It was restricted, and my heart stopped. This time, I let it go to voicemail. I had a new voicemail within seconds. I listened to it and wanted to vomit. At first it was rustling, then someone playing the guitar very well. Then he started singing. It was a song that he had obviously practiced. He sang my name,*fake* (Krista Marie Cooke, why won't you pick up the phone? All I want to do is sing to you. I wrote a song for you. Why won't you listen?" and then the music stopped and he whispered "I'll be calling again." And the line clicked off. I immediately texted John, asking if he received anything and he said yes. He had a voicemail of someone playing the guitar, and singing John's address to him. 

Keep in mind that I know for a fact that this is not John. The weird thing is how this person connected us, I mean I barely know John. I don't know how they got my number and I don't know why they chose me. But I'm looking over my shoulder everywhere I go.       </snippet></document><document><title>Is it terrible that I want this for Valentine's Day some day? I lol'd when my friend showed it to me.

Large, meaty thighs (like Beyonce)? Awesome. They aren't my thing but I applaud the effort and the work.

Large, fatty thighs? That just screams poor nutrition and/or dietary habits. Maybe a lack of care as to your health. Not my thing, and not only that, it shouldn't be a thing.

Health should be emphasized more, instead of this silly body acceptance of any weight thing.

Someone who is starving themselves thin, unhealthily, should not be told, "oh it's okay to be like that." No, they should be told that what they are doing is unhealthy and that they should not abuse their bodies like that. Same goes with overeating / eating food that is not nutritious, resulting in fat. Or, how about trying to teach her that it as long as her legs do all the things she wants them to do, it doesn't matter what they look like? And that it doesn't really matter what strangers think of what her legs look like, as she is never going to please everyone?

Ugh ugh ugh Or, how about trying to teach her that it as long as her legs do all the things she wants them to do, it doesn't matter what they look like? And that it doesn't really matter what strangers think of what her legs look like, as she is never going to please everyone?

Ugh ugh ugh Because being unhealthy is a burden on me, as well.

My taxes pay for everyone, and I'm fine with that. I really am. In fact, I'm all for socialized healthcare (like in Canada!)

However, being unhealthily fat makes you have more health issues, which in turn means you spend more time and cost more money, in health issues. Being unhealthily thin is also a drain on society.

I'd rather more of my taxes go to education (especially STEM), and less to people that are unhealthy. 

Optimal society, yo.

Reference  Your statement is racist and classist. For those of us playing the home game poor people (who are overwhelmingly minorities) struggle more with obesity and related health issues in large part due to lack of access to better food and healthcare. Spending your precious tax dollars on STEM education won't allow prevention- and education-related health programs to be put into place to help solve this. 

Socialized healthcare isn't just a nice perk for healthy, employed people; it supports everyone or its not socialized healthcare. You don't get to say that an overweight person who needs diabetes medicine due to poor diet is less worthy of expensive care than a skinny drunk driver who wrapped their car around a tree. 

The purpose of healthcare is to get people healthy if they aren't and prevent them from having future health issues. I'd say your "drains on society" fit the bill for people who need care most.

I got the impression she just has normal womanly thighs and normal womanly curves.  And she doesn't want her daughter to grow up to feel ashamed of having a normal soft curvy female body.

I just feel like shit from all this, knowing nothing could be done. Are their other ways I can go about this so he doesn't just walk from all this?   Go back later, talk to another detective? Well, my detective has closed the case (at least I think, since he has not replied back to me), and I don't know know another detective would help.  Where do you live, approximately? Are you willing to provide specifics as to what he did? I live in the Ohio area and I rather not get into it that much over reddit.

We can't help you if we don't know what he is reported to do. ex boyfriend who pushed past the point of consent trying to change me from an asexual. Did some sucking on me, inserting fingers in me, and masturbating on me while I was tied down. He did a lot of dirty talking to me when I told him to stop doing it and coerced me into fingering him when I didn't want to. Did you agree to be tied down?

Did you tell him to stop fingering you, and then did he continue despite that? yes, yes, yes</snippet></document><document><title>How can I help my friend become more feminine without overstepping my boundaries?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bb2b/how_can_i_help_my_friend_become_more_feminine/</url><snippet>My roommate is very much a tomboy and a hardcore girl gamer. She wears baggy jeans, oversized game related t-shirts, never wears makeup, and cuts her naturally straight hair super short and leaves it parted in the middle. This is the way she's always been for as long as I've known her.

I'm much more feminine. I prefer to wear form flattering clothing and do my hair and makeup. Many times my roommate has looked at me and sighed and said, "You always look so pretty. I wish I looked as pretty as you." The thing is, she's a cute girl with a nice figure. I've offered to let her borrow my clothes or teach her how to do her makeup, but she says stuff like, "No thanks, I hate makeup" or "I don't like wearing dresses".

If my friend was happy with her tomboy style then I would never say a word about it. But she continually expresses an interest in appearing more feminine, then shoots my offers down. Just last night she was making fun of me for spending so much time painting my nails and straightening my hair, but then about 20 minutes later made a comment about how guys never approach her when we go out and that they often approach me because I'm so much prettier (again, I really don't think I'm prettier than her, I think it's mostly about how I present myself).

I know that her mom doesn't like her style and actively pushes her to dress more feminine and gives her a hard time about being a gamer and dressing unladylike, which I think is why my friend pushes back so much.

I want my friend to be happy and confident, and based on the things she's said it seems like she wants to learn how to be a little more feminine, but then she rebuffs all my offers. What should I do?  Be careful, saying she she's jealous of you being prettier isn't necessarily jealous of you acting more feminine.  Additionally, if her mom pressures her about this kind of stuff, she probably feels really conflicted about how she really wants to dress.

At the end of the day, if she says she doesn't like dresses and makeup, she probably doesn't.  Sure maybe it could be push back against her mom as rebellion, but it could also just be she is upset her mom criticizes how she likes to dress.

My advice is say something like "hey roommate, the other night you seemed down on how you looked and said you wished you were approached by more guys.  I think you're pretty and awesome and I want you feel that way too.  Is there anything I could do to help?"

My guess is she won't ask for help with looking more fem.  Don't push it.  Go with what she says and be there for her if she wants to talk.

 &amp;gt;Additionally, if her mom pressures her about this kind of stuff, she probably feels really conflicted about how she really wants to dress.

I think if her mom is pushing her to dress one way, and she is refusing to do so, she knows exactly how she wants to dress.   When she says " I wish I looked as pretty as you." answer her -
Why do you think you don't look as pretty as me? And listen.  

Her answer should give you an idea of what she is looking for.  Tomboy style can attract guys.  She doesn't have to more feminine, but she can work on her presentation. 

So, no skirts, no dresses, but nice fitting jeans might work for her.  And maybe some product in her hair to make it more interesting - think Pink (definitely not a girly girl)

 Pink is a perfect comparison. Whether you are man or woman, baggy clothes generally aren't doing you any favors. The description given makes it sound more like she doesn't really care that much about here appearance or perhaps she dosen't know where to start so putting some effort into the clothes she prefers to wear is a good start.

Basically this is me saying you are 100% right in you advice :p When she says " I wish I looked as pretty as you." answer her -

She hates dresses and make up. Those are not the only two ways to feel pretty or feminine. The number one way to feel pretty is to feel confident. Having your roommate suggest you change your style completely probably doesn't help.

I think the best thing you can do is this: next time she says "I wish I looked as pretty as you" respond with a sincere "I think you do. You're beautiful." Next time she says "I wish I was more feminine" say "I think you exude femininity. You're a strong beautiful woman." 

Respond to her self doubt with compliments instead of suggestions on how to improve - which only justify her self doubt - and watch how she'll be more confident because of it. &amp;gt;I've offered to let her borrow my clothes or teach her how to do her makeup, but she says stuff like, "No thanks, I hate makeup" or "I don't like wearing dresses".

I tell my friends all the time that I'm jealous of how tall and statuesque they are, how nice it must be to reach things on the top shelf and be able to have standing sex. That doesn't mean I'm going to get leg-extension surgery. 

Of course, if she specifically asks for help, feel free to teach her how to be more "feminine" (what does that mean?). Otherwise, you do you and let her do her.  Standing sex is overrated. Balancing is hard!  So is standing on tiptoe for so long!  I got a charlie-horse one time.  Unsexiest thing ever. Standing sex is overrated. I don't necessarily want to *have* standing sex. I just want to *be able* to have it.

I always date really tall guys, though, so I probably still wouldn't be able to post-surgery....

Thanks for the reassurance! I don't necessarily want to *have* standing sex. I just want to *be able* to have it.

Thanks for the reassurance!  She's not asking how to be more feminine. She's asking how to be more attractive. The two are completely different. 

Confidence is a huge part of this. My girlfriend wouldn't be caught dead wearing make-up, and her corpse would devour the flesh of any mortician who tried. She has the good hygiene of an Ebola outbreak, and would rather play videogames all day than pretend to be interested in anyone flirting with her. Men are attracted to her, anyways, because she never beats herself up for looks. Meanwhile, I have friends who model, and are "forever alone". They can point out why they aren't supermodels. They know their every character flaw. They envy what they don't have, and it's difficult to get excited about someone who is trying to get you unexcited about them. 

Teach your friend how to carry herself. Teach her how to flirt. She may need a more masculine/aggressive/whatever society calls it flirting style to work for her, or a shy adorkable one, but whatever can work for her, she won't get hit on, if nobody's getting any signals from her. 

Women can be "friendzoned" too. (God, I hate that word.) 

It just means there's no romantic or sexual chemistry.  Exactly. It's not about being feminine. She just isn't confident about herself. She wants to learn how to be attractive without changing who she is.  Doing your hair nicely and wearing fitting clothes isn't changing who you are, it's changing how you present yourself.

Sure, confidence is a huge part of attraction - a critical part. But it doesn't help if someone is wearing unflattering clothes. Wearing make up can help to make someone appear more attractive. 

These things shouldn't be dismissed so easily.  It looks like her mom may be pushing her own ideas of what is acceptable.  If she's giving her a hard time about her interests (gaming) she's sending the message that she needs to change.  That is a tough message to receive from the person who's supposed to love and accept you unconditionally.  It sounds to me that your friend doesn't need a makeover, but rather a change in outlook.  

If she expresses a desire to attract men, it can be very dangerous to say "here put this skirt on" because she'll be doing it to attract a man who is not drawn to her, but more to how you think she should look.  

There are all types of men out there with different tastes and interests.  Why not talk to her about what she's looking for in a guy, then seeking that guy?  

I'm all up for dressing yourself up and making yourself feel better, but that does not necessarily mean looking more feminine.  If she's comfortable in her tomboy appearance (as indicated by it being her default) maybe you could encourage her to dress up in more masculine clothes?  She does not want to be more feminine, I think she is expressing an interest in being more well put together but she rightfully is nervous about stepping out of her comfort zone, and she also probably has an issue seeing the middle ground between her look and your look, which sounds very primped all of the time. Like these others have been saying, there is a definite way for her to look more polished without sacrificing the things she enjoys and is comfortable in.

Wearing "masculine" clothing, jeans and t-shirts, is typical of a lot of us, but do you think that her choice in the fit of her clothing could stem from feeling self-conscious about her figure? You mention that she has a nice figure, but you know how often even the most stunning women fail to see themselves as they really are, and if her mother is pushing her to change it's all the more reason for her to feel self-conscious. If this is the case you have to start psychologically. If she is confident about her figure and just doesn't care about showing it, you can move forward differently.

Consider starting with those nights out that you mention, where she expresses a regret that she isn't receiving attention. If she is into it start "polishing" slowly for these nights out. Pair one of her game-related t-shirts with a slender cardigan (although you will have to do some creative work to keep the short sleeves from bunching in an unsightly way beneath the cardigan). Again if she is comfortable with her figure getting her to try on some fun, edgy skinny jeans could open her mind up to a new way of wearing pants. Don't try and put her in makeup. Play with her hair a little and see if any looks interest her. 

Like others have said, she isn't trying to be you, she doesn't want to borrow your clothes or your makeup. She wants to be her. Maybe you could convince her to go shopping some weekend for pieces that hit a good middle ground, but if she isn't comfortable with any of this it isn't going to last. I understand being a little flustered about her complaints paired with her lack of want to make changes but that is just something people do.            At the very least get her a side part stat Changing the way she styles her hair probably isn't going to change how she feels about herself. This is a confidence issue, not necessarily a hair issue.  oh come on, tell me you're not naive enough to believe confidence has nothing to do with how you think you look, ESPECIALLY when her complaints about herself come in the form of "I wish I was as pretty as you " and "I wish boys paid attention to me" not like "I wish people took me seriously" or "I wish I was smart"

obviously she needs some help matching her inside feelings to her outward appearance. It's a small step. side parting your hair makes a big difference and makes you look older and like you're putting effort into your appearance. it can make you appear more feminine even if you have a bad haircut. 

It's just a small step.  Please tell me you aren't superficial enough to believe that every woman who tells someone something like just needs a makeover.          </snippet></document><document><title>[UPDATE] Found the courage to break off a 7 year toxic friendship</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18azxj/update_found_the_courage_to_break_off_a_7_year/</url><snippet>Original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/13tpay/found_the_courage_to_break_off_a_7_year_toxic/

This update is probably not all that exciting, sorry! It's been close to three months since I've spoken to my best friend, and though I don't regret breaking the friendship off, with Valentine's day looming I'm struggling to keep a stiff upper lip. We used to send each other Valentine's day cards/gifts, and knowing that this year we won't...I dunno TwoX, I'm just sad. 

A week after my last post she deleted me from Facebook, making it clear that she didn't want to talk to me, or even try to fight for what we had. 7 years of friendship all for nothing. On top of that, to this day I still worry about her. She had problems with bipolar and suicidal thoughts, and I catch myself wondering if she's doing alright, if she's found someone to talk to, is she getting help etc. I know that's not my problem anymore and I am glad about it but...I guess despite her terrible behaviour and blatant disrespect towards me, I'll still always care about her to some degree. I don't know how to turn that off, maybe I never will. But the good news is I haven't gone back to her, I haven't initiated contact, nothing, nada. This Valentine's Day will just be spent watching Disney movies and reminiscing of happier times I guess as I shovel ice cream into my mouth. Geez, even though this was just a friendship, it almost feels like a romantic breakup. Same feelings I suppose.

In any case I wanted to thank everyone who commented on my last post. You guys were supportive and incredibly helpful and I thank you so much for being there! Keep up the good work TwoX, you're an invaluable support network of awesome people. :)  &amp;lt;Internet hugs&amp;gt;
Major anniversaries and holidays are always the hardest for breakups or deaths. This is a bit of both, IMO. The death of a friendship, a breakup of two people who spent copious amounts of time together. Celebrate the good times and acknowledge the problems for what they were. Be realistic about the relationship and how you feel now vs. how you felt then. Even write it down, so you have something concrete to go back to when you feel down. 
&amp;lt;more internet hugs&amp;gt;  Dude, you're awesome. I did something similar with a 5-year relationship in 2011. It was rough and it took a long time for me to stop pining for my ex-friend, but I realized how much better my life was without her. Now I have an awesome girlfriend with a relationship built on trust and communication, and that's pretty rad.  I just came to give you a glimmer of hope. December 2011 I told my best friend of almost 9 years that I could not be around her anymore. She was very unhealthy for me to be around and abused our friendship constantly. Now after a little over a year of thinking about those little things we used to do I got over it. I know I am not responsible for her and she is an adult. My friend was very depressed as well and there is a point where you have to realize that if they truly want to strive for happiness they will try to and it is not up to you to make it happen for them. I know I am happier without her in my life and I am relatively stress free now. What you did was for your own good as well as hers. Both of you will grow from this experience and maybe if you both want it you could try to be friends again, but you have to give each other that growth room first. Wow, thank you so much for your words, they really hit home for me too!  I guess that's the bottom line too, we're all big girls and should be acting/treating each other as such. I find that I really am happier without all that stress/bad feeling in my life, sometimes it's just easy to have a little pity party lol. Thank you for sharing! Gives me hope and warm fuzzy feelings to know there's a light at the end of tunnel :)  My husband just told his buddy he couldn't be in his wedding because of how toxic his fiance is. Said fiance isn't allowing her dude to hang out with my husband, thanks for giving me insight to his "break-up", he's been sad. Have fun with the ice cream and I hope you find a friend who is willing to fight for you!  I'm in the same situation with a long time friend.  Ending point was me dropping out of being a bridesmaid for her after she did some nasty name calling (for the upteenth time) when I had a last minute-time conflict for a dress fitting.  We still are going to her wedding next weekend.  I honestly have no interest in seeing her again, and I'm just going for the fun of it. Meep, good luck for the wedding next weekend, I don't envy you for that situation! Have a great time anyways, good way to stick it to her ;) It's tough when you've known someone for so long and then things go sour, hopefully things will work out for you!  Hi there!  Back in August, I ended a 9 year friendship with someone I often stated was like a sister to me.  She and I had been through a lot together and, in the end, I realized she was toxic for me and I needed to drop her.  It all came to a head after she got infuriated with me when I didn't drop life and drive over 2 hours to hold her hand as she stood on the side of the road waiting for the roadside assistance guy to show up.  She had two other friends there, and she blamed everything, down to the fact that they were wearing all black on a summer day, on me.  I didn't even have my car at the time, I was off with my family enjoying their company.  When I told her what I was doing at the time, she retorted with "F YOUR FAMILY!!  I NEEDED YOU!!!"  Only, she used the real word, I just do not wish to repeat it, it hurts to even think about it.

My point here is that in spite of all the horrible things I dealt with for 9 years while friends with this person, I still can't help but wonder how she is doing.  She also was the one who defriended me on facebook, so she made it clear she was closing that door.  I was grateful she took that decision out of my hands because I couldn't do that.  Her page was private to everyone but friends, as was mine.  A few weeks ago, I looked on facebook and was dinking around in privacy and settings and realized you could find out where you were logged onto Facebook at.  I clicked.  I had two active sessions going at once, which was odd.  One was from my current city, the other was from HER current city.  I had issues with her hacking my facebook and reading my stuff before, but I had changed my password TWICE since ending our friendship, and there she was AGAIN poking around in my facebook!!  I kicked off all existing connections to facebook and changed my password to something COMPLETELY different than ever before, and then proceeded to change my email password, too.  I had never felt so violated in all my life and in that moment, I felt like I was being shown just why I ended that friendship and that I had made the right decision.  Some days I want to cancel facebook completely, but then I refrain because I keep up with family from all over the country that way.

You made your decision for a reason...STAY STRONG!!!  Anytime you start to get sentimental and worry you made the wrong decision, think of all the BAD things and reaffirm you made the right one.  Stay away, don't cave and open up the lines of communication.  Do you really think your friend changed??  Likely your friend is the same person you left behind several months ago.  I understand the Valentine's day thing, I was the same way with my ex-friend, my 30th birthday is coming up, too, and she's missing out on it...but I am better off and so are you. Oh my god, are you me??? I was incredibly suspicious that she might have my log in information and was reading some of my personal messages. After our fall out I changed all my passwords just in case. The nerve of some people huh?? 

Thank you for your awesome words! Hell yeah we're strong, kickass ladies who don't need no horrible people in our lives. &amp;lt;hugs&amp;gt;     While ice cream is good, a spa day is amazing!  Even a homemade one.  Take care of yourself during this rough patch, okay?  </snippet></document><document><title>I'm a pear but I'm not plus sized and I'm not hyper toned, I'm just average. I can't be the only one!?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18b141/im_a_pear_but_im_not_plus_sized_and_im_not_hyper/</url><snippet>I am a pear. My measurements? 33 - 27 - 40 at 5 ft 8 and 136 lbs. I'm a very strange shape which doesn't make it easy to reconcile my figure to my love of fashion since a lot of the looks I love just don't work for me. So I'm always trying to find inspirational pictures of pear shaped women looking fashionable and gorgeous to boost my confidence.

The problem is whenever you search for pictures of pear shaped women they're either 'plus sized' (nothing against it, it's just not what I aspire to) or they're Beyonce/J-Lo/Shakira etc. (I like cake and I don't have a personal trainer, it's not gonna happen).

So where are the other women who are neither super toned nor overweight but still have a bit of extra junk in the trunk?  As the modern bard of our times, Kayne West, so elegantly put it: "She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string. And up top, uh, two bee stings." 

I love my shape, but never wear jeans/pants. I believe we have the **best** body for most skirts and dresses, especially ones that emphasize the waist and hips. I can rock a tea-party skirt. Plus, I was embarrassed that my thighs literally rubbed holes in pants . . .  Oh my god, I thought I was the only one this happened to... I'm sad that other women have this problem but also ummm...glad I'm not the only one. Oh my god, I thought I was the only one this happened to...

Plus, I was embarrassed that my thighs literally rubbed holes in pants . . .  "Skater" style dresses seem to be my HG item of clothing. Flowy down the bottom so it downplays my butt/thighs without hiding them completely, fitted at the top to emphasise my waist.  

I bought [this](http://shop.myer.com.au/shop/mystore/quirky-circus-by-mink-pink-angelina-velvet-dress) the other day and fuck everyone I look goddamn fantastic in it.   I'm pear shape too. 34-27-39, 5'7", and 135 lbs. I have broad shoulders too, so it kinda balances out my small chest; however, it makes it very difficult to find form fitting shirts that aren't trying to dig into my armpits. I end up needing a larger size just to accommodate my shoulders, but then the shirts look too big on the chest/stomach area. I actually really love my shape but it can be a downer when trying to shop for clothes (at least tops for me).  Whoa, I am the *exact* same measurements and weight as you. Smallish boobs/smallish waist/giant badonkadonk buddies! Isn't buying a bikini the worst??

Honestly, I play up my wide hips and booty. I feel sexy when I can wear a dress that cinches at the waist and flares out to show my figure. Thank God for Spanx. It's taken time but I really love my non-supermodel figure. Fortunately, I have met many men (and a couple of women) who are into small chests and generous behinds.   Average ~~pair~~ pear (where is my brain today?) checking in here. Trust me, you're not the only one. I have curvy hips and thighs and then pretty much nothing up top. Dresses are a pain in the ass to buy unless they're really flowy on the bottom or skin tight. But a lovely A-line? Forget about it.  I'm 33-26-38. I'm 5'4 and about 127 pounds. The hardest part is finding jeans that don't gap at the waist. 

Try to never wear loose bottoms with a fitted top because that will make you look disproportional (at least it does to me). I always try to wear well fitted pants and then any type of top I want.

Also, wearing dark bottoms and lighter tops will make it look more even also. I'm 33-26-38. I'm 5'4 and about 127 pounds. The hardest part is finding jeans that don't gap at the waist.

Also, wearing dark bottoms and lighter tops will make it look more even also. Wait, we have almost the same measurements (except I'm short)... where do you find jeans that don't gap? I'm not the user you responded to, but I love Levi's Curve ID jeans.  It's best to get fitted at a Levi's store though, if you're able, and try them on before you buy as there is some variance from pair to pair.  I don't know what I did before I found them, though.  No more having to wear belts and then them sliding up off the gathered pants and irritating my back! :) Wait, we have almost the same measurements (except I'm short)... where do you find jeans that don't gap? I recently got a pair of jeans from Banana Republic and they fit me perfectly. I got a size 27. What I've noticed, is to avoid the stores aimed at teens. For some reason all of my jeans with odd number sizes gap. (Odd numbers are usually for teens, and even ones are for adults.) But, stores such as American Eagle, with their even number sizing still fit weird. 

Edit: I accidentally wrote 37 instead of 27!  I can never wear AE pants. Or even shorts. Their sizing is so weird and anything that can fit my hips/bum is loose enough around my waist to [nearly] fall off.   You can still get a LOT of fashion inspiration from fat pear-shaped women. Looking at how they put an outfit together doesn't mean you're aspiring to look EXACTLY like them.

 I get a lot of inspiration from some fat fashion tumblrs because being fashionable isn't really about size, it's about style. And sometimes fat women have to work harder to pull off looks, so you can really get some innovative ideas. Just saying, don't rule them out! No, I totally get that bigger girls can be every bit as fashion conscious. But because loving my shape doesn't come naturally to me, I'm always trying to find women with a similar style and figure to sort of remind myself I don't look like the boy-chested-whale-hipped-thunder-thighed-monster that I sometimes see in the mirror....if that makes sense lol?  Play up your waist! Almost everything I have tapers at my natural waist. I don't think it matters how big or small you are if you demonstrate your shape clearly instead of wearing baggy clothes. I really think it makes a huge difference to highlight the smallest point in your midsection (and I actually think it's attractive when women have much wider hips in contrast). Keep eating cake, girl. Play up your waist! Almost everything I have tapers at my natural waist.

Keep eating cake, girl.  I'm 6'1" and 40-31-44 at 200 lbs.  I've got fairly toned legs but a bit of a jiggly stomach (yay genetics)...  No you're definitely not the only one, though I am also surprised at how few pear-shaped women I see out there. And I'm only 5'2, try being pear shaped and short! Not only do we have a hard time finding jeans that fit, I also have to stick to petite lengths, or I have to spend extra to get them hemmed. Besides that, I've never really had issues finding clothes that fit, except needing to avoid pencil skirts, skinny jeans, things like that. I'm also I guess what you would call "average weight" and though I've been self conscious about my large thighs, I've never really felt my shape was unattractive and have never had complaints from boyfriends. So you definitely shouldn't feel like there's something wrong with you! Fist bump for the 5'2 pear shaped sista! seriously, being pear shaped AND short is a nightmare for pants. It's like finding the missing link when you actually find a pair that fits off the rack!  33-26-42 at 5'6" - Roughly 130 lbs. In dresses "sized" to fit my waist I'm a 0. In dresses sized to fit my thighs I'm closer to an 8.  Obviously, this leads to frustration and confusion come shopping time.

Also, most of that 42" is settled 3-4 inches lower than normal, around my thighs rather than my hips. It's all fat, but it's the only fat I've really got on my body. It looks bizarre.

You know what's AWESOME? [Skater dresses](http://imgur.com/dT0rR78) are all over stores at the moment.

I'm not sure when it comes to fashion icons. I was hoping to find something when I got into the comments. Skater dresses are the saving grace of pears! But I just find it so frustrating when you see that gorgeous slinky number that would fit your lovely, tiny little waist so perfectly but then 'Nope, nope, not going over these thighs!' Yeah, even if I CAN fit it over my thighs it ends up looking like my thighs are trying to escape and it looks *bad*.

Also, I don't know if anyone has mentioned this or you knew it already but I will advocate for tailoring. There's not going to be anything off the rack really meant for us. Finding something that fits your widest part then tailoring down to fit the smaller parts is really where it's at. Mostly I have to do this with jeans (that ridiculous gaping waistband!) Skater dresses are the saving grace of pears!

It's horrible shopping for clothes, most tops (the longish kind you wear with leggings) fit well everywhere except at the hips, and it looks uncomfortably tight there. I always have to wear belts with jeans, or they slip down to my hips. 

I also tend to lose weight from my boobs but gain on my thighs, not sure if it's just me or my body type causing this.

Glad you started this thread, it's comforting to see I'm not the only one pear-shaped. :)

Measurements just barely outside of "standard" misses sizing, but typical "plus" clothing still fits too big on me. Commenting here so I can check back after work and see what suggestions other lovely ladies have :)    I'm like a mini version of you! Similar measurements sized down for a petite girl. It makes dressing a little challenging, especially being a total fashion addict, but I love being a slightly squishy pear shape :-D Work it girl! Fashion is like the cruellest obsession for pear shapes, isn't it?! Every time I open a magazine and see 'Oh, dropped hemlines are in this season? That hit-ya-on-your-fattest-part length will look great with my thunder thighs!' I get just a little bit crestfallen lol.  And yet I always think "well maybe this time..." and [then](http://imgur.com/psVCZUC). Ah well, we can ROCK the pencil skirt and the 40's-50s silhouette. I know pencil skirts and midi dresses are all I wear now. And 90% of the time I won't leave the house without heels on. They just make me feel soooo much better about myself.  Please tell me where you are getting your pencils skirts and midi dresses! I hate shopping, need to know a store is working for a fellow pear-shaped lady. :) Banana Republic and Express are my go to stores for pencil skirts and work clothes in general. Make sure to get the ones the hit at or just below the knee. I find if it falls above the knee it makes you look even hippy-er.

P.S. If you are worried about price sign up for their mailing lists. I constantly get coupons for 40% of my purchase or 15$ off a 50$ purchase. I don't go to either store without a coupon in my email box. Please tell me where you are getting your pencils skirts and midi dresses! I hate shopping, need to know a store is working for a fellow pear-shaped lady. :) I'm in the UK so I don't know how helpful my shopping habits will be but I buy from Primark, River Island, New Look and Asos. Asos actually ship to America for free and their jersey midis fit me perfectly!   I understand!  36-25-42 at 5'10" and 150lbs here.  I've completely given up on finding pants that fit and just wear dresses all the time.  I find that retro 40's-60's fashions work pretty well for me.  Also wearing normal people dresses with leggings or something because the skirts are often too short for me.  It takes a lot of material to cover my ass.   I know **exactly** what you mean! As if dress shopping wasn't hard enough being 5 ft 8 I have to spend the entire night tugging the meant-for-tiny-humans dress down just to make sure I'm not flashing the people behind me. Which, if I'm wearing a boob tube dress, just results in me flashing the people in front instead! Eurgh. Oh! But midi dresses are the saving dress for taller girls! One trend that finally works for us! I understand!  36-25-42 at 5'10" and 150lbs here.  I've completely given up on finding pants that fit and just wear dresses all the time.

It takes a lot of material to cover my ass.        My best friend is THE definition of pear. Her waist is MAYYYYYBE 25 inches, and she wears a padded AA bra.... But dayuuuum does she have an amazing butt/hip combo. (If it's not obvious, I'm insanely jealous: I am a stick-straight boy-body with a nonexistent chest, waist, or ass.) She is a bit thinner than you, but her body shape is nearly identical. 

Anyway, she always manages to look phenomenal by thirft-store shopping or keeping an eye out for vintage styles: higher waists (all her low-rise pants gap around her midsection, but if they're truly high-waisted they fit and slim perfectly), empire waist cuts, belted skirts, pleats, wide legged pants, etc. She avoids drop-waist clothes and the "baggly" fad [like [this](http://store.americanapparel.net/product/?productId=rsa0301w)]. 

She always looks AMAZING - so don't fret! You don't have to be plus-sized *or* Beyonce to rock your body type. For example, I'm only 5'6", which means I can't be cute+petite like Nicole Richie or tall+stunning like Karlie Kloss. I am just an average-sized girl with a stupid stick boy body. But I make it work!     This might get lost in the comments at this point, but what do you ladies do regarding workout clothes (specifically bottoms)? I had a pair of sweat capris that I looooved...to the point that I wore them to death and had to throw them out. I currently alternate between shorts, which I find embarrassing because of my chubby pasty legs, and yoga pants, which though I honestly think I don't like terrible in them, they make me feel self-conscious. I prefer capri-length for working out but always have such a hard time finding bottoms that are suitable for both my height (I'm 5'2) and shape. Any suggestions, especially from those of you who are also short? On more self conscious days I have a pair of ultra baggy tracksuit bottoms I wear - they're not flattering but they make me feel...*hidden*, I suppose. On days where I can be sensible and remind myself I'm going to a gym and no one cares (few and far between lol), they're the days I just throw on a pair of leggings and a baggy t shirt. Yeah tracksuit bottoms would be good, but due to my height, I have a hard time finding some that are a good length. A friend of mine, not pear-shaped but short, says she shops for workout clothes in children's sections! And I honestly am not concerned about wearing gym clothes that are flattering or attractive, so long as they're not UNflattering, you know? Men's. That's usually my answer. I just buy a short pair of men's tracksuit bottoms and roll them at the waist if necessary (not often necessary, I'm tall and 90% leg). Works a treat! This might get lost in the comments at this point, but what do you ladies do regarding workout clothes (specifically bottoms)? I had a pair of sweat capris that I looooved...to the point that I wore them to death and had to throw them out. I currently alternate between shorts, which I find embarrassing because of my chubby pasty legs, and yoga pants, which though I honestly think I don't like terrible in them, they make me feel self-conscious. I prefer capri-length for working out but always have such a hard time finding bottoms that are suitable for both my height (I'm 5'2) and shape. Any suggestions, especially from those of you who are also short? I've always put leggings on underneath my shorts during the colder months (if I'm going to wear shorts, that is); it makes me feel more covered and secure. Also wearing longer shirts with tapered waists, that cover my butt, makes it feel more "comfortable" while wearing yoga/workout pants. I like the capris/ pants that also have "fold over" waists and aren't tight in the calves--it's a nice balance in leg shape, and the higher waist is adjustable. Have you tried anything like that?  Oh my gosh, as a short pear with a little tummy, it's RIDICULOUS trying to shop!

I try and wear dresses, but it can't go it too much at the waist because it pops out my tummy! There's no way to win! Try high waisted trousers and dresses that drape over your tummy but cinch in at the waist. Think pleats, nothing too tight.        I'm a pear shape at 4'9" and I weigh about 135. All of my "thick" is in my hips, butt, and thighs. My waist is tiny and I have 34DD boobs. 

Needless to say, it's hard to find clothes.  I'm p sure that's closer to an hourglass than a pear? I'm a pear shape at 4'9" and I weigh about 135. All of my "thick" is in my hips, butt, and thighs. My waist is tiny and I have 34DD boobs. 

Needless to say, it's hard to find clothes.  Hey, if your waist is tiny and you're quite short.. Are you sure you should be wearing a *34* DD and not something with a smaller band (and corresponding cup)? Or is your ribcage very wide compared to your waist? If not, check out /r/ABraThatFits - a lot of us used to wear the wrong bra size, but a better-fitting bra makes a big difference :) &amp;gt;Hey, if your waist is tiny and you're quite short..

I need to!! My boyfriend can fit his hands around my waist &amp;amp; ribcage, but my boobs are enormous.   5'7" here, 32-26-36. Not very much pear, but I've only ever been small-chested, so it adds to the appearance. Also I remember offhandedly mentioning that I was pear-shaped to an uncle and he flipped his shit, suddenly got over-assuring that my figure was fine, "see that woman over there, *she's* pear-shaped (narrow shoulders, bulbous middle, no hips, and skinny legs)" etc. I had to calm him down and explain that pear simply meant wider hips.

While on this topic, does anyone else ever get irritated by the insinuation that hips/butts are undesirable? "Should have the hips of a nine year old boy" and all that? What the hell is wrong with having hips? How else am I expected to bear children? And men find hips and butts very attractive!  5'7" here, 32-26-36.

If you're bust and hips are the same you're either an hour glass, or a "straight/banana" body type (in your case, you're an hourglass, since your waist is ten inches smaller than your bust and hips). Pears have busts that are smaller than their hips.    You aren't the only one! Before I got sick, I was 33-26-38. I loved my look and so did my husband. He is always telling my he wants me back to my weight before, as I am too skinny now and he wants my ass back ;) Your shape isn't strange at all, it is awesome!</snippet></document><document><title>How do you feel about intentionally skipping your period?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cz4k/how_do_you_feel_about_intentionally_skipping_your/</url><snippet>I have a trip coming up this weekend and I am scheduled to get my period on the Sunday. I really don't want to have it because we will be staying at my boyfriend's friend's place and I just don't want to feel uncomfortable, bloaty and gross. I just don't want to be a bummer.

However, I'm weary about skipping my period by just moving on to the next pack of birth control pills. I've been on it for 7 years (without stopping) and haven't skipped my period in about 5. I feel it's going to be uncomfortable either way.

I guess what I'm asking is, can I just take one pill from the new pack so that I only skip it for one day? I don't wanna really skip it for the whole month.  Just skip it. It won't hurt you at all (I haven't had a period since December and I'm doing fine and dandy).    </snippet></document><document><title>The bittersweet story of Mary Walker, badass and Union surgeon in the Civil War</title><url>http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/02/mary-walkers-quest-to-be-appointed-as-a-union-doctor-in-the-civil-war/272909/</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Ladies, do any of you have any experience with DHEA?

Need advice and support.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/189nnd/update_boyfriend_almost_killed_me_and_friends/</url><snippet>He came home last night, went upstairs and didn't speak to me. Today, I told him I would not be accepting his behavior, and asked how he felt about it. After a lot of blaming me, and me telling him I wouldn't take responsibility for his actions, he finally seemed to get it.
He never did apologize on his own, though, only after I told him that I had apologized when he had not. Yes, I may have been in the wrong for "flirting" with another person - which he has been guilty of many times in the past, making me assume it was ok - but I did not deserved to be treated like that, nor did my friend and his brother.

He left about an hour ago, his stuff in tow. I'm very relieved that I will not have to deal with him anymore, and frankly, I don't think he'll ever understand how much of an anger problem he has. I'm just scared about finances now and starting to look at apartments.

I am so thankful to you all for helping me through this. I have a few great girlfriends, but nothing could compare to the overwhelming support from all of you. I read every post, and it helped me gain the strength and courage I needed. I blocked his number, and am confident in my decision. Here's to turning over a new leaf.  And do not take him back. Do not take him back. Do not take him back. Whatever he says, **do not take him back.** I have made this mistake many, many times Advice or ways to avoid the taking back? For...OP, of course. Do not try to reason with all the terrible things he's done.

Remind yourself constantly of all the terrible things he did, how it affected you, and if he apologized later.

Ask close friends/family who know him, have seen you two together, and heard about how he treats you. Ask them to remind/support you through realizing what a douchebag he really is.

Avoid him at all costs. Cut off all communication. Do not "just check" his profile for one second or anything of the sort. Have your friends control this as well if you don't trust yourself.

Remove all memories of him and try to move on by doing other things, have a vacation to celebrate your happy return to being single. I would add to this...don't shame yourself or let other people shame you if you DO have feelings of desire or longing for him.  Those coexist with all of the things that are so important to be reminded of that CrazyBohemian listed above.  It's important to recognize that it's normal and to be expected that even after doing the craziest unacceptable shit, you have a mulitiplicity of experiences with someone and some of them did feel positive to you and that's real. Denying that won't help.  But recognizing those occur in a context where all the other shit happened to...that's the important thing.  It can be really hard to hold that both/multiple information stuff...but it sorts itself out over time...just important to honor that you feel that stuff (which is different than acting on it)..and get help being reminded of the bad stuff will help with that...I've found that shaming or feeling wrong for having any of those other feelings cause you're "supposed to know better" doesn't help things.  But if you can take a hard line re your commitment/intention to not take him back and have people who support you ALSO allow that doesn't preclude that you'll have to float through a few of those other feelings...it'll help the process proceed naturally....

good luck... Do not try to reason with all the terrible things he's done.

in the past I've found that writing a pros and cons list helps spell it out in black and white. I think that even though the pros will have a few bullet points, you'll find that the cons list will be much longer.

And yeah I'm so fucking glad she got the hell out of there, that dude sounds like a right nutcase :|  Thank goodness he is out of the house.  I'll keep good thoughts for you finding affordable housing.

I didn't look up the original thread, so this might be redundant:

Keep your guard up and do not allow him anywhere near you for the near future.  Abusers are the most dangerous shortly after a breakup.   By dangerous, I mean physically harming you.   Don't be alone, and if you are, keep aware of your surroundings.  This is not meant to scare you, it is meant to keep you safe.

Probably most people know this from news reports/Oprah shows!  But abuser's rage is out of control once they are separated from their victim.  

One article:  http://www.domesticabuseshelter.org/InfoDomesticViolence.htm

Shortcut:  Of the total domestic violence homicides, about 75% of the victims were killed as they attempted to leave the relationship or after the relationship had ended.   (((hugs)))

I used to cry   
but now I hold my head up high     
and now you're back    
from outer space    
I just walked in to find you here    
with that sad look upon your face    
I should have changed that stupid lock    
I should have made you leave your key   
if I'd have known for just one second    
you'd be back to bother me!    
go on now GO   
Walk out the door    
just turn around now   
Cause you're not welcome anymore    
Aren't you the one who tried to hurt me with your lies    
Did you think I'd crumble?    
Did you think I'd lay down and die?   
Oh no not I!!!   
I will survive!!!

[Link for the lazy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBR2G-iI3-I)  &amp;lt;-----70's goodness right here.  Original post?     This guy is a flaming shitcase. A cheap, stupid, reckless, cheap, negative cheap shit case who has no business around anyone. Good for you for leaving.

Im not sure why him being cheap makes it so much worse, but it does.  I like you get downvoted for saying that something that everybody here agrees with, but doing so using harsh language.  When I first read it my brain autocorrected "shitcase" to "suitcase" and took it to mean that the person had to much emotional baggage.   I like you get downvoted for saying that something that everybody here agrees with, but doing so using harsh language.    I heard from How I met your mother that it helps to write yourself a letter of why you broke up with him, all the cons no pros.  And if you find yourself 'well I could give him another shot' you open the letter and read it.  You did a fantastic thing.  ((((hugs))))  You've got us here.  And while we all may never meet in person... we're here for you always. That's a fantastic idea.

And while we all may never meet in person... we're here for you always. Often, I would advise against taking advice from that show... But this time, it seems like an incredibly good idea!                   What a nutcase. He would only cause more problems down the road. People like that don't change until they become self-aware and it doesn't look like that's happening. Trust me, as long as you are moving forward in your life somehow, it will get better. Much better. The worst thing to do would be to stay stuck in a rut. Move forward a little at a time, even if it's the harder choice. Good luck! ...and even when self aware...don't necessarily change.  That's my kryptonite.  I've def been on the receiving end of that mess.  Confusing their capacity for self awareness with the potential capacity to change...while change was noooot occurring... :/                Anything he left behind, ANYTHING, no matter how miniscule: box it up and leave it by the front door.  If he comes back because he "left (blank) accidentally", don't let him in, don't let him discuss, just shove the box at him and close the door.  He will try to get you back, more than likely.  Don't listen.  You did the right thing, and it is completely normal to miss him and want him back, the key is in remembering why you asked him to leave and how he made you feel, and remembering that those actions were not just a one time thing and were symptoms of a larger problem.

Maybe he goes to anger management.  Congratulate him, and do not take him back.  Tell him you are happy for him, but that you closed that chapter of your life a while ago, and being with him would open too many old wounds (even if it isn't true).  Keep cutting him out of your life.

And I'm proud of you for finding the strength to do this.  Good luck. &amp;gt; Anything he left behind, ANYTHING, no matter how miniscule: box it up and leave it by the front door. If he comes back because he "left (blank) accidentally", don't let him in, don't let him discuss, just shove the box at him and close the door.

Better yet, just leave it outside or send it off to him or a relative.  He doesn't get to come back to your space! Depending on the area you live in, I would be cautious about leaving it outside (because then it gets stolen and he blames you and guilt feedback loop of terribleness), but leaving it with a relative of his is a great idea.  Anything to keep him out of the apartment and your life.   After reading most of the last post and all of this one I have a couple of things to say and a question. My question would be the whole *do not take him back* thing. I am actually a bloke and I have trouble understanding the need for people to say this. (I generally stay away from people who I am scared of suffering physical harm at the hand of) It seems to me that there is a more deep seated issue at hand for the OP then just this one bloke. So if someone could explain it I would be grateful. When a person breaks up a long term relationship, sometimes they second guess that decision... they get lonely, nostalgic for the good times, convince themselves it wasn't that bad, or the other person comes back with apologies and sweet talk and gets back into their life.  The returning abuser might be on best behavior for a time, but the old patterns of control and abuse will resurface more often than not.  Do some abusers get therapy and straighten up?  Sure, but not usually.  Abusers who reunite with the subject of their abuse often "punish" the partner for daring to stand up to them.  Hence, "do not take him back".  
It is dangerous, and being forgiving can be the first step in repeating the pattern.  
edited for clarity cheers it makes a certain amount of sense to me. Very hard to visualise though.  Wise man once said "there is no love in fear". Actually idk if he is really all that wise but I feel it is a correct and true statement. Repeating the past and expecting a new result is a pretty effective way of repeating patterns though, that is for certain. We sure do suffer for our frailties sometimes.              I'm sorry, but do you mean "killed me" in some euphemistic sense? Because all I see here is

&amp;gt;He came home last night, went upstairs and didn't speak to me. Today, I told him I would not be accepting his behavior

Did he actually try to kill you or are you saying something else entirely? Please be more clear in your writing. This is an update. In her previous post she describe how he almost killed her and her friend by driving really fast in a fit of rage (I think he was also drink driving based on the context?) Ah, okay, found the post, thanks.

Yeah, he doesn't sound like a good guy.      Make me miserable once, and it's shame on you. Make me miserable twice, and it's shame on me. Make me miserable once, and it's shame on you. Make me miserable twice, and it's shame on me. I would like someone to say why you got downvoted.  Is it because you didn't join the 'kick him to the curb' chorus? It's victim-blaming. Abusive relationships are much more complex than "well you let him make you miserable more than once."   [deleted] What the hell are you talking about?

Thanks you in advance for taking time to read this. I'm a teen girl who's been ill recently, and was wondering if any of you ladies had experienced this. 

For the past 3 weeks or so, I've been feel nauseous quite a lot, particularly in the morning. (There is absolutely no way that I'm pregnant!) Then my time of the month came very early, which is unusual. It also only lasted a day, which has never happened to me before, but I suffered from intense stomach, back, hip and leg pain, again which is new to me. Although the pain when I've had my time has been getting more intense each month, it's never lasted so long or been so bad. Now, I'm back to feeling sick and am extremely tired. 

I have no idea what this could be, neither does my doctor. Would appreciate any comments! Thanks again!

Why Women Love Watching by Aurora Snow</title><url>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/11/porn-isn-t-just-for-men-why-women-love-watching.html</url><snippet>   Speaking as a woman (and one who likes to think of herself as educated and more or less liberal when it comes to social issues), I am fully, completely, and 100% anti-porn. That gets me into a lot of trouble when I have discussions in feminist circles, but there it is.

But on another note, I actually find this article to be very generalizing towards both genders. "Men like this, women like that. Men are into this, women are into that." It's rarely that simple, and it takes away from any point this article was trying to make. Could you give your reasons for being anti-porn? A shortened version is absolutely fine if you'd rather not write out an essay, and a PM would be fine if you'd rather not post anything here. Yeah I'm really curious as well. I maybe can see being against the porn industry in general because some of it does have a dark side and moral qualms or whatever but what about amateur porn? Or videos of people having sex in general? Just no to all of it? 

 I just answered your questions in a post above you, so if you still want to read about it, it's there. 

I think in an ideal world, all porn would be like that x-art (or whatever it's called) stuff, where it's basically love-making and very respectful towards the women. Sadly, the overwhelming majority is nothing like that. I'm anti-porn, the way the porn industry is now. If two people who love each other and are respectable towards each others want to film themselves having sex and put it on the internet, that is absolutely fine.  However the abuse of women is absolutely not.  [deleted] Could you give your reasons for being anti-porn? A shortened version is absolutely fine if you'd rather not write out an essay, and a PM would be fine if you'd rather not post anything here. I'm anti-porn too. I used to think all women in porn were fine with porn, they wanted to be in it, they loved it and they got paid well and that's that. But that is very far from the truth. Yes, the top actresses probably want to be there and are paid well, but not all ladies are so lucky. There are so many examples of porn where women are dead in the eyes, clearly not wanting to be there. Are being borderline abused (or sometimes even being abused), even porn in which they are doing things they didn't agree to to begin with but end up doing anyway for a little more money. I mean yeah, you could say, just don't watch that porn. But that doesn't make it better for the sisters in the porn. They are being abused and it is definitely NOT okay. I will post a few examples of porn that is not okay in any way. It destroys these women, if not physically, then mentally. Please, don't click them if you're triggered easily.

There is so much more, this doesn't even cover the tip of the iceberg. Why is this okay? And in case there's still some doubt over if women want to be in that kind of stuff, watch/listen to this:

This one is more about prostitution, but can be applied to porn as well: 

http://www.andreadworkin.com/audio/TraffickingConference1989_P1_M.mp3

Please ask more questions if you have any. I assume that you hold similar views on prostitution? If not, can you explain why not?

Also, where do you sit on BDSM between consenting adults? I mean this outside the sphere of any of it being recorded.

Not asking any of this to trip you up or anything, just looking to understand a somewhat differing viewpoint. Thank you for what you've shared thus far. I definitely do. I come from a country where prostitution is legal and I'll tell you that many of the girls you'll see standing there are Eastern European women, brought here by pimps. They are being exploited, they don't have the means to get out of prostitution a lot of the time and they are not doing it because it's a good way to spend their time. Even with a lot of the Belgian/Dutch women in prostitution you see a lot of "well I have to do it, I need the money" and other reason like those. If you truly want to get into prostitution, that's fine, you're a grown adult and you can make your decisions, but a lot of women come here with the promise of a dancing/acting/modeling career and find themselves in prostitution. That cannot be right. And a lot of women that start out wanting to be a prostitute then change their minds and have a very hard time leaving the job, for whatever reason (people know she was a prostitute, they won't hire her. She doesn't know where to go, how to start making money...). Our sisters are being bought and sold for as little as 90$. They get them from poor European countries and bring them over and put them there, forced to work here, not able to speak the language, not having a way to get out of the mess.

If you want to know more about prostitution and human trafficking, you can read up on their site. 

I am BDSM-critical, but like I said if you're a grown adult, you can do what you like. I don't want to enforce laws on people prohibiting them from sexual acts. However, where does the desire come from to hit someone until they bruise in a dark purple colour? Where does the desire come from to be bruised like that? Would you do it if someone asked you to spank them until they can't sit down anymore? These are all questions I asked myself and I don't see how a simple "I want to" is enough to answer those. Surely those desires come from somewhere? 

But like I said, if BDSM is your thing, you do your thing. I'm just critical of it. 

Thanks for asking, I like sharing my views on this and I like seeing what others have to say :) It's.. interesting, in a way.

Presumably the desire for sex workers will always be there. Presumably the desire to consume porn will always be there. But, if there are more people being hurt (sex trafficking, things forced in porn) by a particular industry than helped (by having jobs in that industry etc) does that then mean the industry itself is fundamentally flawed and should be legislated against? Or does the fact that some people choose to do it, and are comfortable doing it and suffer no ill effects, even if they're a minority mean that the industry itself is not flawed, but that the support network is?

And in a sense some of that flows on to BDSM. Presuming two (or more) consenting adults wish to partake, and presuming they do it safely, is there genuine harm in it?  I agree that the desire for both those things will always be there. There are things that can be done to help prostitutes and stop trafficking. I have no answers for how to keep the abuse out of porn, I think the only way to do that is to change societies attitudes about it, ask them why it's okay. Whether they'd want their sister, mother, daughter, friend to be treated like that and if not, why is it okay that this woman is going through it. 

People could consume porn that isn't violent and isn't abusive, I have no idea how we'd stop these videos being made and distributed, but I think a change in attitude is our biggest chance at that. 

I think if the majority in an industry is suffering, something is wrong, whether it's the support system or the industry itself is.. in my opinion, it's a bit of both. I can't and don't want to stop people doing from what is their right to do. But I won't sit here and pretend porn is okay because some people enjoy it. Our sisters are more important than our orgasms. 

Presuming that about BDSM, then no there is no genuine harm to it or a direct threat. I'm just critical of people who'd hurt other people in that way (whether one begs for more lashings or not, it still takes a special mindset to provide those lashings). Again though, I don't want to take away people's right to do anything, if they want to they can do it. Doesn't stop me from wondering what's behind it and whether it's healthy (mentally, emotionally). I mean after a BDSM "scene" they go through extensive aftercare, because even though they wanted it, it was traumatic, if not mentally then definitely physically. No person in BDSM will deny the importance of aftercare, it just makes me wonder. I don't think having a kink protects one from criticism of that kink.  Couldn't you argue that it takes an equally special mindset to take the lashings? You could go a step further and suggest it takes an even more special mindset, given that while one would be providing the lashings, they would still be held to a contract of sorts that should the masochistic person say a single word, or perform a single action, they would have to stop.

I do agree with you on the last sentence, though I kind of agree with that in a general broad ranged way regarding a lot of things - which is perhaps partially why I like to hear viewpoints that are not my own and which I even may disagree with so much. While there must be some respite from constant questioning, much wisdom can be gained in challenging previously held points of view on a regular basis. I just want to say that I really enjoyed this conversation with you and it's been nice thinking about your questions and reading your views. 

I do think it takes an equally special mindset to take them. That is why I don't want to outlaw BDSM (not that I could anyway). What people want is what they want. It's a special kind of relationship, but I can't help but feel that there is something there that enables the dom to do those things and the sub to take those things. I don't know what it is, according to some it's a form of woman-hating and internalized hate, but I don't believe that. I don't know what it is so I'm afraid I can't provide an answer to that, but I remain critical of it. At least until I can find out what it is or be convinced otherwise.  I definitely do. I come from a country where prostitution is legal and I'll tell you that many of the girls you'll see standing there are Eastern European women, brought here by pimps. They are being exploited, they don't have the means to get out of prostitution a lot of the time and they are not doing it because it's a good way to spend their time. Even with a lot of the Belgian/Dutch women in prostitution you see a lot of "well I have to do it, I need the money" and other reason like those. If you truly want to get into prostitution, that's fine, you're a grown adult and you can make your decisions, but a lot of women come here with the promise of a dancing/acting/modeling career and find themselves in prostitution. That cannot be right. And a lot of women that start out wanting to be a prostitute then change their minds and have a very hard time leaving the job, for whatever reason (people know she was a prostitute, they won't hire her. She doesn't know where to go, how to start making money...). Our sisters are being bought and sold for as little as 90$.

I really don't think you should pathologize people that are into BDSM. It's about trust and intimacy and the rush of it. Just because there's wips and chains involved doesn't mean love isn't involved. Where do *your* desires come from? I suggest you actually talk to people about it before being so critical. You said in a perfect world, all porn would be romantic X-art stuff. I disagree. In a perfect world, there would be no trafficking in porn and people would be able to access whatever style of porn they want. &amp;gt;In a perfect world, there would be no trafficking in porn and people would be able to access whatever style of porn they want.


Curious... does that include child porn, as well? Wow. No. Did you not see anything I said about consent? Children cannot consent  I am very well aware that children cannot consent. And in the post of yours that I was replying to, you didn't mention anything about consent. I *assumed* you were not including child porn in your statement, but I was  curious. You simply said "whatever style of porn they want," so I asked for clarification.

I've seen child porn defended on Reddit before, so I never feel like it's safe to assume anything. &amp;gt; However, where does the desire come from to hit someone until they bruise in a dark purple colour?

You said in a perfect world, all porn would be romantic X-art stuff. I disagree. In a perfect world, there would be no trafficking in porn and people would be able to access whatever style of porn they want. I've actually done a lot of talking to and reading up on BDSM. I'm not saying love isn't involved. Love is definitely involved and yes, it is very intimate. 

I didn't say all porn would be romantic. I said all porn should be like x-art, where the women are respected and the people in it care about their orgasms and they are not abused (and no, when I say abused I don't mean spanked or something.). 

Whether or not I'm pathologising people in BDSM in debatable, I'm critical of it. Does that mean I think they're psychopaths who are not capable of love, no. But, it does mean that I'm not just going to take their word for it when they say it's nothing. Or for the thrill. In my opinion there's more behind it. However, like I said again I would never dream of forcing people to stop doing whatever sexually. 

Have you seen the porn videos I put up there? In your ideal world that is fine, young boys and girls should be allowed to grow up seeing that? Do you know porn is made where a woman is actually raped and that is freely available on the internet? Is that okay? No, it is not. I don't care how much people want to jerk off to it, it is not okay. I, in no way, said that all porn should be romantic and slow and arty though. When I mentioned x-art I only mentioned them because it's known the women working for them get treated pretty well. Have you considered the fact that parents should actually talk about porn with their kids? Whether I think kids should grow up seeing it is irrelevant. It's there, along with all sorts of fucked up shit. They need to be educated. As long as everyone is consenting, people can make whatever violent porn they want. Watch the videos and tell me if you think those girls are doing it with full consent. 

Parents should talk about porn with their kids, but no matter what parents say, kids will watch porn. And if their brains are filled with the kind of stuff I've posted there from the age of 11-12, what kind of people do you think we're going to see? You think those people will respect women? After watching women being degraded and hurt like 3 times a day? After watching women being treated like shit? Do you really think a 12 yo boy is going to be able to make the distinction between that and "real life girls". Do you think a young girl will not internalize that and think sex is supposed to hurt and it's okay when your boyfriend spits in your face and calls you a whore? 

Many women get into porn for many reasons and just because they signed a contract at the start of it, doesn't mean they're okay with what's happening in the rest of the film. Go on, please watch those videos and tell me if that is okay for you. Do those women look like they're enjoying the violent porn? Do they look like they wanna be there? Or do they look like they're young women tricked into thinking they could make easy money, fast. Thinking it wouldn't be so bad. 

To think every woman in those porn videos or even most women in those porn videos are there because they 100% want to be or that they are enjoying themselves at all would be lying to yourself. *To think that it is okay for them to undergo that violence because they signed a contract before starting and "consented" and are afraid they will get no money if they say no now, is doing a huge disservice to those women.*

I am convinced you have not watched the videos I have put up and you think the violence I'm talking about is a bit of bondage and some spanking. Go look and if you seriously still think that is okay because everyone has the right to make and watch whatever violent bullshit they make, then please don't talk to me because not only do I have nothing to say to you, I want nothing to do with you.  I'm anti-porn too. I used to think all women in porn were fine with porn, they wanted to be in it, they loved it and they got paid well and that's that. But that is very far from the truth. Yes, the top actresses probably want to be there and are paid well, but not all ladies are so lucky. There are so many examples of porn where women are dead in the eyes, clearly not wanting to be there. Are being borderline abused (or sometimes even being abused), even porn in which they are doing things they didn't agree to to begin with but end up doing anyway for a little more money. I mean yeah, you could say, just don't watch that porn. But that doesn't make it better for the sisters in the porn. They are being abused and it is definitely NOT okay. I will post a few examples of porn that is not okay in any way. It destroys these women, if not physically, then mentally. Please, don't click them if you're triggered easily.

Please ask more questions if you have any. So in short not against porn but against abuse in porn. In short: against mainstream porn. Not against the idea of two consenting, respectful adults filming themselves having sex and others watching it.  The links you posted are not "mainstream" porn. It's a big enough portion of porn for there to be tens of thousands of those videos. If not more.  I didn't say there aren't.  But to call those mainstream is disingenuous.  That's all I was saying.  That's not what the majority of people watching porn want to watch, even if the numbers watching those videos is huge.  That doesn't make it the norm or mainstream.  As someone else pointed out, check the most popular NSFW subreddits for evidence.

Btw, I'm not trying to disprove any of your points that you've made, just pointing out that it would help if you didn't use misleading terms.</snippet></document><document><title>E TV, Rihanna, and Chris Brown. Celebrity, Media, and Domestic Violence</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18clqx/e_tv_rihanna_and_chris_brown_celebrity_media_and/</url><snippet>This is just a rant.

I understand that it must be difficult for people like Rihanna, to constantly have their lives on the news 24/7. It must be especially difficult following an abusive relationship and constantly having people judge your moves. 

But media is a strong influencer of behaviors and acceptance of behaviors. I may be more inclined then the average person to judge media for things like objectification because of my field of interest and work, but maybe not. I think every person should be just as outraged as me. It is the responsibility of E TV and Rihanna to bring awareness to domestic violence and how it really works. Instead, they paraded around Rihanna and Chris Brown as a reunited cute couple. Women in abusive relationships are going to see this couple and think that men can change and that their relationship will get better or is okay because for Rihanna it is. Some men do change, but it is a much, much smaller percentage than the ones who continue to be abusive. 

I am deeply saddened when I think out how many women will be negatively influenced by this. Rihanna herself should be advocating for women to get out of abusive relationships. All she is showing is the emotional vulnerability of women who are abused.   It bugs me that people keep expecting Rihanna to be some spokeswoman for domestic abuse when it is something she is clearly still grappling with herself. Beyond the celebrity she is still human, meaning she is going to go through much of the same stuff that anyone that has been in an abusive relationship has been in, and more than anything, if she is getting out of an abusive relationship (which she should be doing, certainly) she should be doing it for herself, as anything less than that would make the likelihood of her going back higher, in my opinion.

How the media handles it all is a different story, though. There is plenty of opportunity there to invite spokespersons of domestic violence on to talk about it in a mature and balanced way, including numbers for people to call if they feel that they are in an abusive relationship. Pretty much anything would be better than turning a blind eye, which is what it looks like segments of the media is currently doing. Which is why I said it is hard for her to be in the public and to be judged. But as a celebrity you know you are going to be a role model to many. But as far as I can tell she hasn't acknowledged anything regarding the relationship as being abusive. She could, if she was happy with the relationship if Chris Brown really changed, say that not all relationships end up like hers. That most of the time, the relationship will remain abusive. My main issue is with the media, they shouldn't be taking a lighthearted approach to it at all. </snippet></document><document><title>little girl gets it right.</title><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=tyUFnQlaN7Q</url><snippet>      I'm pretty psyched as well to hear her (dad?) encouraging her gender-equal rant.  </snippet></document><document><title>Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue Reaches Out to Female Readers With... </title><url>http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/02/11/sports_illustrated_swimsuit_issue_magazine_reaches_out_to_women_with_tips.html</url><snippet>   Lame!

My mother, being fairly conservative, didn't let me wear much other than lip gloss. 

About the time everyone else started wearing makeup (7th grade, age 12) I realized that they all changed around the time they began wearing makeup. My best friend, a level-headed and sweet nerdy girl, became completely obnoxious and her grades began to drop. 

I was terrified of makeup now. I didn't want to become something I wasn't which is pretty much the entire point of makeup (kinda). 

I also didn't realize that everyone who didn't have raccoon eyes was wearing makeup too and began to have unrealistic ideals for what I should look like, sending me into a self-conscious and unhappy state. 

In about 8th grade my mom decided that I should "wear a little makeup every day" and I resisted with all my might. I remember her saying "you are not God's gift to the world, go put on some makeup!"

When people ask me why I don't wear makeup I lie and say that I'm just to lazy or that I don't really care. In reality, I really do care. I want to look pretty and I know I can without makeup but it works a whole lot better with. 

I guess my real question is how do I overcome my fears of becoming something I'm not and accept makeup as a good thing?     I think first and foremost we as people need to realize that feeling 'pretty' is something that happens as a result of self-esteem and confidence boosting, not make up; so many of us are confused on this point because of what we're conditioned and encouraged to think about our appearances through unrealistic beauty standards. 

That said, make up is a way of feeling beautiful, but it's not a crutch. You don't have to think you're ugly to wear it - it's no different than throwing on a necklace or a scarf - it's an accent to what you already have. At the end of the day, it all washes off - no matter how much you put on or who you pretend to be.

My advice is to start slowly and try what you're comfortable with. Play up a single feature to start with - maybe try a tinted lip-balm or a natural looking mascara for starters - or some soft neutral shadows. Then if you're still interested, feel free to pursue some bright colours, or even just wear a smoky eye for the hell of it. 

I wear a bright lipstick out to cheer myself up because the colour literally brightens up your face, and the happiness is contagious. Make up can be very empowering even when just used on occasion or very lightly. I'm sure you'll find the balance that works for you - you just have to give it a try. :) Thank you. Thank you a lot.  </snippet></document><document><title>Question about crying</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bxyp/question_about_crying/</url><snippet>Hey people of twoX!  
I'm sure you guys can help me out or at least offer some sympathy with my problem.... I cry too quickly. I don't mean I'm sad or upset too easily. I just instantly have to cry whenever I bring up something that's important to me to someone who is important to me. No matter if that person is my mom, my boss, my best friend or my SO. Whenever something bothers me and I work up courage to address it I have to cry as soon as I go for it. It's often unsettling to people because (obviously) creates the impression that I'm very hurt or upset and that they "made me cry", even though that's not the case more often than it is.  
My SO even once said that he felt bad he makes me cry so often although he's super lovely and actually never makes me cry at all, I just cry super easily, it's enough to be a little nervous about something!  
I would really like to do something as I feel like it doesn't really reflect the way how I feel in those moments and it sends out vibes that I don't inted to send out.  
To clarify, I don't think that there's anything wrong with crying when hurt, or upset, or confused, or angry, whathaveyou. I just think I cry to easily when I don't even feel like crying. It feels like a purely physical reaction that keeps me from having the communication that I want to have. As far as I can remember it has always been this way.  
Are you experiencing this? Has anybody found a way of dealing? Right now I go with just letting it flow as it seems like fighting it only makes it worse...  I have this same issue and I know a couple of other people (including one man!) who have it too.

First off, it's okay to be emotional. Don't let anyone fault you for that. My dad would always get really frustrated when I'd start crying any time we had a serious talk and I thought that I was weak or wrong for crying. Really, it's just a physical response to emotion or stress.

I wish I had a good way of avoiding crying at inopportune moments but I really don't. However, the way I deal with it is by telling anyone who's experiencing my insta-crying "please don't pay attention to the fact that I am crying. It's a physiological response and I can't control it. I am not sad or upset, I just feel strongly about what we're discussing and my instinctive response is to cry." Then I move on and try to have the discussion without letting my involuntary crying bother me too much.   Haha, I was thinking of asking something similar to this yesterday. 

As much as I would love to offer you advice, I am in the same boat. I've always cried at the drop of a hat. Scared, angry, sad, happy - tears everywhere! 

It's only recently that I started thinking how other people might interpret it wrongly. My boss told me (I started crying when I was getting 'critiqued') it 'doesn't do anything for him' and it made me appear 'unstable'. Sigh.

Nice to know I'm not on my own. Hope you get some useful responses :)  Are you on the birth control pill or any other hormones? 

Just curious, not that you'd necessarily have to be on hormones to experience lots of crying. Just thinking that's an easy diagnosis and potential fix.   I don't know why but I cry only for the little things. I see a movie and end up crying but when something major happens I never feel like it. It's pretty strange.  I have had the same issue for as long as I can remember. It has gotten better as I've gotten older (I'm currently 32), but I do still have to deal with it from time to time. I think the main reason it has gotten better is that experience has taught me that many of the things I thought were so important really weren't that important. Also, I can feel it coming on and will sometimes excuse myself, go to the bathroom and calm myself down. As some other commenters have suggested, it helps to change or control your thoughts.   I cry when I'm frustrated, especially when I can't form the words to explain something important (defending myself or my position on something). It always makes people uncomfortable, so I have to tell them it's just a reaction I have and to ignore it. Thankfully it's just tears streaming out of my eyes, and not total sobbing. Haha lucky you, my speech gets inhibited. Not really sobbing but it's very unnerving :P It happens even when I know exactly what I'm gonna say. I had a talk with my SO the other day that was completely benevolent. I wrote down notes to make sure I wont forget anything important and I still had to cry! It really weirds me out.</snippet></document><document><title>Geena Davis on gender roles in the media- her solution to the problem</title><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULFaVdHGT38</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Anyone had Mirena removed because of emotional issues and/or anxiety?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cil8/anyone_had_mirena_removed_because_of_emotional/</url><snippet>I just got my Mirena taken out after 6 months on Thursday after months of mood swings, crying spells, and anxiety. I was wondering if anyone here experienced something similar and can let me know what to expect, how long it may take for my body to get readjusted, and whether those issues went away after removal (specifically anxiety and crying) for you all. Thanks! :)   I had a similar issue when I switched to the patch (ortho-evra) because I thought it would be easier.  It was easier, but it also made me a crazy person.  I think the issues evaporated pretty quickly- maybe after my next period?  It sucks that you invested the effort into an IUD and it didn't work out.  Maybe you should try a non-hormonal?  In any case, good luck with your next method.  That's EXACTLY what happened to me on Mirena, and I had mine removed after 6 months too! I felt much better within a month, but still had the occasional meltdown, and it was a few months more before I felt like I was back to 100% myself. I feel your pain. I hope you feel like yourself soon! Thank you, this is so helpful! I keep worrying that things aren't going to get better, but I have to keep reminding myself that it takes time for hormones to totally cycle out. I already feel a wee bit better and I know I'll be back to my normal self before I know it. By a few months more, do you mean 2? 3? I just want to know what to expect. Thank you so much! I'd estimate for sure within 6, but the moments of irrational anxiety got fewer and farther between with time. I'm a person who has some tendencies toward anxiety to begin with, but the Mirena-induced anxiety felt different - more overpowering and extra irrational. I gradually got back to my usual level of anxiety. :)

To answer your other question, I am back on the pill, which I had been on for four years prior to Mirena and which does not make me feel the same anxiety. The pill I use is Lutera, which is one of the lowest dose combined ones available.

I considered Paragard, and am still considering Paragard, but I have a nickel sensitivity and am concerned about the possibility for an adverse reaction if any part of the nickel core (under the copper wire) is exposed. If I lived in Canada, where the non-hormonal IUDs have a silver core instead of nickel, I'd get one in a heartbeat! That's EXACTLY what happened to me on Mirena, and I had mine removed after 6 months too! I felt much better within a month, but still had the occasional meltdown, and it was a few months more before I felt like I was back to 100% myself. I feel your pain.

Might be a tad trivial to some, but I'm at my wit's end.</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bsyl/how_do_i_cope_with_this_office_situation_might_be/</url><snippet>I am at my absolute wit&#8217;s end with a coworker of mine, and need a place to vent and hopefully get some advice. There may be a more appropriate subreddit for this issue, but I&#8217;ve always loved TwoX and have observed that many top-notch advice-givers live here. :) I apologize for the wall of text, but I just can&#8217;t bear to leave anything out!

Let&#8217;s call her Trudy.  And let me also start by saying that Trudy is a lovely human being, a sweetheart, and has a great work ethic. She works hard and tries her best. Personally, I find her delightful if a bit sheltered. She brings me egg mcmuffins for breakfast sometimes, and I bring her new lattes during the holidays as she had never tried starbucks before working with me.  We&#8217;ve gone to lunch once or twice and had a nice time. Trudy has worked here for 13 years. I came on board last Spring 2012. We share the same job title and basically work as admins/paper-pushers at a large university. Good old state job.

So what&#8217;s the problem? Unfortunately, Trudy is one of the most unqualified people I&#8217;ve EVER worked with. Her comprehension skills (both written and aural) are abysmally, devastatingly poor.  She cannot learn new processes to save her life. TO SAVE HER LIFE.


A list, off the top of my head, of shit Trudy consistently CANNOT do- I have chosen the word CANNOT carefully, because I have lost track of how many times I have patiently trained her how to do these:


* She cannot attach a document to an email. I have to walk her through this 100%, no exaggeration. She has never successfully attached a document without my help. 


* She cannot copy and paste text if the formatting doesn&#8217;t already match EXACTLY. You can always tell which document/record was her doing because of all the mixed font styles and sizes with weird spacing.


* She cannot add or edit a signature in an outlook email.


* She cannot look up (google) the spelling of a foreign country. We send out a lot of mail in our office. We continuously get mail back because she fucked up the spelling so bad or even left the country off altogether. 


I will repeat in case you missed it earlier: We are ADMINS. We deal with this kind of work EVERY GODDAMN DAY. Often it feels like half my workload involves walking her through the same shit or covering for and correcting her numerous and inevitable mistakes.


Additionally, Trudy is NOT the near-sighted granny with Alzheimer&#8217;s that you all must be picturing by now. She&#8217;s late 40s early 50s, healthy, alert, and cheerful.


I have already brought this up with our boss (I was much more tactful and professional about it, to be sure).  I explained that a large percentage of my day is spent helping her, and while I don&#8217;t mind helping, I am concerned that my own work could suffer because of how much time I dedicate to her. I had this sit-down with her 2 months after starting this position. My boss thanked me for my input, and since then, nothing has changed. I'm reluctant to bring it up again because I don't want to feel like a nag/tattletale.


I don&#8217;t know what to do. We&#8217;re supposed to be working as a team, but it feels like my work is doubled by having to double-check (and redo) nearly EVERYTHING that Trudy lays her hands on. And the fact that she&#8217;s so damn SWEET makes it even more complicated. She knows she struggles, she tries, and I just want to hug her, but if I have to watch her eyes glaze over one more time while I try to explain these processes as simply as possible, I just might have an aneurysm.


**TL:DR;** Colleague is unqualified and cannot perform the basic functions of a job that she has been at for 13 years, and I have to pick up the slack. Boss doesn&#8217;t seem to care. Help!
  Tell her that you'll help her once you get all your work done first so that you won't suffer. Sometimes you have to let a person fall before they can do something on their own and if she fails, that's not on you. In this age, the things she can not do are a huge hindrance so either she'll be forced to learn or she'll get fired. It sucks, it really does, but this isn't your problem or job to do.  Can you document the process in paper form? Type the instructions step by step, print it out, and have it ready to hand to her the next time she asks. She might not be able to comprehend when you show her or tell her how to do things, but it might work if she has something to look at and hold.

My mom is like this, so I've had to make user's guides for the TV remote and features. Of course, she consistently loses the print-outs, so... Can you document the process in paper form?

Thanks! I would believe it because she sounds just like my mom. (Who is also only 50.) And after about 10 years, my mom still can't do anything I teach her on the computer. I think for some people they'll just *never* get it. 

My advice: whatever route you decide to take with this issue, take it from the POV that she'll *never* learn.    It sounds like she has a learning disability.  Your bosses probably already know about the issue and keep her on because she isn't causing any terrible issues, the worst being returned mail because of bad addresses.

You probably are there to double-check Trudy.  As humans, part of our society is to help out the underdogs, and really it's probably more of a service to her to have this job.  What else could she do?  Does she have family who could support her without it?  Where would she go?

Sometimes people don't have jobs because they are the best at it, but because their employers realize that they would be lost without it.    </snippet></document><document><title>Called "selfish" for not having children</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/189pz9/called_selfish_for_not_having_children/</url><snippet>I'm a 42 year old woman and I recently had an IUD put in, which should take care of my reproductive birth control needs until menopause. I am personally very excited about this, and I am very comfortable knowing I never had kids. I am total peace with myself and my choices all along the way. Being so happy, I shared this news in a more appropriate form on facebook. 

Well, my distant cousin found it her place to call me selfish and THEN said I probably would have been a bad parent anyway, so all for the best. This has really upset me, because although I have indeed made choices, not all choices have been mine alone. I've never married and I never wanted children out of wedlock. It's not like I've been living the high life here, I've had some serious turmoil in my life and I am glad I never subjected a child to that insanity. And who cares if I jetset around the world ? I've no obligation to GAWD to procreate.

I just wish these old bitch dinosaurs would die and let women (and men) make choices for themselves as they see fit.

No, but some of my child free friends get quite obnoxious about how awful kids are and how they can't imagine anyone wanting to have them. Not all, but some.

I once had a relative hint that I wasn't a real woman unless I had a child (I had been married a few years at this point) to which I replied "any animal can reproduce" and walked away. She never bothered me again. Holy crap, the things people say! I was on the receiving end of a similar conversation, only it was with a perfect stranger. She started by asking if I'd had kids, then went on to say women aren't 'complete' until they have them. Felt like a neverending speech, and it left me feeling down.

Anyway, I wish I'd known to respond as you did, lol! I'll keep it in mind should the need arise. Think of the repeated abuse my husband and I took when we decided to finally have a baby after 10 years of marriage! I even told one insufferable person that we were probably "not doing it right" just to shock them in to shutting up. Heh. My husband just tells people that we don't breed well in captivity. I once had a relative hint that I wasn't a real woman unless I had a child (I had been married a few years at this point) to which I replied "any animal can reproduce" and walked away. She never bothered me again. Ooh la la!  'Not a real woman'?  Nice!
I was called 'unnatural' for not having/wanting to have kids.
Love how my life choices are apparently everyone's business... actually, now that I think about it, none of the people who have given me shit for my choices have really been anyone I like or respect, anyway...

 Those pandas around the world who don't feel like reproducing must be artificial as shit. Natural =/= feeling like reproducing.  I once had a relative hint that I wasn't a real woman unless I had a child (I had been married a few years at this point) to which I replied "any animal can reproduce" and walked away. She never bothered me again. I heard something similar in relation to my career. Apparently I'm not doing my duty to womankind by having a child and essentially nuking my career, and I should be ashamed of myself for not standing with all the other career women who take a hit to their ambitions to have babies.

I once had a relative hint that I wasn't a real woman unless I had a child (I had been married a few years at this point) to which I replied "any animal can reproduce" and walked away. She never bothered me again. That is genius. I'm saving that reply up for next Christmas!   I am a new first time mum- but I never have, and still don't understand- "selfish" to who exactly? In order to be be selfish, doesn't than mean you act according to your own wishes, at the detriment to someone else's wishes? I don't get this stupid argument I'm kind of baffled by this argument myself. I would assume that people mean that they think you are selfish for not wanting to have to care for a potential child/ bring a life into the world if they use this argument. But if that's the case, isn't it a little arbitrary to draw the "selfish" line at just one or two children, when people can potentially keep getting pregnant and giving birth to new life? Isn't it still selfish to a couple's potential third child if they decide to stop having children after two? 

The whole thing sounds ridiculous because it is. You said it best: how can it be selfish if it is not a "detriment to someone else's wishes"? After all, there are no actual living, breathing children involved in the choice to never have children or to only have one or two children. Only potential, imaginary children that couldn't possibly have wishes of their own, since they don't exist...      You should hear what people say to those that have one kid and have decided not to have anymore.  The same damn thing.  [deleted] You should hear what people say to those that have one kid and have decided not to have anymore.  The same damn thing.  No. Fucking. Joke.

I can't count how many times people have asked me "When are you going to have another one?" Then when I respond "Oh one and done for me :)" they say "You'll change your mind."

My child is 9. You think I'll change my mind now when I haven't for the past nine years? No way I'm resetting that 18 year clock!  Tell your cousin that she should mind her own business and work on her own problems instead of attacking other people over their lives.   Meh, almost everything people do can be called "selfish" by somebody's standards. Eat meat? Selfish. Drive a car that pollutes the environment? Selfish. Buy nice little things for yourself instead of donating your entire net worth? Selfish. But so what? People have their priorities, and children are not one of yours. Your distant cousin is an ass for judging you like that.  [deleted] I have that inner battle as well. If I decide I want kids (I'm still on the fence), then I'd want biological kids with my SO. Because I'm selfish and I want them to look like us so I can say, "Oh look, he's got his daddy's nose and his mommy's eyes!" There's already too many people on this earth, many of whom are children who need loving homes, and here I might want to pop out a few more just so they look similar. It makes me feel like a bit of a bitch. 

But of course, I'd never demonize anyone else who decided to have biological kids over adopting, as that was their choice. Gah, see, this is why I'm still undecided and why I don't have kids yet.  I have that inner battle as well. If I decide I want kids (I'm still on the fence), then I'd want biological kids with my SO.

But of course, I'd never demonize anyone else who decided to have biological kids over adopting, as that was their choice. Gah, see, this is why I'm still undecided and why I don't have kids yet.  I really identify with this. 

I often think I would like to have one biological child, as I really want the experience of pregnancy and birth. 

Ideally I would like to then adopt all the brothers and sisters. 

I would love to have five biological children but that just doesn't seem ethical to put that extra strain on the planet.  Raise them well to contribute to a society in which everyone has a smaller footprint.  Who knows, maybe one of them will perfect the Thorium reactor? That doesn't change the fact that instead of giving birth she could have adopted kids from Africa who might not otherwise ever have a chance to try perfecting the thorium reactor. so what, though. It's about choices. Having kids vs. adopting doesn't mean one choice is "better". It's just about what works for you as a family and a parent. If you want to have 5 or even ten kids and you really truly and honestly believe you can handle it, then do it. Raise 10 kids to be fucking awesome little people who grow up and do good in the world, whether they came from your body or someone else's.

Maybe it will balance out the 10 kids who will grow up to be awful people. 

It's not selfish to want to have children if you provide for them and be the best parent you can be &amp;gt; Maybe it will balance out the 10 kids who will grow up to be awful people. 

That makes absolutely no sense. 

typoidmaree appears to feel the same way as I do (although she/he cites environment, and I was referring to social equality). We see that we could either adopt or have children, and whether we have children or not, those children we could have adopted will still exist, and that constitutes an ethical trade-off. Everybody has to decide for themselves how they will deal with it, but don't muddy the waters and pretend that that ethical trade-off doesn't exist. It does.  Not really. Nothing is that black and white or simple. You can't just say "either I have 10 kids or adopt 10 kids" and have it be more positive. What if the 10 kids you have from your body end up being scientists that cure cancer and finally develop clean energy, and the adopted kids end up being drug addicts and criminals?  

How do you know you could adopt that many kids? How do you know adopting simply wouldn't work for you? What if you are the kind of person that deep down wants biological children but make the choice to adopt because you somehow feel guilty? Is that the right reason to have a child?

It's not a trade off so much as it is just a choice. There is no inherent 'wrong' in reproducing. There is nothing "better" about adopting a child vs. having your own. It's just different. It just is a different choice. You don't get special awards or congratulations or sainthood or anything because you chose to adopt rather than have bio children. It just makes you a parent either way. There's no 'ethical trade-off' because there is no ethical dilemma. 

If you want to be a parent you either adopt or you have biological children but neither one of them is more ethical or right or good or moral or anything. It's simply a different option. I have that inner battle as well. If I decide I want kids (I'm still on the fence), then I'd want biological kids with my SO. Because I'm selfish and I want them to look like us so I can say, "Oh look, he's got his daddy's nose and his mommy's eyes!"

[deleted] [deleted] Over-population is a problem in developing countries. Most developed countries have shrinking populations that they have to supplement with immigration. The best way to reduce over-population is increase the standards of living in developing countries. You having less children doesn't do anything to help that, and instead it *worsens* the problem since it negatively impacts the economy, which in our globalized world negatively impacts economies everywhere else, too. By having less children it decreases the number of potential skilled, educated workers who can contribute positively to the world in the next generation while people who need support and assistance continue to increase. 

So yeah, you shouldn't feel selfish.

EDIT: I think some people might be upset at my choice of words as far as designating developed countries as having more skilled, educated workers to contribute to global research and development. I wanted to clarify that this is a discussion of economics: statistics and trends on a macro-level, and not a reflection of the value of people as human beings. Living in an developing country doesn't make you less intelligent or reduce your potential to contribute--it reduces your ability since you are limited by your environment. To be fair, people in "first-world" countries will use *significantly* more resources than those in "developing" countries, which exacerbates the environmental problems already present. I am not necessarily suggesting that people should not have children for this reason, but it's not as simple as you claim.  That's because everyone always ignores the other massive part of the problem, which is over consumption.  To be fair, people in "first-world" countries will use *significantly* more resources than those in "developing" countries, which exacerbates the environmental problems already present. I am not necessarily suggesting that people should not have children for this reason, but it's not as simple as you claim.  And they're also much more likely to make the scientific and technological breakthroughs needed to solve those issues. Resources will run out eventually one way or the other. I'd rather have more people working toward advancement than purely delaying the inevitable. There are many assumptions in what you've said here, some of which seem rather elitist and irrelevant. Anyway, I never implied that the glorious and productive first-world problem solvers should not have kids. I meant to imply that selfishness is relative.  I don't see how anything I said was irrelevant or elitist since I addressed exactly what you said. And you didn't even mention selfishness or relativity in your post. The main point you seemed to make was that the issue is a lot more complicated than it seems. Can you tell me how I mistook that for your point of selfishness being relative? Pardon the snark.

I simply think that it's problematic to try to justify reproduction in first-world countries by saying that it's okay because we are more likely to fix the horrible environmental problems that *we continue to cause.* In my first post, I was trying to communicate (ineffectively, it seems) that I think you'd oversimplified a really complicated global social issue, that's all. 

To be sure, my personal belief is that reproduction is a fundamental human right that supersedes any potential environmental outcomes. However, it does not make much sense to me, especially when considering the "macro" scale, to say that someone should not feel guilty about having a kid because of a infinitesimal chance that his or her child will solve all of the world's problems and/or be a producer-consumer in an economy that holds a great deal of responsibility for them in the first place. If you want to make it an equation, I find it hard to believe that one child's "value added" can make up for his or her lifetime carbon footprint. That being said, one should not have to justify having a child in the first place, and should never feel guilty for it. Not because of any economic or environmental consideration, but because being a parent is part of the human experience that people should have the right to take part in if they so choose.

So basically, we agree, just for different reasons.  Over-population is a problem in developing countries. Most developed countries have shrinking populations that they have to supplement with immigration. The best way to reduce over-population is increase the standards of living in developing countries. You having less children doesn't do anything to help that, and instead it *worsens* the problem since it negatively impacts the economy, which in our globalized world negatively impacts economies everywhere else, too. By having less children it decreases the number of potential skilled, educated workers who can contribute positively to the world in the next generation while people who need support and assistance continue to increase. 

So yeah, you shouldn't feel selfish.

Living in an developing country doesn't make you less intelligent or reduce your potential to contribute--it reduces your ability since you are limited by your environment. Right on.  If people in developed countries don't start having more babies and soon, all those countries will collapse, leading to a deep worldwide depression that could last for centuries.  Japan won't exist (as we know it) in 75 years.  Many of the countries of Europe are in the same boat. 

It's not that people in developing countries are not capable of leading the world (and you never said that, despite what some of your replies seem to think), but the population collapse in developed countries will cause problems that will ripple through the whole world.  We'll see it in our lifetimes.   

TL;DR: People in developed countries--it's a-ok to keep popping out babies.   [deleted] [deleted] Well, rationalize it this way: you'd be educating your child(ren?) to be aware of overpopulation and how to create less impact.... Passing on the knowledge, so that she/he/they can be a voice amongst her/his/their peers.

Gah... Pronoun overpopulation... What? Sorry I'm seriously confused as to how this is a rationalization. Take part in overpopulation...so you can educate against it...seems legit.

How about educating people that already exist instead of telling your future offspring "Hey guise, see, I had you, but it's probably best if you didn't reproduce." Well, rationalize it this way: you'd be educating your child(ren?) to be aware of overpopulation and how to create less impact....

I am selfish, I don't have nor want kids. It is a selfish choice. 

You are selfish too...but, that's not bad. 

Selfish has a negative connotation when it shouldn't. You had YOU to take care of. YOU weren't ready. YOU have dreams that don't involve children. YOU get to be free from the hassle of children. YOU have chosen to live for YOU as well you should. That is inherently selfish. But you are not bad nor wrong for making your choices. 

You knew what you wanted and you stuck by that. That is good. 

I think no matter our choices, most of us make most of our choices based on our wants and needs. That is selfish...but that's ok. 

Both choices...having kids or not having kids are also not selfish. A parent now has to put another life before their own. You were unselfish by not having a child you weren't ready for...no matter the reasons. 

You made the best choice for you and it sounds like you know it and accept it, so good for you. Some people just cannot be happy for people that take a different road. Don't let it get you down. 

Embrace your selfishness and see it as a positive, you are leading a better life for YOU based on your values by making those choices that were best for you. If making a choice for yourself based on what is best for you - a choice that will *not* hurt anyone else in any way - is selfish, then ALL people in the entire world are selfish. But if we're all selfish, then "selfish" isn't really anything.

What "selfish" actually is is making a choice that benefits you *at the expense* of other people. And choosing not to have kids isn't that. It isn't selfish.  If making a choice for yourself based on what is best for you - a choice that will *not* hurt anyone else in any way - is selfish, then ALL people in the entire world are selfish.

People share personal things on Facebook. If it's "unacceptable" to say you're happy about your lack of reproduction, it's equally unacceptable to post that you got pregnant, got married, or made a business promotion.

Yet, this is pretty much exactly what Facebook does.

If you can't post personal stuff, you might as well not do status updates.

Adding to that, distant relatives are usually people who are only on the friend list out of politeness. If you have a cousin that you see once every two years at a family dinner, you probably shouldn't be making statement about her choices anyway, even if you are on her Facebook.  Fuck those people. *But don't get pregnant, hue hue hue.*

That really sucks! There's a sub for childless couples/people, pretty sure it's /r/childfree. I feel ya, though, but I'm young enough that I keep getting all the "oh, you'll change your mind" line coupled with the knowing wink/head nod.

I fucking hate *(the responsibility that comes with)* kids. I'm not gonna have any little (~~bastards~~ *bundles of blissful joy*) running around my house *(and into sharp things I was too lazy to child proof)* any time soon, or later.

*(Edits)* I'm fine with people not wanting to have children, but hating "kids" as a group isn't any better than hating blacks, gays, women, or any other group of people that belong to that group by virtue of birth. Kids are people, and we were all there once. Please consider choosing how you express your desire to be childfree more politely. Alright.

Let's just say you are being selfish, isn't it better to prevent yourself from having a child because of that?

Besides, I don't think you are. I can't imagine how much harder it would be to raise my son on my own. I know there are plenty of single moms who do it everyday, but it has a cost.   People who never assessed their option before going down the road most tread.  Rather than acknowledge that they may not be happy with the decision to marry who they married and have the amount of kids they had when they had, they attack you.  

I am lucky in that most of the females in my family (the one's I admire) say they wouldn't marry if they had to do it over again.  Some did not have kids and they are sooooo happy they didn't.  Some did and love their kids, but would have done it differently. There are the ones similar to your distant cousin, but they are miserable and I would never trade places with them for a minute. 

Plus, you are an adult.  You can be single and child-free as you damn please.                  You should go have a read in /r/childfree ... It can be a little circle jerky at times but its a good subreddit to help keep things in perspective when this sort of thing comes up. 

Everyone in my family treats me like a child (eventhough I'm pushing 30) because I haven't housed someone in my gut locker. I go to /r/childfree when I need some sanity restored after hearing suggestions of me becoming subservient to my breeding sister.                   With overpopulation and dwindling of resources, I actually think that choosing to have kids is the selfish choice.  I feel slightly guilty for wanting kids.                                </snippet></document><document><title>"I was honestly baffled by how many assumptions everyone could come up with about who I was based off of one photo."

And to everyone who felt the best use of their time was to mock a random girl on the internet: Get a hobby. Seriously.  &amp;gt;Apparently I&#8217;m a slutty bitch who borrows her brother&#8217;s Xbox to take photos in an attempt to seduce the men of the internet by feigning interest in gaming.

Because women would never *actually* be interested in gaming, we just want to exploit and prey on (straight) men's sexuality.

Watch out, boys! Here comes the evil succubus, and she's wielding a CONTROLLER!!! The only way to defeat her is to insult her intelligence and tell her to get back in the kitchen! But it isn't a picture of her playing a game, it's a picture of her trying to look sexy with a controller. Those two things are pretty different. I know when I see a picture of a man being sexy, my first instinct is to hate him and everything he does. You're totally not getting it.

The person I was responding to said that people assume that women can never *actually* be into gaming...and I responded saying that it's not as if the girl took a picture of herself actually *playing* any game, it was just her posing with a controller attempting to look sexy. Very different things. The fact that she has an xbox doesn't mean anything? People who just have no interest in gaming own xboxes? Even if that were the case, what is your undeniable evidence that she can't possibly be interested in gaming? You have none, because you don't know this girl. You're still not getting it. Also, how do you know it's *her* Xbox? How do you *know* she plays? All we know know from that picture is that she's trying to look sexy with a controller...which doesn't say anything about her playing or not playing. 

&amp;gt;You have none, because you don't know this girl.

And neither do you...so I could just as easily turn that around. I see your point, and I think that the problem is that there is an automatic assumption that the Xbox doesn't belong to her, with this idea stemming from the fact that she is female. If a male took a picture of himself in a silly pose, holding a controller, not many people would question whether or not he owns or plays games on a console.

Furthermore, this view only strengthens the idea that a girl gamer must validate the fact that she games. She'll be scoffed at and questioned ("What class are you? What level are you? What heroes do you use? Oh, those suck.") if she claims to play anything.

Slowclapping this one out, that's exactly how it is. Goddammit. ~_~

Although, there do exist girls who do propagate the "gamer-girl stereotype," which unfortunately causes it to extend to any girl that is interested in gaming. :( &amp;gt; A guy won&#8217;t doubt another man&#8217;s prowess in gaming, but if a girl says she games, she has to be thoroughly questioned to validate her claim.

"Well, I honestly can&#8217;t blame them. If I saw that photo and didn&#8217;t know any of the context, I would assume the same thing that everyone else did"

I do not know how to take her saying this. All aboard the internalized misogyny train choo chooo.

In the end this article was just her defending her gamer cred and justifying the picture, which makes sense since that's the point of the interview. Unfortunately she ends up reinforcing the bullshit "true gamer" ideology and elitism that taints gaming culture.
 &amp;gt;All aboard the internalized misogyny train choo chooo.

A cruel way to dismiss someones opinion, not only you don't allow her to hold dissenting opinions from yourself but you call her a self-hating woman for doing so. admiral_tuff might've been a little harsh (hey! tuff is in the name!) but part of me was a little disappointed as well. Not to mention the young woman kept referring to her "awkward teenage years" and HOW 'awkward' she was on and on!  There is even one part where she says it (the photo) got really popular when she was 18 and what it was like to be confronted with her "awkward" teen photo... Like two years is so much later!  I'm not trying to hate on her, don't get me wrong, being a girl in that world *is* hard, and I bet if I were her age I'd have responded the same way, attempting to defend and prove my position of authenticity... But admiral_tuff has a really important point and I don't think it's a dissenting opinion from the interviewee, she probably is just unaware! Two years can be a lot of time for some people... &amp;gt;All aboard the internalized misogyny train choo chooo.

A cruel way to dismiss someones opinion, not only you don't allow her to hold dissenting opinions from yourself but you call her a self-hating woman for doing so. No, I definitely got that feeling from the article too. She had a lot of great things to say but a few things still smacked of internalized misogyny. Particularly when asked if it was hard being a female gamer on the internet and she says, quote: 
&amp;gt;The internet is perfectly safe for the smart ones.

So all the women who have issues with men on the internet are not smart? I felt her opinion on female presence on the internet and in gaming is that you're safe as long as you pretend you're not female. Perhaps she is not a self-hating woman, but she is definitely buying in to the idea that being a woman on the internet is bad therefore don't be one.   &amp;gt; Perhaps she is not a self-hating woman, but she is definitely buying in to the idea that being a woman on the internet is bad therefore don't be one.

I don't think that's it, I think she simply was trying to say that it is easier to pretend not to be a female so you don't have to deal with hate or unwanted attention. Sometimes it just gets exhausting defending yourself and you just want to play the game.

I totally enjoy video games, but still, in games where you can go on voice chat (such as CounterStrike: Global Source), I still choose to type instead of talk, just because I don't want any comments made about my gender, and I also don't want to hear bullshit about me being bad because I'm a lady. It's just not relevant. That is true and to be honest I do the same thing. I just think that she takes it a step further by saying that only the 'smart' ones do that. You know what I mean? Maybe it was a poor choice of words on her part but, as it is in the article, there is something faintly misogynistic about it in my opinion.  &amp;gt;All aboard the internalized misogyny train choo chooo.

A cruel way to dismiss someones opinion, not only you don't allow her to hold dissenting opinions from yourself but you call her a self-hating woman for doing so. But what's the opinion in question? 

She said she would probably agree with the people who use this as proof to perpetuate the "girl gamer" stereotype if it weren't her in the picture. So she's saying that she would think someone who takes a suggestive photo with some gamer paraphernalia is a fraud or a slut.

It just bothered me that she's talking about how she hates that she has to justify and prove herself as a real gamer, but would cast the same suspicion on another girl in the same situation. I mean what does context of the photo matter? If it's a joke or a real attempt at seduction, why would you think any less of them for it? &amp;gt;All aboard the internalized misogyny train choo chooo.

It baffles me that anyone would read sexual overtones into her photo.  To me, it just looks like a young woman being silly and pretending to be a cat.  Why does everything involving good-looking young women seem to be &#8220;sexy&#8221;? &amp;gt;It baffles me that anyone would read sexual overtones into her photo.

Easily, to most men when a woman sensually bites something it's a very erotic and an invoking image.  No, I mean, I'm not *surprised* by it&#8212;I don't live under a rock&#8212;I'm just amazed that men's minds seem to so easily sexualize everything.  I'm a lesbian, but without stopping to think about what men like, I wouldn't in a million years find the image erotic.  Playful, yes. Straight woman here. I can immediately tell that it's a playful, erotically-charged picture. She even admits that in her interview.

&amp;gt; My boyfriend at the time was a huge PS3 fan and would take any chance he could to rip on me for having an XBOX. It was a constant source of teasing and it eventually boiled down to me making a joke that I liked my XBOX more than I liked him. 

So she bit the xBox like she would in a sexual way, playfully suggesting she ~loved~ it more than him. No, I mean, I'm not *surprised* by it&#8212;I don't live under a rock&#8212;I'm just amazed that men's minds seem to so easily sexualize everything.  I'm a lesbian, but without stopping to think about what men like, I wouldn't in a million years find the image erotic.  Playful, yes. It's not really fair to accuse only men of doing this. That's equally sexist. I know plenty of gay and straight women who say the same things about girls like this.  I wasn't accusing men of sexism or other poor behavior (it's not as if we can help what we find sexual) so I didn't find it necessary to explicitly nuance my statement.  Of *course* any categorical statement about &#8220;men&#8221; is really a statement about most men and some women, but that's understood.  And in this case, I believe that it is primarily men:  While some women and gay men undoubtedly find this inherently sexual, I suspect that most of them who *say* that sort of thing are reflecting straight men's perception of it.  There are also plenty of straight or bisexual men who don't find this sexy:  I used to be a man&#8212;thank you, twenty-first century&#8212;and I would not have found this anything but silly and nonsexual.

While you're at it, why not point out how my metaphor about living under a rock reflects prejudice against cave-dwellers and is a hasty generalization since plenty of people who don't live under rocks are also ignorant?

Edit:  Syntax issue. Whoa, whoa! I was not trying to accuse of you of anything, and I'm sorry if I came across that way. My apologies-- please don't jump down my throat. I just hear a lot-- even, on occasion, in TwoX--- that men are hypersexual creatures and are always the ones who criticize female gamers, and I have heard lots and lots of women making the same "You're not a REAL gamer" argument.

Why does everything involving good-looking young women seem to be &#8220;sexy&#8221;? See, when I look at it.. I don't even think "cat".  I think "Ew, why the hells you gotta put that cord in your mouth? The Gods knows what that thing's been put into.."  And.. "Wtf is up with this whole.. let's put something in my mouth that shouldn't be and take a photo! thing?"   But, this is probably just my age showing...  lol   

Being a "gamer woman" (I'm too old be be a girl dammit!) I know that we all like our own type of games.  I'm more into the table top roleplaying, and certain MMOs myself.      So who am I to judge this lass on what she plays or dresses, or whatever.  It's just the act of cord in mouth for photo thing that I question. heh Have you found that you get picked on just as much for table-top as a hobby? Outside of my usual circle, I've found that people are incredulous of me RPing. I have to go through every system I've tried, recount some of the more memorable exploits, and assure them that I'm a *real* table-top player. And it's always kids! I'm all, "Dude, I have a decade on you in age, and I've been doing this since I was 8. Keep your trash talk to yourself." I find it completely exhausting.


Tangentially-related, if fantasy is your thing, y'all should give Dungeonworld a try because holycow. If I hadn't found a group of table top players that mostly consists of old friends of mine, I'm sure I never had started it. I play Warhammer and aside the Games Workshop there is no place I'd know to look for other players. At the same time, the GW around here is small and holds pretty much two groups of people: Little boys and 20-something gamer-guys. Little boys are normally interested in playing with the employees or each other. 20-something guys tend to believe, I'm *that* kind of girl, who doesn't know shit about the game and is not interested in it. Why would I go back to that place?  
The only time I got a different attitude was when I participated in a tournament and was accompanied by my BF who took part in it, too. That day the people there were really happy to see me around. At any other time, I was obviously faking it and trying to gain attention.... Uuuugh, gross. I get the same "better" treatment with my husband around. It's a really "damned if you do, damned if you don't" thing. Without him, I'm around to ensnare the mens. Screw the games! With him, I'm clearly in the know because he taught me. I'm also awesome because I support his silly boy hobbies. This is doubly irritating because I introduced him to gaming! Fortunately my friendly local shop doesn't much go for that crap. Even the folks that don't know me tend to be well-behaved and respectful. There's the odd "It's a giiiirl!" gape, but that's mostly younger folks who misplace my age. I got really lucky, I think.

She put a patch on again the very next day. 2 days ago her vagina started being sore. She says it feels like period cramps but she isn't bleeding.

Is this something that could be happening because she might be pregnant? Could it possibly be that she should be starting her period and the patch is making it do something weird? I don't know what it could be, that last one is my guess. Any insight?

I'm in a relationship for 5 years now,  I would say, absolutely we are happy, we rarely fight.  If we get upset it is not usually because of each other.  That being said when he does get upset he gets very upset.  As i mentioned the anger has very rarely been directed at me.  It's usually onset from video games,money problems, or something not working how it should (wrong size phone case bought online, food expired so we cant eat what the planned meal was, etc).

Some reactions to these issues are things like punching a desk, throwing a gaming contoller, throwing his phone, and kicking furniture.  This is the only serious long term relationship i have had so i dont know how normal physical anger is for men.  My dad was the sweetest, mild tempered guy so i cant compare him... and is physical violence, even towards inanimate objects a sign of things that can lead to abuse against me???

I can expect the occasional raised voice "dammit" if you're frustrate, im super easy going, like my dad and i dont get angry much at all.  I'll admit its probably the emotion i deal with the least.  As my family was so calm, i get really scared and worked up when my s.o. gets mad.  One of the more recent times where he slammed a plate in the garbage can left me shaking for an hour, again he wasn't mad at me but all i can think is what happens when i do something wrong?  Its not that i dont make mistakes, but generally he is really loving towards me, but what if i do something that sets him off?

Theres more i can add that complicates things still but I want to ask even outside my relationship, **if someone shows warning of being potentially violent, controlling or anything that scares you to think about abuse what can you do?  Can you suggest anger management?  How do you do so tactfully?  Can you tell them they're scaring you?  What is the borderline/warning sign to leave?**  I don't think my situations hopeless, i certainly dont want to give up, but i do not want to sit back and let things get any worse.  This can apply to spouses, boy/girl friends, bosses, every day friendships, anyone really.

**TLDR: Can you help stop anyone you have a relationship with from developing abusive habits?**  &amp;gt; and is physical violence, even towards inanimate objects a sign of things that can lead to abuse against me???  
  
Yes. This sort of behavior tends to escalate.


Get him to start anger management counseling. Bring it up when he's in a good mood, but make it clear that it's not an option if the relationship is to survive. If he's not willing to take care of his anger issues, get out before it escalates. You deserve to have a partner you're not frightened of. Thanks for the quick response, it sounds like a good place to start.  I just want to be preventative, i really love him and just don't want things to go downhill.  An abusive relationship is a very bad place to be   </snippet></document><document><title>Symptoms are worsening - Candida Diet</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cczm/symptoms_are_worsening_candida_diet/</url><snippet>Hey everybody, I'm looking for some feedback from others who have done the candida diet.  
   

I've cut out as much sugar as I possibly can for the past few days, mainly eating quinoa, veggies, and kefir along with taking garlic, apple cider vinegar, milk thistle and probiotic supplements. I've started taking diflucan again in hopes it might work this time with the combination of the diet. (I took it for a few months awhile back with no success-I was eating a lot of sugar at the time as well though.)   
  
Pretty quick after I started the diet and the diflucan it seems like my yeast infection has gotten worse. I've never experienced much itching with it, mainly just discharge, and right now there's a lot of it and it's very yeasty. On a regular basis when I'm not trying to treat my yeast infection, the discharge is minimal.   
     
If anyone has any ideas on why this may be please let me know!  From what I've read there is not a lot of evidence suggesting this diet actually helps with yeast infections, just that the lack of sugar and white flour eliminates a lot of processed foods, this making you feel better in general. 

Just keep drinking plenty of water, and avoid 'low fat' foods as these tend to contain lots of sugar! I wouldn't try to avoid lots of carbohydrates though as* "this diet may actually contribute to some of the symptoms that yeast syndrome reportedly causes, such as fatigue, lethargy, poor concentration, mood swings, headache, and cravings. (due to lack of carbs)*  (found on everydayhealth.com)  Thanks for the advice! I'm really just trying to stay away from anything high in sugar, since that's apparently what feeds the yeast, and carbohydrates (breads, pastas etc) have a lot of sugars You need some sugars though, otherwise your immune system will be compromised (slightly), thus meaning that your infection could get worse. Nothing wrong in cutting back on carbs and sugars but eliminating them entirely is NOT good for your body.  
Lots of sugar in your diet will not necessarily cause the yeast to multiply faster, sugar in your blood doe not reach the candida in your vagina. Vaginal secretion sugar concentrations do not increase if you have more sugar in your diet.

useful journal article/study 
 I believe I have a systemic candida infection, as I also have oral thrush, bloating, and have been experiencing this for almost a year. Most likely from birth control but I didn't make the proper decision to go off it until I created a huge mess. I've been keeping a log of daily diet with some iPhone app that has all the nutritional values recorded for each food already. I have been getting some sugars, it's unavoidable, but definitely no where near what I used to consume. Did you talk to your doctor about this diet change when you were describer the anti-fungal? As certain foodstuffs may affect how well it works?  Yes, he recommended I cut back on sugar but we both thought it wouldn't be completely necessary as the anti-fungal should work well enough on it;s own, but that wasn't the case and the infection wasn't completely wiped out. This happened to me, too. I'd never had a Candida infection in my life until I went on birth control pills (Azurette). I'm not sure if the birth control is a coincidence.. Now, like you, I believe I have a systemic Candida infection. If I don't take FloraJen3, avoid refined sugar, and take Diflucan, I get yeast infections. After a while, the Diflucan even stopped working, and it's a pretty powerful anti-fungal. I'm also on the Candida Crusher diet. It sounds like it's helped me a lot more than it has you. I'm currently on garlic supplements, FloraJen3, and very little sugar. I used to drink a lot of soda and eat a ton of sweets. I've been drinking Synergy kombucha. When I'm not drinking Kombucha, I'm drinking filtered water. I tried olive leaf extract, but didn't notice much of a difference. I also have chronically elevated liver enzymes, not sure if this is related. I also get UTI's fairly frequently. It seems like if I don't have a UTI, I have a yeast infection. 

Have you tried Greek yogurt, specifically brands like Chobani, Trader Joes, or the more hippieish brands? A lot of brands like Dannon and Yoplait probably put more refined sugar in their brands. I have no evidence to back that up, it's just a guess. I definitely recommend getting the Fooducate app for your phone. That may help a lot in choosing what you buy at the grocery store. It compares different brands and lets you know which ones are better for you by the grading system - A, B, C, D, etc. 

I hope this helps. Good luck to you - this is a really horrible problem to have.  How long have you been battling the candida? Also, while you're taking the supplements and avoiding sugar, is the infection completely gone, or do you think your symptoms are just subsiding? I'm terrified I'll never be able to get rid of these things. :(  My health is somewhat complicated, but I'll try to sum it up. 

Basically, I got viral hepatitis in March 2010. I had been on antibiotics for acne (minocycline) and since I had hep, they'd stopped working, so I stopped taking them. Around this time I also started taking Azurette to help with acne, too. About six weeks later, I started feeling better. I started back on my antiobiotics. 

Suddenly, I start getting yeast infections. This had never happened, and I'd been on antibiotics for at least a year prior to the viral hepatitis. At this point the infections were somewhat random, and not constant, or at least mild enough that I didn't notice. I started FloraJen3, and that worked great. The infections stop. In the past year, I've become less disciplined with probiotics, and they seemed to make less of a difference in stopping an impending infection anyway. During this time, they've been nonstop. Even if they're mild, the yeast is there. I have to take 3-4 FloraJen per day (recommended dose is 1) just to keep them at bay. It gradually gets worse, and at this point it's obviously systemic. I should also mention that I had my first case of oral thrush about a month ago. I'm not sure if the antibiotics caused this, but I tend to think not. The more I read about it, the more I blame my high sugar diet and the birth control I was on.

With the Candida diet, my symptoms have pretty much gone away. My vag is back to normal, and so is my sex drive. I'd been weaning myself off sugar for a few weeks, so it's hard to say if the symptoms subsided gradually or if they've been due to the supplements and religious dieting. I can't say if it's gone for sure, because I haven't been to the doctor. I will report back when I go within the next few weeks.

My advice to you is to gradually wean yourself off sugar before really sticking to the diet. If you're a hardcore sugar addict like I am (and I mean that sincerely, they say the sugar addiction is just as strong as a heroin addiction) then going cold turkey will just make you more likely to cheat on the diet. Here's how I weaned myself:

1 Coke a day for 5 days, down from 2-3 Cokes per day. Then, 1 Coke every 3 days. Then, 1 Coke every 5 days. Substitute water for soda and juice. I found it helpful to infuse my water with fruit, like raspberries, lemon, and strawberries. If you drink Gatorade, switch to SmartWater or G2. 

1/4 box of Snow Caps every 2 days (they're small enough to satisfy my sugar cravings)

Gradually cut out some (not all) of your carbs. Eating a sandwich is fine, but don't make pasta your main meal. Eating protein will curb your appetite in general, which will help lessen your cravings. Stock up on turkey, chicken, and steak. 

I did notice that I started craving saltier foods with this diet. I also have [POTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome) though, so my salt cravings may be due to my low blood pressure. 

I'm happy to help if you need any more advice! Sorry if this is too long.  Depending on what kefir and/or yogurt you're eating, you could still be taking in a ton of sugar. Be sure you're going the cotton panties/no panties route for air flow often and drink a lot of water.  The kefir is plain/natural and no sugar added. </snippet></document><document><title>What do you PMS like?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18bcla/what_do_you_pms_like/</url><snippet>I've been putting two and two together, it took me roughly a decade of menstruating to finally realise that some things I feel and due are most probably due to PMS. 
I start eating like a horse, get moody sometimes, get all ice-queen on my boyfriend. Well, what a girl with a very healthy PMS to do! 

What's it like for you? How do you quell your moodyness? I tend to try to ignore people so I don't flare up.   One week before my period, I eat like crazy. It's unbelievable, I could eat all day and I never feel full and I'm horny all the time. I don't have any mood changes though. This is the same thing that happens to me. I literally become a food vacuum. I often out-eat my boyfriend who's twice my size.

It's pretty awesome. One week before my period, I eat like crazy. It's unbelievable, I could eat all day and I never feel full and I'm horny all the time. I don't have any mood changes though.  I'm irritable and angry.  I hate everyone and everything and the whole world can go to hell.

My breasts seem to be irritable as well.  They're become super sensitive and painful.  

I am now a black hole and must consume, that is my purpose.

Sex!  I need it and I need it now!  Sometimes several times a day.

Life has no meaning and everyone hates me.  I am the saddest person in the world and must commiserate my sadness by watching the saddest movies.

I am now aware that tiny goblins are grabbing my insides and punching me with brass knuckles...with spikes.  They also seem to have inflated a hot air balloon in my abdomen causing immense pressure throughout.  

The goblins' hot air balloon is leaking air...through an exit orifice...they're also dumping waste through said orifice.  The bathroom is my sanctuary.

Then it goes away for a bit just to come back again.  Hormonal birth control doesn't help either.  It actually makes me feel crazy all the time.  I tend to live in my yoga pants and sweatshirts.  Nap times are the best times and my puppy lays across my stomach as my little space heater.  Worst part is my SO gets sympathy PMS sometimes haha. I'm irritable and angry.  I hate everyone and everything and the whole world can go to hell.

Nap times are the best times and my puppy lays across my stomach as my little space heater.  Worst part is my SO gets sympathy PMS sometimes haha.  All these comments are so reassuring... Sometimes I feel like I get a bit crazy with PMS. In addition to (possibly all) these symptoms mentioned, my boobs go up a cup size and are painfully sore. I am horrendously mucus-sy Down There. Oh my yes!  Before I started taking BC, my boobs would grow so fast and painfully that I would sprout bruises from the inside.  I'm already quite chesty, but on those days my boobs were HUGE and rock hard and so, so painful.

I love birth control. That's interesting... BC doesn't have any effect on my boobs, though I get extremely extended periods. I'm on Implanon though.  Good lord, *extended* periods?  Have you tried a low-estrogen BC?  Everything changed when I went onto Alesse.  My boobs calmed right down. All these comments are so reassuring... Sometimes I feel like I get a bit crazy with PMS. In addition to (possibly all) these symptoms mentioned, my boobs go up a cup size and are painfully sore. I am horrendously mucus-sy Down There.        I get angry.  Brain-meltingly angry.  So mad, at everyone and everything.  And then I get sad, because I didn't mean to be so mean!  I just wanted the world to know that I hate them!  Oh shame on me.

And hungry!  For the week before the onset of nature's present, I eat everything I can get my greasy mitts on.

And then, a couple days before it starts until after the first day, I am in PAIN in my guts.  I have to poop constantly, I get rolling cramps that make my knees hurt, and that eating thing is not helping anything at this point.  So I'm lazy, in pain, and everyone is mad at me.

To combat this monthly shitstorm, I take hormonal birth control.  I'm in fact looking into permanent birth control, but because I NEED the hormone balance, I'm sticking with an IUD.

I've learned to teach myself mantras when I'm getting angry.  When I'm pissed at my boyfriend, I go to my room and remind myself of what I call the First Principle Of Our Relationship:  He wouldn't intentionally hurt me.  So if he did something wrong, it's unintentional.  And I have to know that it might just be PMS.  Do some math in my head, carry the two, oh my, yes.  It's PMS.  So calm down.

Anyway, YMMV with hormonal BC, but it's saved my ass from being a crazy nutjob.  Not everybody becomes a crazy nutjob, of course, but I sure do.

Just try to track what makes you feel better.  Hot water bottles and ice cream are also very, *very* therapeutic. ;) These mantras may be a good idea for me too. For I Know in my head that it's just me and the things he does wouldn't piss me off usually - but today's a special time and he better get out of my way! 

Keeping it all bottled up may not be the best thing though, but it keeps the relationship safer.  I get angry.  Brain-meltingly angry.  So mad, at everyone and everything.  And then I get sad, because I didn't mean to be so mean!  I just wanted the world to know that I hate them!  Oh shame on me.

Hot water bottles and ice cream are also very, *very* therapeutic. ;) Have you ever met one of those guys (I don't think there are very many, but they exist) who says "You'll never understand how horrible it is to have to deal with a woman on her period. You guys have it so easy."

I don't think they're doing it to be mean, but jesus christ it can get annoying.  I just...get my PMS. And...eat a little more. And take ibuprofin. And get pimples? 

I've never noticed a huge difference in my behaviour though....Been menstruating for 9 years. You should put that on your resume.

"Hmm, mmhmm, hmm...Oh! I see here that you've been menstruating for.. 9 years? My, that's a long time. Nice to see. Great stuff here, just some great stuff."    I always eat like a horse one week before my period. Honestly, I just eat and eat until there is nothing left in the house, then I have to trudge out to the shops and get some more food. Repeat cycle for 3-5 days. 

When I am actually on, I just get bad mood swings and bloat out quite badly.   I get that too! Except that I can also call and get the delicious pizzas delivered straight to me. It's nasty, why can't I have an appetite for vegetables?     The day before and throughout my period (only about 3 days) I tend to get very frustrated very easily with my boyfriend, which I always feel bad about...but I can't help it! I just feel so much more emotionally sensitive. Everything I have to do (homework, cooking, etc.) becomes so much more difficult and I'm terrible at everything and I'll be a failure. My legs (from my ass to my knees) ache terribly and I get really painful lower abdominal cramps. Finally, I have an insatiable craving for Raisinets.

Edit: I forgot the bloating, OH THE BLOATING. Everything looks terrible. My hair feels frizzy and greasy and ugly, my skin feels weird, my eyes look dull, my love handles grow what seems to be three times their normal size. I want to crawl back into bed as soon as I get up so no one has to see the monster I become.

Edit2: I also forgot the horrible, gurgling upset stomach I have for the first few days. Literally Hitler.

This is all despite my BC pill, which is disheartening.        A day or two before my period I'd suddenly come to realise how awful my life is, how I will end up alone and crazy. Most words spoken to me have deeper, crueller meaning behind them, and everything is worth crying over. I'd usually be back to my chipper self within 36 hours.

I'm immensely lucky in that I don't get the debilitating 1-2 week long depressions any more, and I actually cry very little these days, if at all.       </snippet></document><document><title>How do I get my husband off this horrible threesome obsession?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18a8rl/how_do_i_get_my_husband_off_this_horrible/</url><snippet>My husband and I have been married less than a year and all he can seem to talk about lately is bringing another woman in and it hurts. I will admit in college I experimented with lady love and have dated women, but my husband sees this information as I am totally fine with having another woman within our relationship. It bugs me. It is deeply insulting to me. I feel like I am not good enough for him, or i am doing something wrong. He has taken this kick he is on too far, by finding women on craigslist and contacting old female flames. I just don't know what to say to him anymore to get him to drop it.

  "The only way you're going to get another woman in this bed is if I'm not there. So it's me and our marriage, or other women and a divorce. Your choice." **this**. This guy sounds like an asshole, and I'm sorry, I know he's the man you married and you must love him dearly, but if he doesn't respect your decision and comfort with something like this then who's to say he won't respect you saying "no don't buy that 2,000 TV" when you're low on money or a similar situation. It seems like he's exhibiting his ability to get what he wants no matter what by doing this, you need to let him know that it won't fly now or in the future. He does listen when it comes to finances, thank goodness. I think he is trying to be cheeky or something I dont know. He is so emotionally retarded. He does listen when it comes to finances, thank goodness. I think he is trying to be cheeky or something I dont know. He is so emotionally retarded.   I am very serious when I say this, but you two are sexually incompatible.  Your husband is looking for a marriage that is monogamish or open. You are not that way. 

There is a world of difference between being bisexual, pansexual, etc and being okay with an open marriage/relationship.  Just because you are not "straight" doesn't mean you're okay with sharing your husband.  Many couples are fine with this and that's totally cool for them.  YOu are not that person.

Sex with a third person absolutely needs to be based on mutual trust, respect and understanding.  Without those THREE things... a threesome will put the final nail in the coffin.  Your husband is being a douchebag.  A big, fucking douchebag.  He is being rude, disrespectful, and the opposite of someone you can trust.  This is NOT the guy you open a relationship with.  This is a guy you either go to therapy with or court for a divorce.

I am very sorry to be that blunt.  But there seems to be a lot of denial on your part... I don't blame you.  I wouldn't want to see this either.  Your husband may well be a very nice guy at times.  He seems to have been in denial himself over his ability to only have one vagina forever.  That makes him a guy who needs to learn about himself, whether he can keep to the promise he made you and if he can be the kind of husband you need him to be.  Rather than do that deep thinking about himself, he has chosen to force you, his wife, to become someone she is not.  That isn't fair and for some reason he sees this as easier than being his true self.  That's not cool.  

At this point, OP, lay down the law. Make the appointment with a therapist and have him go with you.  Don't back down.

I'm just asking because there are weight requirements as a member of the military.  If you are above, your weight this could be your husband's asshole way of expressing his concern.  If you are at your weight, then he's a dick. She is not in the military, he is. She can be as fat as she wants without the government, military, or her husband telling her to lose weight. He sounds borderline mentally abusive. She said we are in the military.  I didn't know if that meant just he was in the military or both of them were in the military.  She doesn't specify in this thread.  And if she is in the military, she has to make her weight.  It sucks but it's a true part of being in the military.  I also made it very clear that her husband did it in an incredibly rude manner. I am not in the military, I can see where I was being confusing.   Guy here. My reaction to him would be "grow the f*ck up and be respectful to your wife". He's looking for you to say yes so he can have sex with another woman and not feel guilty.

I'm sorry your husband is doing this to you. I really think he thinks this is something I would enjoy deep down, like the time he basically forced me on a night dive even though I was terrified but then I ended up having a blast. I think you are giving him too much credit. If he can't respect you and drop it, you may need to take a more drastic approach.... Do you have someone you can stay with for a couple of days? Not really, we are military and I have just moved about 1800 miles from my entire support structure. Which makes this harder. Not really, we are military and I have just moved about 1800 miles from my entire support structure. Which makes this harder. You can do so much better than this.  

This guy is a disrespectful asshole who has succeeded in isolating you from your support network, so you're reliant on him and more likely to just give in so as to not lose him.  You can't fix him.  You can't persuade him to change his mind.  This is not your fault, there's nothing you can do to make this better.  Your husband should, were he a decent human being, listen to you when you say no and drop it once and for all.  Instead he's acting like a toddler, "but pleeeeeeeease can we do it?  Please please please?  If you loved me you'd say yes, waaaaaaaaaah".  Urgh.

If you give in to him this time, what will be the next thing he starts whining for?  Your self respect will be somewhere under the floorboards., and if he doesn't respect you after just 20 months of marriage (which he clearly doesn't), he never will.  

You can do so much better than this.   I really think he thinks this is something I would enjoy deep down, like the time he basically forced me on a night dive even though I was terrified but then I ended up having a blast. Have you ever given him reason to believe that you want to have sex with a woman?

Being pushed into doing something risky and dangerous is one thing. But being pushed into doing something emotionally scarring is completely another. I mean he might take me talking to old girlfriends as a reason, but we have remained friends, just without the sex. I do occasionally talk about it, but in a historical context, not a let's do this context. So in his mind, you've had sex with women before, so why not again? He sees a route to a completion of a fantasy of his own.

He obviously doesn't get what marriage means to you and it doesn't seem as if his value of the intimacy of your marriage is very high.

I think you need to explain to him in terms of what your marriage vows mean to you and that sex in marriage means more to you than just a means to an orgasm. Then draw a line in the sand about bringing it up again. If he steps over that line, enforce consequences. &amp;gt;So in his mind, you've had sex with women before, so why not again? 

Lol. What a ridiculous thought of his. I bet OP has also had sex with *other men* before, so does that mean she can just go have sex with other men now? I mean, his thought process is so utterly ridiculous I hesitate to even call it a "thought" process. &amp;gt;  I bet OP has also had sex with other men before, so does that mean she can just go have sex with other men now?

If the OP's husband got off on the idea, I suspect he'd say "yes".  And be puzzled if she didn't want to.

The problem here is that the OP has slept with women, the husband likes the idea and is willing to give her permission to do it again, and the only obstacle he can see is his permission.  He's assuming she'd want to sleep with other women (because, in his mind "why *wouldn't* you want to sleep with a hot woman?"), and the only reason not to is her marital obligation to be monogamous to him.

This is clearly dumb (it's entirely possible to *want* to be monogamous towards your husband/wife, rather than it merely being an obligation or duty), but apparently the husband views it this way (or at least, thinks the OP does).  And let's not forget, when you're dealing with all-time, *stereotypically* popular fantasies like "two chicks at the same time, man" it's incredibly easy for people to get really, really retarded, blinkered and over-enthusiastic about things.

It's not admirable, and his inability to communicate and habit of ignoring what the OP says in favour of his own fantasies are serious character flaws, but it's hardly unbelievable or as out-of-left-field as you're making it sound. So in his mind, you've had sex with women before, so why not again? He sees a route to a completion of a fantasy of his own.

He obviously doesn't get what marriage means to you and it doesn't seem as if his value of the intimacy of your marriage is very high.

I think you need to explain to him in terms of what your marriage vows mean to you and that sex in marriage means more to you than just a means to an orgasm. Then draw a line in the sand about bringing it up again. If he steps over that line, enforce consequences. Holy shit, worst advice ever. 

&amp;gt; repress your desires and never speak of them again, or else

Way to build a healthy relationship.

OP it sounds like he doesn't know the subject hurts you. Make sure it's very clear that it's not something on the table. The desire won't disappear and if you force him to suppress or hide it from you it will most likely get worse.  Holy shit, worst advice ever.

I was in he exact same boat with my most recent ex-boyfriend. He was stuck on the threesome with another lady fantasy. He propositioned some ex-hookups of his by sending them intimate pictures of both of us! These were photos I agreed to do only on the condition that they would be totally private. He sent them to a chick he dumped to get with me! So yeah, she's got pictures of my ass now. Great. 

He was also into seeing me with another guy. I was uncomfortable with that and made it clear to him that sleeping with a total stranger turned my stomach. Despite that when I looked through his emails after the picture incident I discovered that he was actively trying to arrange for a random guy of craigslist to "surprise"me in bed (!)-- basically trying to orchestrate a rape. Luckily craigslist man seemed rightfully skeptical of the set-up and didn't agree.

Aside from all this-- the indifference to my feelings on the matter, the violation of trust and humiliation of sharing those pictures, and the attempt at sexual assault my ex-boyfriend was a "great" guy. He was sweet and handsome and a bunch of other things that made me fall in love with him. 

But that is not enough. It's easy to be a great boyfriend (or girlfriend for that matter) when everything is going your way. Conflicts are the true test of a couple's compatibility. 

Your husband shared a fantasy with you and you said no. 

A savvy man would've dropped it then, knowing that the cards were on the table and if you were into it or changed your mind, you were free to say so. 

But he didn't drop it and proceeded to pressured you to the point of making you cry. Even a dense man would've dropped it there for sure because he was undeniably hurting your feelings.

But your husband isn't just dense, he's uncaring.

This incident has shown that your husband does not care about your feelings if they get in the way of him getting what he wants. If you stay with him this dynamic will punctuate your marriage. Don't expect negotiation or compromise on anything-- from sex, to finances, to children-- in the future. He's made it clear that it's his way or nothing, your feelings are only relevant in so much that they fall in line with his. This threesome thing isn't just one harmless kink hang-up*; it's big neon warning sign of what's to come.

Whether or not you want to suffer through that your whole life is up to you. Things like this don't just get better by ignoring them or giving in. I can tell you I was heartbroken leaving my ex, but the more time passes the happier I get. The dynamic took a huge toll on my self esteem. I can look back and realize how truly miserable being with him made me.

*nothing inherently wrong with having a kink for threesomes of anything else, but forcing or pressuring a partner and pushing boundaries against their wills is abusive.    I feel like a total failure at my marriage. Counseling, in the first year? Isn't that some kind of sign that I was doomed from the start with this whole marriage thing? I am not big on God but I am big on keeping the promises I make, and this is starting to feel like I need to back out. I feel like a total failure at my marriage. Counseling, in the first year?

Honestly, individual counselling can be really helpful because it helps you get in touch and keep in touch with yourself and how you are feeling, which can only help communication. How can you effectively communicate when you don't know how you feel and don't know how to properly express and respect feelings? Couples counselling can be great because it sets aside a specific time for you to both present problems and deal with them without it coming up in an argument, although if both people don't come in with an understanding that either or both of you may need to change, it won't help (not to say you don't feel that way but that if you *or your husband* aren't at least open to ideas then it won't work)

Lol yes! And his response is "you like women and men sexually, I don't" So ask how he'd feel if you fucked another guy in his bed while he played video games.  And either way, why should it matter to you if he's turned on by the threesome, when it seems not to matter to him if you're turned on by it? Lol yes! And his response is "you like women and men sexually, I don't" Lol yes! And his response is "you like women and men sexually, I don't" I hear this argument a lot and it is stupid. Just because someone is attracted to both genders doesn't mean they are a sex freak with an out of control libido who is up for anything. A monogamous relationship is just that-monogamous, whether it's with a man or a woman.  Tell him if you wanted threesomes, you would not have committed to a monogamous relationship.      Okay, your husband clearly has some issues.  He's competitive, narcissistic, emotionally retarded (something did you notice before the wedding), and unable to listen to your needs in your relationship.  Now I want to know a few things:

-Has your husband deployed in either Iraq or Afghanistan?  He could be dealing with untreated PTSD that is manifesting in his current treatment of you.  I would highly encourage him to seek psychiatric help.  More and more service men/women are seeking help.  It is no longer stigmatized and all information is kept completely confidential.  Obviously this doesn't excuse his behavior but gives insight on how he can get better.

- Did you notice any of this issues (ie the emotional retardation) before the wedding?  Or did this behavior begin after the wedding?  Some people rebel/can't handle the first year of marriage or marriage in general.  If these problems didn't begin until you were married, then you definitely need to seek couples counseling.

-Why do you consider counseling failure?  Your marriage is struggling.  That isn't a negative reflection on you.  Fact of life is that the first year of marriage is one of the hardest years in a marriage.  Getting counseling is like taking medication for a strep throat.  You've identified a problem and instead of ignoring, you are taking proactive steps towards solving the problem.  It will be easier for you to stop blaming yourself and feeling like a failure because you're not.

Here's where I get tough on you, you're a member of the military.  You are a strong woman who has fought against the patriarchy of the military system.  Yes you are far away from home, yes you are without friends and family, and yes that is very scary.  But you are strong enough to stand on your own two feet.  If you need to leave your marriage, you are strong enough to leave without submitting yourself to the ridiculous demands of a man.  Depending on your rank and base location, you should make enough to be able to find housing outside of the home you share with your husband.  Most areas surrounding bases, cater to members of the military, ie shorter/more flexible leases.  Having a backup plans never hurts.  

 I am not military. I misspoke when I said we in an earlier post. He has not been deployed. He left for basic training a week after our wedding so the first 4months or so he was in training. He was not really like this until we started the process for a catholic wedding, and I chalked his behavior up to him being frustrated with the tedious process. We are not very religious but our grandmothers and families are so we did the catholic thing for them.               &amp;gt; feel like I am not good enough for him, or i am doing something wrong.

It's a sexual fantasy and has nothing to do with your abilities.  If he was into feet would you blame your breasts for not being good enough?  If he was a furry, would you feel insecure about not being hairy enough?

Unlike the other posters I'm not going to call him an asshole for being so disrespectful, because sometimes it's hard for people to see that what turns them on so much can also be hurtful -- in his mind it seems so amazing, how can it be bad?! Think of the thing that you love most in bed and imagine him trying to explain that you can't do that, and it hurts him every time you bring it up *even though he did it in college*.  Even still, this analogy falls flat because the male sex drive is so different.

But the bad news is that sexual fantasies don't go away, especially not "obsession" ones, so history and Dan Savage say that he will eventually have a threesome, whether you like it or not.  The question will only be are you guys married at the time and are you involved in it... I agree with you except for the fact that he is BULLYING HER INTO THIS.  Threesomes are great (hell my partner and I love having them) but they are had only with mutual consent and enthusiasm and a lot of trust and communication.  Both partners have to be into it or else it turns into a huge disaster.  

He's being an ass and needs to drop this, pressuring your partner into something is not the way to get what you want. I don't disagree, and I'm not sure where I said otherwise about his poor tactics.  I mean more to explain than excuse.

&amp;gt; He's being an ass and needs to drop this

My only point is that even if he drops it externally, it's going nowhere inside... Well of course the fantasy will still be there but he doesn't need to be an ass about it.  Besides if he really wants a threesome pestering her and giving her reasons NOT to trust him (i.e. going behind her back and posted craigslist ads) then he can pretty much guarantee he'll never get a threesome.  Open relationships are built on trust, honesty and communication, if he wants a successful open relationship then he'd be better to foster the things I listed, not to bully his partner into giving in. &amp;gt; feel like I am not good enough for him, or i am doing something wrong.

I think I could probably get into later down the road, but I have always had this perception that threesomes within a marriage were for like 10 years down the road to spice things up or something like that... Where I feel I am failing is that he wants this and we are less than a year into marriage and in total from first date to now its only been about 20 mons.  Can we not treat him like he's some horrible man-troll who just wants to hurt his wife? This is not acceptable behavior but let's not demonize. OP, have you considered couples counseling? At least you'd be better informed about whatever decision you want/need to make. 

&amp;gt; He has taken this kick he is on too far, by **finding women on craigslist and contacting old female flames**

I'm trying real hard not to judge but that is a pretty bad thing to do to your wife

&amp;gt;I have tried crying, I have tried yelling, I have tried being logical, nothing works

[deleted] I am very very new to reedit and I was seeking some conversation tactics, that I haven't tried to try and steer him away from continuously bugging me about this. [deleted] [deleted]  Sorry but you can't get your husband to stop fantasizing about this. And he probably couldn't even if he wanted. You could get him to tell you he's stopped but then he'd be a liar. As I read it, it's not the fantasizing that bothers her. It's his insistence that it needs to move from fantasy to reality, even if she's not comfortable with it. So he needs to grow up and realize that if his wife isn't on board with his fantasy, then it needs to remain in fantasy land. That, or he can get out of the relationship and then find someone else to fulfill it with him.

His fantasies are his business, but he can't expect his wife to just be on board with all of his fantasies even if she doesn't share them and is made downright uncomfortable by them. That is exactly right. I don't care what goes on in his head, because what goes on in mine isn't exactly something that i necessarily want to be reality either. Where my issues are is that he is creeping my facebook friends being like "were you with her? she's hot...you think she would be down?" and then proceeding to message her behind my back. It's mortifying to hear from women respect and work with that your husband asked them to bed with you. That is exactly right.

She was one of the first people I met when I moved to a new city, and we hit it off immediately. She's one of the only people who just GETS me and my sense of humor and my view of the world. 

We live in the same zip code, but I haven't seen her since June, and she hasn't even met my boyfriend of almost two years. She's always been a little hard to get in touch with, but lately she's been super flaky to the point where I double-book when we're scheduled to hang out. 

Our text message logs are a broken record. I'll ask what's her schedule for the next week (she works shifts and never has a regular schedule), she'll take two or three days to get back to me saying she'll check, I'll ask again in a week, and so on. She'll tell me she misses me, we make a date, and then she cancels at the last minute. There's been one time in the last 8 months that I had to cancel, because I couldn't afford to spend any money, and she wrote back five minutes before we were supposed to meet saying she'd just gotten off work, so it wouldn't have been a good day anyway.

They're always perfectly valid excuses--stomach virus, working late, grandmother passed away, etc--and she's always super apologetic, which makes me feel guilty for bringing it up to her. But coupled with the fact that she either doesn't answer or takes three days to answer my requests to hang out, I feel like I'm putting way more effort into our friendship than she is, and I end up feeling more annoyance than sympathy when she has to cancel. I hate that my reacting to her text saying, "I've been throwing up since Friday" is a giant eye roll. It's just that it's always *something*.

I really, really miss my friend, and I want her to be a part of my life, but I feel like a chump for always being the one who initiates scheduling and being canceled on. I honestly don't think it's that she doesn't want to see me or be friends anymore, or else I'd just suck it up and let her fizzle out of my life. Should I bring it up with her or am I being unreasonable?   I don't think you are being unreasonable.  I am like your friend, ten years younger though, so I don't know if that invalidates what I have to say.

I have a host mental health and addiction issues that I am only just figuring out how to manage.  Because I always acknowledged my unreliability, and was so apologetic, my friends would rarely, if ever hold me accountable. Basically "Im honest about fucking up.  Now there's no need to fix it.". 

I think it would be a good idea to tell her that it needs to change.  Maybe if you can do whole "i know sometimes things go to shit in my head, so I tell (whoever) I can't meet them today, cause I don't want them to have to deal with me"...

Or something akin to that.  The only reason I'm aware of how my flakiness is disrespectful to my friends now is that I went to a therapeutic community rehab for 6 months.  Every day I had anywhere from half to two dozen women calling me out on my bullshit, and being there for me when I decided to get honest.

So maybe things aren't so crash hot for her, and she's not asking for help.  And pushing a friend away is shitty.  Even if her intentions are good. I have thought about this. I definitely went through the same thing when I was in my worst "black clouds" period of my depression. I would blow people off at the last minute, even lying about anxiety attacks to get out of a commitment. However, I've been very open with her about my struggles with depression/anxiety, so if she doesn't feel she can be the same way with me, that's obviously something we need to work on, anyway.

Part of my own anxiety is, basically, why I'm so afraid to bring it up with her. I don't want to attack her for something like that, and if somebody told me I was being a bad friend, I'd feel like a piece of shit. 

(Also, had to look up "crash hot" and now it's my new favorite phrase!)      In every relationship (friendship, family, romantic, etc...) a power dynamic usually develops where one party is usually dominant and gets to set the terms of the relationship, i.e., they never call, they expect to be called, they get to choose what activities the parties do, etc...  In this situation it appears that your "friend" has taken the upper hand and expects you to text her, plan everything, etc...  You have 2 options: 1) keep supplicating and being the submissive one or 2) stop supplicating and see if she still makes an effort to be your friend. 

My personal strategy is to make "rules" for my friends.  I never call more than twice in a row, I never wait more than 20 minutes, etc...  If they violate the rules they are out.  While I don't think I'd go so far as making strict rules (not my personality), I think I have already basically followed your advice. When she told me she was sick (after having tried to connect with her for over a month), I simply replied, "Feel better" and ignored her subsequent apology. I don't want to be cold but I do want to convey that I'm not happy with the situation.    I have been in the SAME situation, I even have a small matching tattoo with this girl, we were friends for 11 years. Everything you said about her is the same with my friend. I decided to stop initiating it and if she wanted to hang out when it's good for her, that she would call ME. Well its been 2 years since I last hung out with her. Kind of opened my eyes, and although it makes me sad, I know I have better friends out there. 

Sorry I don't have much advice, but I thought I'd share a similar experience and the outcome of it. Best of luck to you!   YES.  I would LOVE to hear the justification for this behavior from the 'flaky friend' because I have SO MANY.  I wish I could get more reliable friends who respond to you in a reasonable amount of time and follow through on their plans with you.  Is there a friend store I can go to or something!??

In all seriousness OP I wish I had advice for you, because it's something I struggle a lot with myself!  This probably won't help, but with my flaky friend, I arranged something once a month for us to do on the same day (first Sunday worked for us), so she knew we were hanging out way in advanced and couldn't give last minute excuses. Might not work though since your person has a weird work schedule. </snippet></document><document><title>"The Feminine Mystique" at 50: Three feminists on Betty Freidan's legacy</title><url>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/11/the-feminine-mystique-at-50-three-feminists-on-betty-freidan-s-legacy.html</url><snippet /></document><document><title>I don't understand my menstrual cycle</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18c4sm/i_dont_understand_my_menstrual_cycle/</url><snippet>I've always had short cycles, varying between 17-26 days. The average would be 22 days. I track my periods using an app and I almost never have consistent durations, if I had a longer cycle one month the next will be ridiculously short. Can anybody explain to me what some common/reasonable explanations for this would be?

I'm twenty years old, I exercise regularly, probably seven days a week (I work at a rock climbing gym). I eat healthy, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and I'm not a vegetarian or an extreme carnivore. I get lots of sleep. I meditate and/or walk a few times a week so I don't think I'm stressed. I don't live with any other girls. I'm not on any birth control (and haven't been for 18 months), but I was on the pill. However I would still spot when I was taking the pill so I don't really think that normalised anything.

What am I missing? I don't know why I'm not regular! Is it even important to be regular? My periods are short (four days), medium flow and always painless.    As LXV said, some women just don't have a regular cycle. Usually it doesn't matter from a health perspective--unless your cycle's changed suddenly or you have other symptoms that could point to a disorder, but going to a gyno regularly would catch most issues.

It can be a pain in terms of convenience, though. I've been on different version of hormonal BC for the last several years, and that's the only way I'm ever regular. If your body handles hormonal BC, you could look into getting that.  </snippet></document><document><title>UTI, Bacterial Vaginosis or something else??</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18c4lv/uti_bacterial_vaginosis_or_something_else/</url><snippet>I am so frustrated and need help desperately. Yesterday I went into a urgent care clinic to get tested for a UTI. I have been having symptoms of a UTI for awhile thinking it was a interstatial cystitis flare up. I used one of those home UTI test strips twice. They both came up positive, ive also had a kind of strongish smelling urine. But when I went to the clinic and gave a urine sample, the doctor told me I had no signs of a UTI,  but of bacterial vaginosis instead. I'm very confused, because I've been having the exact symptoms of a UTI or a IC flareup because I have had both many times. The burning in the urethra, and the weird urine smell.

I don't really have symptoms of BV excluding, admittedly a slight sushi smell. But my discharge has been normal with no itchiness. The other thing that bothers me about this diagnosis is that a week ago I had a pap smear done at my yearly checkup and they said nothing looked abnormal. I had been experiencing these symptoms before I had the smear done. So how could it be BV? 

This is all very concerning because the burning I've been experiencing is exactly like my IC flareups or a UTI. And the last two times my fiance and I had sex, it made my urethra burn and feel very uncomfortable. I took a couple urinary burn relief pills made for UTI pain (the stuff that makes you pee orange) ans it felt better, but I still wanted to be sure it wasn't a UTI, so I stopped taking those and cleared out my system. So I know those didn't mess up my urine test. I'm just so very frustrated because I've been diagnosed with something else when I have some of the symptoms of a UTI. I just want some advice and see if others have felt UTI symptoms during a BV infection. This all worries me because this burning has been off and on for months, and it just now started burning with sex. If my pap smear didn't catch this infection, what gives?  I understand why you're frustrated but there's no need to be worried. The symptoms of BV are very similar to a UTI really the testing is the only way to differentiate. Plus a Pap smear is a test that is specifically used to look at cervical cells to see if they are normal cells. They DON'T look for anything else unless they tell you they are taking more swabs. To test for BV they would need to have done a high vaginal swab as well as the pap ear one and prepared a slide specifically to look for BV and trichomoniasis. These slides have to be stained a specific way to see the 'clue' cells of BV. If they didn't do this, they definitely wouldn't have known you had it.

If the doctor did a urine dipstick and it was negative for signs of UTI you can't really have one. 

TL:DR - Guys, unless you ask or hey specifically tell you, Pap smears DO NOT test for anything other than cervical cell abnormality. Ah see I didn't know BV wont show up on a pap unless specifically asked for that test. I just thought if anything was out of the ordinary at all they'd see it :/ I'm currently on the vaginal cream the doctor prescribed for BV and seeing what it does for me. The only real reason I'm worried about BV is that I have no idea how long this has been going on without my knowledge, and I've read that it can increase your chance for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Just out of interest, what cream is it? I understand why you're frustrated but there's no need to be worried. The symptoms of BV are very similar to a UTI really the testing is the only way to differentiate.

TL:DR - Guys, unless you ask or hey specifically tell you, Pap smears DO NOT test for anything other than cervical cell abnormality. Many doctors check for chlamydia or gonorrhea as standard practice during a pap smear, but you should ask specifically if you care.

But I agree, things like BV, yeast, and UTIs are not tested for during a pap.  I hate to suggest this, but have you been tested for STDs recently? </snippet></document><document><title>As a woman studying STEM, sometimes, the uphill battle seems too steep</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/189qcc/as_a_woman_studying_stem_sometimes_the_uphill/</url><snippet>This is my last semester of university, and I'd like to think that I'm fairly competent, as far as a student goes. There's a lot more to learn, but I have a pretty good foundation. However, I keep bumping into people who assume I'm incompetent because I'm a woman, and sometimes it gets terribly frustrating. 

This was brought on by the following recent events:

1. I'm doing a capstone project, and we had to have a partner. The professor for the capstone class rarely addresses or even looks at me during the team meetings. He looks at my partner. Even if my partner can't answer a question or answers incorrectly, it's okay, the professor assumes he just needs time to reacquaint himself with the material. Whenever I answer correctly, it's a "good guess." While I did not take the professor's course in this subject, I took the graduate level version, which is much heavier on the theory and math. Through my extracurriculars, I am well acquainted already with the material. How many "good guesses" until the professor decides I'm competent? I didn't believe the rumors that this professor was a racist and sexist, now I'm starting to doubt. 

2. My friend is applying to graduate school programs. One of the labs she's looking into is all-men. She will be that professors first female graduate student. I hate that she has to worry if she'll be treated differently for being a woman, or if people will think she got accepted with a lower standard because she's a woman. She is one of the smartest people I know at school.

3. Whenever I call my father, he keeps bringing up marriage. How important it is to choose a good husband, to choose a career that leaves time for the kids, to choose a grad school based on the probability of finding a "nice [Asian type] boy from a good family" etc. It's like all the hard work I've invested over the years don't even matter. I love my coursework, my research, my activities. I feel unsettled after every phone call with him, and the worry is starting to interfere with my work. I stood up to him once, and he said it was a waste of money for me to have gone to university, if I just got these strange ideas about not marrying. WTF, I'm on full scholarship, and even that comment wouldn't have hurt so much, if he didn't always talk about how he was going to send my younger siblings to Ivy League universities and was saving up for them. I got into Ivies, and at that time, he just wanted me to go to the local state school, which is ranked terribly low. (My family is not even close to qualifying for financial aid.) I went to the best university I could get a full scholarship to. In his mind, is my hard work meaningless? 

4. I do research, and this is my first time with a professor who is a man. I didn't think it would matter. He was encouraging me to apply for the NSF fellowship, because of my academic record, would have preliminary data, etc... and also how there was a slight advantage for women. Maybe there is, and maybe there isn't, but it's almost painful to consider how people might think down the line, "she only got it because she's a woman..." maybe not for that fellowship (depending on my future plans, I might not even apply) but for the other awards I've won. There's already enough of that whispering around on my undergraduate campus.

5. Whenever a fellow engineering student goes, "Oh wow! A girl interested in [subjects]!" the way they emphasize my gender makes me feel like they see me as first a female and second as a peer. What does it matter that I'm a woman interested in these subjects? And especially, especially when they make comments about how women are more emotional, have worse analytical skills, are not as naturally gifted at math, and just don't enjoy science/math/engineering. At best, these bio-truths are averages, and the contribution of social conditioning isn't well-accounted for. I've even had people jokingly call me "not human" because I'm a workaholic and enjoy working on my projects, but it's natural for a man to be passionate, I guess.

**tl;dr It's frustrating when I'm treated differently as an engineering student who happens to be a woman. By professors, family, and peers. **   Yes, Yes, and Yes. It makes total sense that you are frustrated.  But: don't give up.

I'm a postdoc (joint in Computer Sci and Environmental Studies, my PhD is in Engineering/Applied Math).  Also: female.  My pure math undergrad seems like a gender equity paradise compared to the space I occupy now (10% women?).

People you respect will underestimate you (don't take it personally, there is a lot of that koolaid floating around).  The next time your partner makes a mistake in front of your professor, correct him. Not carefully/politely: just accurately.  

People will openly tell you that you got certain things more easily because you are a girl.  What is most hilarious is when this comes from a student you know is weaker than you.  This happened to me a lot because when we got tests back I didn't want to make people "feel bad" that they hadn't done as well as me, so when they told me their scores, I kept my mouth shut. Later they were very surprised when I kept getting awards and scholarships. Very occasionally you may have some advantage, but 1) opportunities are opportunities 2) there are actually several studies that replacing women's names with men's names increases journal acceptance rates. You are where you are because of talent and hard work.

Families mean well, but their vision of your best interest is their vision only. It doesn't have to be yours. Sometimes well-meaning families invest less in female children than in male children; this sucks, and is a reason to feel angry, but don't let it throw you off what you want to do.  Our parents grew up thinking that a woman couldn't really hope to support herself: this is the past.  The future is that many STEM degrees (especially Masters and up) will let you live anywhere you want and get paid a lot to do work that is usually way more interesting than average. (Unless you want to be an academic, where you still will get paid pretty well, but will have less geographic choice). It is natural that people who care about you want you to have things they think will make you happy...even if they are wrong about what those things are.

The NSF graduate Fellowship is awesome.   Apply for it. Apply for it multiple times (I got it my second time). Get as much feedback as you can from anyone who will read your application. It is three years of very-close-to-complete intellectual freedom. NSF believes that American Science will benefit from a diverse and broad set of science practitioners: they are right, jam your foot in that door. (Also, depending on your field, NDSEG and DOE have even-better-funded Fellowship Programs for grad school.  Even if you think your topic is a long-shot for these funding sources, try for them: it is a lot of money, a lot of freedom, and a lot of credibility down the line).

By the way, my life is awesome. As part of my postdoc, I teach really bright masters students in CS this quarter (at one of those Ivy League schools), and I spend a bunch of time talking and collaborating with super-smart scientists and engineers. I have questions I am deeply interested in, I get to travel all over the world, and it feels like an absolute miracle to be able to make a living by thinking about cool ideas.  Occasionally I have to "man up" and call out gender bias in my working environment, but this is hardly part of my daily life. When it is, I find a little autistic-math-genius routine can be very useful. 

As your father might hope, I do meet some very nice smart men as an incidental perk of my field. I know it is annoying not to be one of the "normal students" but some of your classmates are probably just being weird to you because they don't know how to interact with girls.  

Also: Start looking for social programs for women in your field; it will help you feel less weird.  Some of the crap you face you will have to laugh off, and it is easier to do this if you have a few friends who know what you're talking about.

 Thanks for your advice. The team meeting went better today. 

I'm actually hoping for MD/PhD, so I will not be applying for NSF (unless I drop the MD half). However, thank you for the sentiment all the same.   /r/LadiesofScience 

I understand the "you got it because you're a woman".  I got that shit from some guys my sophomore year, when I'd just switched into the major and got into an REU that summer.  Apparently I needed to "prove myself".  Oh well, try not to let it get you down.  As a Lady of Engineering, you're going to have to find a way of coping with that because it's going to haunt you for your whole career. Like all the pioneers and trailblazers you're going to be taking significantly more rough than smooth, but the women who follow in your footsteps will appreciate that you did.

I have a scientific background and have a hilariously family unfriendly career in a heavily male dominated environment. My femininity is always the thing that first strikes my colleagues about me, because women in my field are so unusual. 

Experience has taught me to really not give a fuck about it. I used to give a lot of fucks. The things you describe used to really get to me. And, for a while, all that fuck giving made me very unhappy- because although I gave a lot of fucks, it was still happening. All those energy sapping, time consuming fucks were going to waste.

Not giving a fuck is a lot harder than it sounds and it takes quite a bit of training. It's a process. You have to work at it. It doesn't come naturally. Still, from time to time, I am subjected to something so potentially infuriating that I have to separate myself from the situation and really consider if it's worth one of my very valuable fucks. It never is. 

What's great about not giving a fuck though, is that it does free up a lot of time and energy which you can then utilise on valuable worthwhile things, like being the best you can be (which by the sounds of things is pretty damn awesome). As a Lady of Engineering you're going to have to prove your immense engineering prowess more regularly than your penis owning peers. Don't give a fuck about it, just wipe the floor with them and quietly step away.

Not giving a fuck about some things also opens up the door to saying "fuck it" to a lot of other things- and you wouldn't believe how much unimportant shit you can deal with using that philosophy.

[TL;DR](http://i.imgur.com/KNW84UW.jpg)
 I like to think of the bullshit behaviour described by OP as the equivalent of the perpetrator walking around with a big sign on their head that says "I'm a FUCKWIT", and I think 'thank you for identifying yourself so efficiently, I will not waste any of my fucks on you :)' As a Lady of Engineering, you're going to have to find a way of coping with that because it's going to haunt you for your whole career.

  I'm a former engineering student, and I feel you.  Definitely go for the NSF fellowship - it will be a major feather in your cap if you get it.  I got one, it paid for my Master's degree, and I graduated debt-free; and also, it got me into fancier colleges than I would normally have, and it's a nice line to have on my resume.  There's nothing you can do to make it more or less advantageous for women - personally, I don't think that there is any advantage for women for that particular fellowship.

If it's any consolation to you, the workplace is nowhere near as sexist as academia.  I worked as an engineer for 3 years after graduation (then the instability of the job market really got to me, and I went into patent law), and I did not see any sexism at any of my jobs.  I was respected as an equal and treated fairly - even at the job where I was one of only two female engineers in our office.  

But while you are in academia, yeah, you will encounter sexist jerks.  Develop a method for dealing with them that does not hurt you.  If some professor treats you like an idiot and talks to your partner rather than to you, either fight him or let it go.  Don't let it fester and dwell on the resentment.  In the case of your professor, I don't think it's worth fighting him on this; just keep telling yourself that he is a sexist jerk and that you won't have to endure him for much longer, and let it go.  In other cases involving sexist jerks, you may need to fight them.  Again - fight, do all you can, and let it go.  

 I am unsure what is it about academia, but even in non STEM fields (I am in Liberal Arts) working as a graduate student and Adjunct, in my experience, is very sexist. 

I am an archaeologist and in the field I play with dirt and shovels, and my team is mostly male: not one sexist remark --unless we're drunk and then they are just trying to get on my nerves on purpose. 

The rest of the year, in a classroom (mostly females) sexist remarks LEFT and RIGHT. It is kind of weird. Social Work here.  A field dominated by women, men who enter the field are praised as gods and the upper echelons of academia and leadership are dominated by men. :( I'm a former engineering student, and I feel you.

  I am a man, but I am also a graduate student in a STEM field, so I want to address point number 4:

Nobody will know anything about why you got the fellowship except the fact that you were good enough to get it.  The NSF does not give those things out for free to *either* gender.  **Go for it**.  An NSF fellowship will be absolutely *money* on your CV.   If I decide to go to grad school (taking a gap year right now), I'll apply. However, I'm more interested in MD/PhD, which doesn't qualify for that fellowship.

Thanks for the advice though!  I am a man, but I am also a graduate student in a STEM field, so I want to address point number 4:

An NSF fellowship will be absolutely *money* on your CV.   You make a great point in this and your followup comment.  Who cares if a few idiots think you only got it because you're female?  No matter how brilliant you are or what you get, there will always be some dingbat who thinks you only got there because of your gender.  (See Sotomayor)

Besides, while it might be true that the OP's gender helps her in this case, despite what sexist dudes are going to think, it will far more often hurt her.  Yeah, it sucks. I'm a chemical engineering phd with undergrad degrees in chemical engineering and material science, so I definitely know what you're talking about.

My freshman year of undergrad, I joined a fantastic research team consisting of 9(!!!!!!) postdocs and several grad students just because having a pretty face on the team was in their best interest. That kind of solidified my reputation around campus about how I'm just skating by on gender/looks instead of ability - even several years later when I was near the top of all my classes. I wish I could go back and not take that position.  When I was doing my physics degree I got this all the time. I remember the professor sorting us into pairs for a lab project "John you partner with Dan, Steve you can work with Dave ... Etc ... Simon, you can look after Miss Chickpea123uk". What made it even worse, Simon was a moron who didn't have a clue what to do, so I did the whole experiment on my own but he got all the credit for it. 
Now I work in life sciences and all that stuff has gone away like so many soap bubbles. Until I wrote this I never considered that I moved from physical sciences to life sciences just to escape the misogyny, but maybe that's why.   I have a BS in biochemistry and I can relate. It's funny, I never got shit in my biology, biochem or chemistry courses-- they always had a large amount of women in them, but others were a different story. My degree required Physical Chemistry and pre-reqs for that were the same math and physics sections that physics and engineering majors took. A lot of (but certainly not all) students professors, and TAs were pretty condescending to me and treated me like I was this poor silly thing stuck in the big boys courses. I was actually really good at calculus and physics-- I got better grades in those courses than in biochem.

I found a lot of the boys in engineering to be very arrogant. They loved to talk about how smart they were and how much money they were going to make. There was a weird hierarchy they believed in when it came to academic majors. Not just about STEM fields being "better" than liberal arts, but engineering being superior or requiring more intellect than life sciences. Even a bizarre attitude that chemistry was inferior to physics as a major, despite the incredible overlap in those fields. 

It all boiled down to ego. Being an engineering major is a badge of pride, men "suffer" through those difficult courses because they are so tough (and there's a subsequent de-emphasis on majoring in that because they truly enjoy it). I think women get a hard time in STEM fields because their existence in a "masculine" sphere is a challenge to the ego. If a girl can do it, it must not be that hard in their minds!

I saw this ego in other place.  I worked a peer chemistry tutor in college and I noticed there was a distinct difference between how boys versus girls dealt with difficult courses. Boys were much more likely to complain about the fairness of a test or grading scheme and blame a professor for being too difficult.  To be clear, most guys weren't like this, but of the students who were, they were virtually all male. Girls usually blamed themselves when they found material difficult.

I hope you don't get too discouraged. Keep your head up. Think of these condescending professors as mere means to your ends. I currently work in science and it's really rewarding. In the real world or grad school there's no ego about having a hard major (everyone around you has a degree, so what's the big deal?) and much fewer assumptions about your abilities. Your work is what people really care about. That sounds quite bad! I'm an engineer, but also took physical chemistry to fulfill a pre-med requirement. Luckily, people were pretty nice to me, and I'm still in contact with my TA. I do see more of the bad behavior in my EE major than BME major though, so maybe your idea about ego fits.  Yeah. It's weird. I think there's a different mentality with pre-med students too. See, they might be getting a challenging undergrad degree but they aren't *there*, in medical school yet, so they're a bit more humble and too stressed out to spend a bunch of time patting themselves on the back for being so bright. The electrical engineers don't need to worry about grad school (for the most part), they expect to waltz out of undergrad into a 60K job right away!

Are you planning on going into a PhD/MD program?   Funny you're freaking out about this. My best friend is an asian female engineer. She was one of about 5 females engineers in her entire 120+ engineering program at our school, but she was never like "omg I'm the only female here and everyone treats me different! What should I do?!!?!"

You know what she did that you might want to remind yourself of? She just took charge whenever she was in a group, she asserted her presence just because she knew what to do. Professor ignoring you, and going to the other guy? You need to lead by example and say this is what is going to be done, and since it's a group project, everyone has equal say. If you haven't noticed, a lot of men in the STEM field are awkward around women. It's because there's not enough women in the STEM field to begin with, so they don't have a chance to interact. This leads to computer "nerd" who speaks misogynisticlaly on reddit because he frankly doesn't know enough about the gender, so he objectifies it.

Anyways, these guys are probably more clueless than anything, for example this professor you mentioned that hasn't had a female student before...they may objectify you because they haven't seen something like you before. So, like my bestie did, you need to lead by example, and show these peers and professors of yours that women are indeed competent in the STEM field, just as are men, no need to fret!

Now, my best friend works in a top 5 firm in a major US city. She's doing really well there, and she tries to play it down but I know she's really into the work at her coworkers seem to love her. They invite her out all the time and they're all friends. Remember, if you want to be just another STEM person, you can be. Gender doesn't matter and you need to remind people of that.

By the way, I also work in a STEM firm myself, and I know what the environment is like. So many men. I think this is generally good advice in terms of personal operating procedure, but I also think that many women are afraid of being perceived as pushy or "bitchy." This is not just paranoia:  studies document that when men and women engage in the same behaviour men are disproportionately admired and considered potential leaders, while women are considered bossy and controlling.  

I am glad though that your friend either has decent co-workers, or is tactful enough to avoid the ire of her coworkers, or is just so overwhelmingly awesome at her work that people don't dare to step.

I am glad though that your friend either has decent co-workers, or is tactful enough to avoid the ire of her coworkers, or is just so overwhelmingly awesome at her work that people don't dare to step. I really do think it just takes a strong person to gain the respect of others, no matter what gender. My friend just knows her shit, and it shows. So many women are too timid or unsure how to act in fields dominated by men. My friend isn't what I'd pin as assertive personality-wise, but more like if you ask her something engineering-related, her answers are straightforward and smart. If she thinks something is wrong, she just says so in a logical way. Really, just be yourself and show everyone why they hired you, or accepted you (as a student). I think this is generally good advice in terms of personal operating procedure, but I also think that many women are afraid of being perceived as pushy or "bitchy."

I am glad though that your friend either has decent co-workers, or is tactful enough to avoid the ire of her coworkers, or is just so overwhelmingly awesome at her work that people don't dare to step. Yeah.  And while you can be respected as a leader if you're thought of as a (male) asshole, nobody will respect you if they just dismiss you as a bitch.
The assertive role doesn't always work for women in leadership roles. Funny you're freaking out about this. My best friend is an asian female engineer.

By the way, I also work in a STEM firm myself, and I know what the environment is like. So many men.  First of all, don't give up. 

The first thing you need to do no matter where you end up for grad school (and you SHOULD go on to grad school- we need more women like you) is find a community of supportive women. Even if they're in a different field than you. You need someone to vent to about these issues who understands what you're going through and can lend advice and support. Go to a school that has a strong women in science advocacy group. I happen to run one at a pretty high-profile university, and we're part of a growing nation-wide network of young women scientists with an eye on these kinds of social issues. If you want to PM me I'm sure I can figure out how to put you in touch with similar programs at whatever schools you're planning to apply to. 

p.s. that whole "bio-truths" thing is bullshit. Even when it comes to averages. Differences between men and women's ability in science and math is reflective of the amount of sexism and other cultural forces in their country. Check out [this paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8801.abstract) and use it as ammunition.   I'm in the process of interviewing with some graduate programs for a STEM field.  At the schools I've visited, it's about 2/3rds women, 1/3rd men (both interviewing and current students).  I've made it a point to ask current female students about being a woman in science at the different universities.  They all have stories about assumptions being made about them because they're women, but overall they seem to think it's not a difficult thing.  Maybe it's just the specific field I'm looking at, I don't know. Is it a life sciences field?  Those are much more women-skewed.  I'm an engineering student at university as well. I haven't experienced any sexism to note. Maybe I'm blind to it. Or was told for so many years how it's going to be sexist, so I just ignore it. I just don't see it. 

I think perhaps it might be because my parents have always supported me, and when other people are being sexist I just don't notice, maybe I'm neive. 

With that being said, I think some things are largely a matter of persepective. My mom has a huge "the world is out to get me" complex. I've always tried to be the opposite, and maybe that's why I'm more resistant to it. 

Also, in the rare instances where I have noticed sexism, it's usually in my favor, so I just don't unstand this sentiment. Maybe its location thing? If someone else understands and explaination would be appreciated.    Ever tell your professor, 'How many good guesses will you decide I made before you consider that I understand the topic very well and know what I am talking about when I give you an answer?'

Sometimes you have to be forceful. No, because that sounds like a good way to get a bad grade. However, I was more forceful in the team meeting today, and it seemed to go well, so maybe it is getting better.  I'm having trouble seeing where he could grade you badly when this is a field that is not all that subjective, unless it's programming, in which case disregard everything I said.

I got lower grades than my male counterparts and I didn't notice until it was to late. I just rolled with it because there wasn't a way that it couldn't be spun against me due to how subjective programming could get and figured that I'll just out do this shitty professor in life. I'm not going to be a programmer anyway. It does hurt, I acknowledge that, but I can't let it bother me, real work is going to be much worse than that asshole professor and there's a moment where it's wiser to back off than come out swinging.  The grading shouldn't be subjective, but somehow, this professor has had a history of making it so. Also, the mapping from numerical grade to letter grade is not at all sensible. He's known for bumping up his favorites and *bumping down* students who have displeased him.  Let me guess, he has tenure?  Yep.   As a male physics major, I can tell you that the girls in my classes seem much better at physics than average students. Maybe it has to do with them being that much more driven to overcome the social conditioning their exposed to like the whole "girls can't do math" attitude. What's worse is I'll hear some of the smartest girls in my classes claim that they're bad at math. You're a fucking dean's list physics major at a top 10 university for our major. Fuck you. I wish I was as good at math as you, and I'm insanely good at math. &amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;

And look, regardless of your gender, STEM classes at a college level beyond lower-division classes are going to be fucking hard. Even moreso for grad students. Nobody worth your respect, and more importantly nobody worth working under, is going to think you're not just as much of a genius as the next person because women have it easier. STEM majors don't have anything easier. STEM classes themselves are almost impossible to have gender-bias. You can't really grade math in two different ways. There's not a whole lot of grey area. I don't remember having an UD physics class with participation points or other wiggle room for that sort of thing.

But you're going to have to come to terms with the fact that women aren't as common in your field. I've been in upper-division physics classes where maybe &amp;lt;10% of the students are female at a school with ~60% female student body.

When I find out someone I meet is also a hard-STEM major, I'm automatically impressed without regard to anything else. It's like an elite club of the uber-smart, and you're in it. I think people throw in your gender because it just makes it that much rarer, not because it's a lack of respect or anything, and to be totally honest, STEM people are awkward around women BECAUSE there aren't many women in STEM classes. I for one, have gotten way more socially retarded with girls since I finished all my GE classes. I'm just not around them almost ever anymore. I hate it but it's true.

And yes, you aren't human for enjoying working on projects and it has nothing to do with gender. </snippet></document><document><title>I used to love this song because it was silly and catchy, but listening to it 5 years later is a little heartbreaking.

Also, I don't know why I picked this subreddit, but I did. Sorry.

I got a call from his sister last night around 11 saying this was my fault. Then about an hour later she messages me on facebook apologizing and saying it isn't.

I got a call about an hour ago from his dad's girlfriend saying the family never wants to speak with me again. 

He had left a note, but the drugs he took didn't fully kill him. He's in the ICU, apparently made it through the night, but they don't want to tell me any more.

They wouldn't even tell me what was in the note.

He acted so happy when he spoke to me. He even texted me before he went to sleep that same night saying goodnight and he was sorry he missed my call. He never acted like he was in a shitty place - at least towards me. His dad's girlfriend said around them he'd throw out the "I'm going to kill myself" card every now and again. I live 6 hours away by car because I'm going to school out of state. We hadn't seen each other since winter break... about a month now.

I don't know why I'm typing this out right now, but I just needed an outlet. I want to know what's going on with him and as much as his sister may say it's not my fault, they sure aren't acting like it. What's the point in shutting me out? All I ever did was try to help him every day. 

He had a history of drug abuse and depression, so obviously that made it hard, but he was getting sober, or so that's what he lead me to believe. His family thinks its my fault because I never said anything. I didn't *have* anything to say! I didn't know anything was wrong! He was cheerful and determined when he spoke to me and he'd always call me if he was feeling down. 

I'm going to go lay down and cry a little more. I'm just trying to forget about it all. I feel like I'm walking through a dream. We dated for a year and a half and I wouldn't have traded the love I felt for this man for anything in the whole wide world. He made me feel like a princess and even called me Princess sometimes. Mostly our activities included going to Waffle House and sleeping and while that sounds totally pitiful when put down like this, it was the essence of our relationship and we were happy. 

Or so I thought.

Edit: My lifelong friend who was battling cancer just died. Also, this *is* partially my fault. I've been speculating on the letter that they won't tell me about and he probably wrote something along the lines of how he didn't want to be a burden on me. It is me kinda.

**Edit**: Thanks to everyone who's pushed me on this thread. I'm going to go to the campus counseling center tomorrow. Thanks for all the internet hugs. Took a nap and it cleared my mind, got rid of my headache and helped me to think straight.

**Another Edit**: Starting to spiral into feeling like shit. A friend of mine found what hospital he is in and I tried to call around 4. There's no phone in his room and the lady just said, "can't you call his cell?" I'm not even sure if he has it and is very likely he doesn't. So just left a message saying that if he does could he call me back? it's almost 7 and nothing. Nothing..

* **Another fucking edit** *:* My counseling center is *not* free. I decided to go today and they didn't say anything as I was filling out their paperwork. Then I get into the lady's office and about 75% of the time, we talked about *payment.* Fuck it. Fuck everything.  It looks like they're blame-shifting because the "kind of person who would try to commit suicide" isn't the "type of person we identify our son as being." They're reeling emotionally as well, and often blame-shifting like this occurs, especially when drugs are involved (especially if they didn't know he was using again, if at all; not sure of the situation). 

More to the point, I'm especially sorry they're blaming you. I don't think you're to blame whatsoever, just sounds like he had some personal demons. I know this is a rather effed situation and a difficult one at that, but you're not to blame.

You're welcome :) I didn't want to hijack your thread w/ personal experiences, but I'm familiar with your situation. Glad you're seeking some counselling, it will help you consolidate your thoughts and feelings! Take care. My counseling center is not free. I decided to go today and they didn't say anything as I was filling out their paperwork. Then I get into the lady's office and about 75% of the time, we talked about payment. Fuck it. Fuck everything. That's terrible! I think there are outreach groups in most communities. Maybe look into that? I'm sure 2XC could offer emotional support, as well.  (((hugs)))

You are in college - take advantage of the free counseling. You will Probably hit all the stages of grief, just like his family. 

You need to figure out deep in your heart, this is NOT your fault, but they may never want you in their lives again. And that's okay. 

They are lashing out in pain. You need to take care of yourself and learn the lesson you need to learn from this relationship. That's what counseling will help with. 

 I'm scared of the school counseling. I'm scared of all counseling. 

I'm still trying to take care of myself. Still went to my job yesterday, still went to meet my profile subject today. Applied for three jobs. 

I told him I wasn't going to be his nanny about things and he showed me he was determined.... I'm simultaneously grappling with being severely pissed off he was lying to me about sobriety, being worried sick about him and not being allowed to even know. Why are you scared of counseling? Bad experience? yes and I'm a socially nervous wreck. something that my boyfriend figured out how to tame because he also suffers from it. he was able to calmly and non-intrusively become a part of my life. before I knew it we were talking daily like old friends. I don't like talk to new people and especially counselors because I feel no connection with them.  I promise, they aren't there to judge you and they want to help. They might not judge, but they're still fleabags.

edit: sorry I didn't look at the parent post. thought you were talking about AlAnon. I think I'll be okay without a counselor for now. I have gotten myself out of shitty situations before.  Fleabags? It sounds like you've just met some bad counselors. It has nothing to do with getting out of a shitty situation. It's okay to seek objective help after something traumatic like this suicide attempt. Your anxiety in general is something that can be helped. I wasn't calling counselors fleabags. I didn't read the parent post and thought I was replying to someone talking about AlAnon. I also just told someone my logic behind coming to the Internet rather than meeting someone in real life.  They might not judge, but they're still fleabags.

edit: sorry I didn't look at the parent post. thought you were talking about AlAnon. I think I'll be okay without a counselor for now. I have gotten myself out of shitty situations before.  Please please go - you're willing to talk to us about this. You clearly need to talk to *someone* about this. The only difference between us and a counselor is that they are trained to deal with these issues and we aren't. That means they're going to be able to help much more. I posted an edit. All the pushing on this thread has really made me realize I should go. Found out the location and think I'm going to go over there tomorrow. Thank you. I can be pretty stubborn sometimes. But thanks. (((hugs))))

Remember, not every counselor will be a good fit for you.  It's okay to ask for someone different.  Not everyone clicks with every counselor.  If you feel like you are being judged by your counselor, or not understood, ask for someone else.   It's part of the job.  They are prepared for it.  

I've been to more than one counselor.  Some are good for breakups.  Some are good for self-esteem issues.  Some are good for communication issues.  Different counselors specialize in different things.

Take care of yourself, ask for help through the grief cycle and dealing with the suicide (mention that word) of your boyfriend.

I don't like talk to new people and especially counselors because I feel no connection with them.  If you decide to come to strangers on the internet for advice on this, but don't like talking to new people, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I understand people being hesitant to try counseling, but just like finding a friend, finding a connection with a counselor may not happen immediately. 

Try to have an open mind about counseling. It can really help and you certainly sound like you're in a position of feeling sad, helpless and lost. One of the biggest ways people benefit from counseling is simply having that secure outlet to vent - which it sounds like you might really enjoy having. 

Just try to have an open mind and don't immediately shut the door on opportunities to get help even if you're not sure counseling will help you, it certainly can't hurt. Quite honestly, THAT'S the reason I come to the Internet. I don't have to meet you fuckers (sorry) in real life. the whole "real life" thing is what makes it hard. Everyone here came to this post to genuinely help. I find paying someone to say kind words and let me talk, counter-intuitive to the whole point.   But they did a lot of work in order to become an expert in helping people, because they really want to help people. Otherwise they wouldn't have gone through all that trouble and schooling and work to become good at it. The only reason you have to pay them is because they spent a bunch of money to become a good counselor and they need to make that back and be able to live and eat and stuff. But they really do want to help you, or they wouldn't be doing it. You could think of it like that. I can't afford a counselor. I saw someone suggest this above, but if you are at school, there are almost certainly free services available.  Even if you aren't in school, I bet we can help you find someone to talk to for free or for what you can afford if you tell us generally where you are (or you could private message me your school or city and I can do some research for you.)

I don't really understand why you are adamantly against getting any help. It really seems like you could benefit from it, I bet you can find something you can afford, and there is absolutely no shame in talking to someone. I can't afford a counselor. I can't afford a counselor. You don't have to! I am sure your school has counseling options for students. Do you have a student health center? yes and I'm a socially nervous wreck. something that my boyfriend figured out how to tame because he also suffers from it. he was able to calmly and non-intrusively become a part of my life. before I knew it we were talking daily like old friends. I don't like talk to new people and especially counselors because I feel no connection with them.  Why are you scared of counseling? Bad experience? I'm scared of the school counseling. I'm scared of all counseling. 

I'm still trying to take care of myself. Still went to my job yesterday, still went to meet my profile subject today. Applied for three jobs. 

I told him I wasn't going to be his nanny about things and he showed me he was determined.... I'm simultaneously grappling with being severely pissed off he was lying to me about sobriety, being worried sick about him and not being allowed to even know. I read most of the replies and I just wanted to share my experience. Yes, by going to a university, they should have free counseling- most schools offer up to 12 sessions. 2 years ago, I hit absolute low as well. My mom didnt believe in counseling and said that it was just an excuse for people. One by one, I started pushing away friends, jobs, internships, etc. 

Finally one day I just couldnt handle it. I had a panic attack walking home and i was just stuck in the middle of the street. It finally hit me that it didnt matter whether or not I believed in counseling. I needed to vent, I needed to talk to someone. The internet can only offer so much, but the way the human emotions work (imho), is that you need something tangible. 

I walked into my school counseling offices and they saw me almost immediately. That first session, I went into the room, sat down and cried. Nothing much was said that session, but the psychologist just sat there and handed me tissues. For an hour I just sat there, hyperventilating and unable to speak or move. As the session came to a close, she scheduled my next appt and told me to call the schools hotline-- that night I did.

For my upcoming visits, she diagnosed me as clinically depressed (w/out suicidal thoughts) and wanted me to take some anti-depressants. Thats when it hit me. I needed to start talking or this wouldnt work. I had a goal in life and that was to become a doctor and for me to get there i would have to make a change.

Yeah, the things the psychologist suggested were bogus. She wanted me to do some meditating and do something with imagery. I called her out on it and told her that was some stupid shit. But she never gave up on me. And as much as i pushed her away, she never stopped listening to me. Psychologists have a lot of the "so how did that make you feel" crap. And i still laugh at it now, but I guess in a way it did help. 

What Im trying to say is that no matter how much you think seeing a counselor is stupid, do it. That first step means everything and it shows that even if youre not 100% you want to try doing something about yourself instead of blaming everyone else around you. To put it bluntly, stop the excuses and take care of your mental health. Its not all about physical help, and you if you have the opportunity, why not go for it. 
 I think your post really helped. I just looked up the location and think I'm going to head over there tomorrow after class. Thank you so much. My mental health is important to me and I appreciate your pushing. I think I needed it. I'm glad you are going! And no, not every counselor is awesome or the best for you, but you have options!

My first counselor and I were on completely opposite wavelengths. I mean, I am a very skeptical person who doesn't really believe in things without proof. Her name was Star and she called her practice "Dream Weavers". She believed in crystal healing. And that is awesome for people who believe in that kind of thing but we were hilariously opposite. But thankfully not every therapist is the same, and thankfully for most people you don't have to search too long to find one that works with you. Haha, I would have laughed in her face, too. Hopefully I have a more... grounded therapist. Yeah she wanted me to meditate and recite some phrase in my head about reaching out to the greater power and all that. And I'm sure that is great for people who believe in a higher power and that actually get something out of meditation but I am an atheist and all meditation does is make me bored. And sure I could try to believe in it but I am not going to change who I am as a person for the sake of a therapy method that might not even work.

Thankfully there are a lot of different coping mechanisms (and medication, yay klonopin) that work, you don't have to resort to believing in The Secret or auras in order to help yourself if you don't want to.

I hope your therapist is more grounded, too! Good luck. :) I've actually been trying to meditate on my own for short periods when I wash my face. Trying to clear my mind and all that... It's really hard. I don't do it to get to a "higher power" or anything, I just figured I could try it. I've heard its good for you just in general. 

I'm also kind of wary about going on any medications. Hopefully they won't prescribe me anything. Or if they do, it's something not as strong as klonopin. 

Thanks again. Yeah, I have found it to be helpful when I am in pain. I don't try to clear my mind but instead focus on my breathing to take my mind off the pain. I don't deny that meditation can be helpful, but when I am having a panic attack I don't have enough control over my brain to meditate.

And I actually suggested meds for myself, my therapist didn't even bring it up. I have panic attacks though so I only take them maybe once a month when I have one. They usually come at night so I don't even feel any side effects since I just fall asleep once they kick in. Medication isn't for everybody (I was on Zoloft but decided it wasn't worth it) but it can be a helpful tool for some. I'm scared of the school counseling. I'm scared of all counseling.

I'm simultaneously grappling with being severely pissed off he was lying to me about sobriety, being worried sick about him and not being allowed to even know.  When a crisis like this happens it's a lot easier for some people to look for a scapegoat rather than deal with the real issues at hand. Even if there is something in the suicide note about you, it is not your fault. Depression is a mental illness and attempts to self-harm is a symptom. You are not responsible for treatment.   People have different ways of dealing with grief, unfortunately they have a very shitty way of dealing with it which is to pick a scapegoat. It is natural for people to need an explanation they can understand to cope with emotionally jarring events. I'm sorry that this is happening to you but there is little that you can do to reason with them at a time like this. 

I hope your BF recovers psychically and mentally.  Don't think for a second that he did this because he wasn't happy with you or the relationship.  I'm someone that has struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and I probably wouldn't be here today if not for the girlfriends I've had over the years.  Companionship is one of the most important things anyone can have, but that goes double for someone facing depression.  The fact that he didn't tell you and acted cheerful is classic behavior for a depressed person.  We don't want the people we love to know how bad we feel inside because, as stupid as it sounds, we're trying to protect you from the pain we feel.  I'm sorry that he didn't say anything to you before he did this, that's pretty shitty, but I'm sure he loved you and wouldn't want his family to be treating you this way.  I guess we'll find out when he comes around fully.  Best of luck to you both. Don't think for a second that he did this because he wasn't happy with you or the relationship.

I'm so sorry this has happened to you. -Internet hug-  They told me he's "incoherent." They found him completely tripping out on whatever he had taken around 3:30 p.m. yesterday. They probably won't *allow* him to talk to me because I'm the bad guy... We're both 21 but they treat him like a child. I don't know if he's functioning. I don't know if I'll ever see him again. THEY WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING... 

I don't mean to yell.. but I want to know so bad. They told me he's "incoherent." They found him completely tripping out on whatever he had taken around 3:30 p.m. yesterday.

I don't mean to yell.. but I want to know so bad. you'll see him again when he gets better. it's really great that he has survive this far- my brother had an overdose a year before he died, was in an induced come for 3 days and lived- will his sister still have contact with you? that might be a good "in" No she won't. no one will.  The only advice I want to give you has to do with *you* because you can only prepare yourself for what's going to happen next. 

Contact your university's mental health clinic. 

Start seeing a counselor. 

The added stress of all of this could affect your grades and learning and whatnot. If that's the case, you'll have back-up should you need late course drops or a medical withdrawal from your classes.

If they're shutting you out, there really isn't anything you can do unless your boyfriend contacts you. Take care of yourself now. This is my last semester. I have to do it. I have to graduate. I can't let myself go. This is my last semester. I have to do it. I have to graduate. I can't let myself go.  &amp;gt;What's the point in shutting me out?

I have a feeling it has something to do with the note they refuse to share with you. I'm not saying you're to blame at all. However your boyfriend may have claimed in the note that you motivated him to self-harm. 

&amp;gt;His dad's girlfriend said around them he'd throw out the "I'm going to kill myself" card every now and again.

People who talk about suicide are most at risk for actually doing it. It's very rare that people will seriously talk about killing themselves only for dramatic effect. 

The sister seems to offer an opportunity for some insight. Send her a message thanking her for apology, ask her maybe to explain why everyone is so angry with you? I would tell her you're willing to stay away for the sake of your boyfriend's mental health if that's anyone's concern.  His dad's girlfriend would only tell me the note said he loves me. 

I already thanked her for her apology but she won't talk to me anymore. 

I'm not sure how I would have motivated it unless it was along the lines of him not wanting to cause me heartbreak anymore.. You could be on to something. 

But that makes me scared to attempt to contact him, as some other users are suggesting. what if he also doesn't want to hear from me? what if my call would make him feel worse?  I would send him a message telling him how you feel about him and telling him that you're there for him if he wants to lean on you. Leave it up to him to contact you.  I don't think I ever went a day without telling him that I'm there for him. I sent him a goodbye email but it's doubtful he'll get it anytime soon.  &amp;gt;What's the point in shutting me out?

You are not responsible for his disease. Get to an AlAnon meeting and get yourself right. [deleted] Not that it sounds like it'll make a difference as you have strong feelings about this, but AlAnon is for people who have loved ones who are addicted to something.  AA is for addicts themselves. They also have non-religious meetings in some places.

What you're going through sounds awful.  If you can, let a friend know what's going on so you have a support to get you through day-to-day things.  That's what's helped me in situations where I felt really really overwhelmed. I hope it can help you too. N-o.  [deleted] I'm an athiest and I love alanon.

Give yourself up to god a tl;dr way of saying "admit that you cannot control this situation, and that you cannot change the addict (or for AA you cannot remove the impulse to binge drink) in your life no matter what". For some people saying "it's in gods hands" is easier than saying "genetics made me this way". You're the first atheist I've heard say that so I'm going to go to a meeting. My brother's been an addict for 12 years and my deeply religious Aunt suggested I go a while back. I will give it a chance since it seems like it's really helped you? A lot of people need religion to cope with stressful situations like having a loved one suffering from addiction.  In general I have heard alanon is pretty accepting and not meant to push a religious agenda. That being said some groups may be a better fit for you than others.  Try a meeting.  If you feel the amount of religious stuff makes it less helpful then try a different meeting in a different location.   There is no religious agenda whatsoever. Your higher power is anything outside yourself that makes better choices than you have. If you're in AA or AlAnon, you don't have to work hard to find a dozen examples. I guess I was unclear.  I did not mean that alanon had a religious agenda at all, just that some meetings may have people more relate-able than others.  My point as not to give up if the first meeting didn't help, more time or a different group of people might be more helpful than others.

Just being around people who "got it" was a huge comfort. In my current situation I'm unable to get a meeting, and I really miss it, but I can take the things I learned there and apply them to my life now.

As lizzyborden42 said, some groups are religion heavy, if you find one that's like that just try a different meeting. My main group would close with a prayer at the end of the meeting. Me and a few others just had a "moment of silence" no one ever objected. I'd love to meet other people who "get it!" I'm looking forward to my first meeting. Thanks for the tips. I really appreciate the guidance. =) No problem, I hope it brings you happiness and peace!

Just a heads up, I cried at my first meeting. A lot of people do, most meetings have tissues available, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Thanks for the heads up. That's good to know. I bet it's very cathartic to meet people in similar situations.
Edit: looks like I'll be going to Nar-Anon since my brother's an addict. Oh it's so great, hearing everyone's stories, and relating to their struggles. Seeing people in my situation who'd come out for the positive, and were living happy lives.  My guess - They are sad, angry and scared.  They have to blame someone and right now they can't blame him or themselves, so you're the next best thing.  It's not fair.  I'm sorry.  Suicide attempts are hard on everyone.  I'm so sorry.  I hope he recovers.  Oh, I'm so sorry! That's horrible of them!!

It's a long shot, but try calling the hospital for information and explain what's happened - that you're his girlfriend, you're worried and his family is blaming you for what happened and that you're desperate to know how he is.

**/HUG** I can't call the hospital because they never told me *what* hospital he's in. 

Thanks though.  Ring around.

Cripes, if that was my husband, I'd call every single hospital in the city if I had to (which, here amounts to all of maybe 3, but that's not the point!).

Start with the ones closest to his home and work outwards from there.

Plus, imagine what that would sound like to him when someone tells him "hey, your girlfriend rang. She had to call (number of hospitals) to find you!". His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I *did* find him. Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family? Hospitals have different rules about that.  They may not be able to say anything, but it's worth a try to call around.  If they say they can't tell you, you can ask them to deliver a message to call you to that patient (not his family) if at all possible and some of them will do that if you don't try to make them tell you if they have someone there by that name.  

Another possibility is to try his friends.  Do you know anybody you could call that would know or be able to call the family and ask what hospital he's in? His family hates any outside "influence." his friends? me. that's it and the only reason they allowed me around was because he put up a fight. he couldn't be around his friends because he couldn't drink or do drugs which is all anyone does. we were each other's sober friend. 

I want to try the hospital thing, but I don't think I clearly understand what you're saying...  When you call the hospital, the person may be able to look at their computer and know whether or not he's there.  They just might not be able to give you that information.  Sometimes, if they say they can't tell you, you can say that you understand that but if it's possible, could they take your name and number and have a message delivered for that patient to contact you?  Sometimes they'll do that, because that way they don't have to break their rules by confirming whether or not that patient is at that hospital. His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I *did* find him. Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family? &amp;gt;His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I did find him

That's not up to them.

&amp;gt;Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family?

I'm not sure, but it's SO worth trying. No, if he's considered mentally incompetent, or worse, if he's in a coma of some sort or something, they are very very important. They get to make the decisions when he can't because they've got power of attorney if he hasn't explicitly and legally given it to somebody else.

And HIPAA isn't going to let them give out any medical information to her unless he has authorized it. Surely they could state what his condition is if nothing else, though? Just "he's still critical" or "he's stable" or whatever? From my understanding, no. They have to be authorized to give any medical information to anyone. Of course, I'm fuzzy on it because the last time I was trained on HIPAA, so maybe? But I don't think so.

They *may* be able to confirm that he is there and what room he's in, depending on hospital policy, but that's really it. &amp;gt;His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I did find him

That's not up to them.

&amp;gt;Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family?

I'm not sure, but it's SO worth trying. Are you sure it's not up to them whether he can take phone calls? they wouldn't try to ask who is calling for him and shut me down if the doctors said who I was? Are you sure it's not up to them whether he can take phone calls? they wouldn't try to ask who is calling for him and shut me down if the doctors said who I was? how old is he?  twenty one. We both are. His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I *did* find him. Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family? No they are not.  In the USA, we have a law called HIPAA.  This is about privacy.  Unless you are next of kin (in his case, his parents) - you don't get anything.  It's the law of the USA.  

Don't try to get someone fired just because you want information.  When you are his legal wife, you can get information.  Until then, no.  "legal wife" .. please don't make me puke. Guess I'll just have to put up. this is one of the biggest reasons that gay marriage is a big deal.  This is one of the rights that legal marriage gives you.  Living together, does not give you this right at all.  

Common-law - well, anecdotal evidence only, but when my former f-i-l's girlfriend of over 20 years was in a car wreck and brain damaged, it took over 2 weeks for him to try and prove common-law marriage in our state so he could visit her in the hospital. Sorry. I don't believe in marriage period. It's a shitty way to "prove" a relationship. Fuck that system because quite honestly, anyone should be allowed to see anyone unless they're the fucking shooter.  His family probably wouldn't let me speak to him if I *did* find him. Are hospitals even allowed to tell me how he is if I'm not direct family? it's worth a shot to ask to talk with him directly and have the call transferred into his room.  Ring around.

Plus, imagine what that would sound like to him when someone tells him "hey, your girlfriend rang. She had to call (number of hospitals) to find you!".   How the fuck is this your fault?  They were the ones in contact with him more than you!  You should be yelling at them for not helping him!  Hope he recovers and gets help with his depression.  A co-worker of my bf killed herself a couple of years ago.  She was pretty, successful, seemed to have a caring family, had a cute boyfriend and a career.  She killed herself because depression fucks you up and tells you that despite all these things, you don't matter and life doesn't matter.  Life becomes like a game that you hate to play but you are forced to play it day after day after day.  There seems to be only one way to escape.  That can't be solved by one person no matter how much you love them.  His family needs to own up to the fact that they were too preoccupied with their own lives to get help for him.  Don't lay down and take their shit! I really did want to yell at them. Had a whole thing typed out and everything... Then I realized I couldn't be an asshole because they probably already realize it themselves.     How did you manage to take fault for cancer? How did you manage to take fault for cancer? I really hope you're not that thick. What? How can you blame yourself for *giving someone cancer*? (Not possible, by the way, in case you *are* that thick)  I'm so sorry you have to go through this. This thread is full of good advice, I just am adding to take it one day at a time. Take care of yourself, and hopefully details will come to light in due time. His family sounds like they're free-falling, as the dust settles hopefully they'll let you in. Hang in there, it won't be easy but we're here. I'm pretty certain they'll never let me in. They've hated anyone who has entered their baby's life. I was a drug user myself when we met, but something clicked back in November and I stopped completely. they don't believe me for a second and they can go to hell because I've worked my ass off to stay clean, not only for my boyfriend, but also for myself. and they don't want to accept it? fine. my boyfriend will contact me if he's allowed a phone.... I just don't know when that'll be, if ever.  You don't need people like that in your life, they sound like a nightmare. How old is your boyfriend? twenty one. and they are nightmarish people. me and my boyfriend were very entrenched in reddit culture. they are the kind of people reddit glares at. 

edit: I don't mean to be chalking up the reddit-elitism right now. But truth is, we met on reddit, spent many hours on reddit... It was just a thing we did before we even met. Sorry. I didn't mean for it to come off that way. And I'm just trying to find a description that is easily understood. Figured a reddit analogy on reddit would work..  I'm pretty certain they'll never let me in. They've hated anyone who has entered their baby's life.

I just don't know when that'll be, if ever.       And this is one of the reasons why I haven't made an honest effort to kill myself.  I could not leave my family and friends with something like this.  I wouldn't want anyone else to be in pain because of my general fucked up brain chemicals.  So I just live with it.

As someone who has been there though, not wanting to burden the ones around you is a very real thing.  It's nothing to place blame on.  I don't tell many people anymore because it drives people away.  If they really knew what was going on in my head, and if I really shared my true feelings, i would have zero friends other than the three long distance ones I have now.  Trust me though, it's not you.  The family will settle down after a while.  I wouldn't be surprised if they apologize at some point.  (if they're good people in a stressful situation that is)     go to the hospital and see him in person. I know it's far away and it takes a lot of courage after everything you've gone through, but it might clear your head if you actually see him and talk with the family in person. Best of luck xoxo go to the hospital and see him in person. I know it's far away and it takes a lot of courage after everything you've gone through, but it might clear your head if you actually see him and talk with the family in person. Best of luck xoxo  I can tell you it is NOT your fault. Even if he did say something about not wanting to be a burden to you. My mom has used that one on me my WHOLE life (now 21).  I have come to realize, and it took me 20 years to do so, It is NEVER my fault. It doesn't matter what you do, it is not your fault. Him feeling that way, and deciding to try and kill himself is a chemical imbalance. 
 I understand that you don't want to talk to a counselor, so at least KEEP talking to someone. Even if it is to the people of reddit. That is another thing I have learned, to just tell someone. I have had a...well I lot of crap happened to and around me when I was younger, the more I talk about it, the batter I feel. 
I hope that the family realizes this is not your fault and tells you more about how he is doing. Maybe he will insist on seeing you.  I think the encouragement over this thread has finally convinced me to go to the counseling center tomorrow. Thank you so much for your kind words.

PS. I see you feel *batter* when you talk about it. What's it like to feel like baking materials smashed up together in a bowl? (If you can't tell, I'm feeling a little better.)   NOT YOUR FAULT.

The decisions that he made were his, and his alone.

I hope that talking with a counselor helps you understand and believe that.

Stay strong.   You said it was the fathers girlfriend who said they never want to speak to you?  If you haven't already I would say get in contact with his father directly and try communicating with him if he will hear it.  Maybe she doesn't speak for their family.  And you said the sister already apologized so maybe they don't blame you? Although you probably know their feelings better than me, my advice is to still reach out to them.   All I can conclude is *that's* the reason she was speaking with me and not one of them. They don't want to talk to me, she's still a mid-person, so she agreed to talk to me because I'm also a girlfriend. Y'know? 

I've tried contacting his sister again. I was crying really bad because I got so afraid again that it was my fault after I started mulling over what he could have said in his goodbye note. Waiting to hear from her..    I've been in the exact same position as you. My fiancee tried to commit suicide last year and ended up in hospital for weeks. Her foster mother blamed it all on me because she couldn't see the missing link (which was in fact because my fiancee was being abused by her foster father). 

Remember that emotions are running high right now for everybody involved and you may not get an apology and they may not come around. Do not listen to what they say - they are angry and hurt and confused and want answers to a question that possibly even your boyfriend can't answer. You need to focus on yourself right now. More than anything, I want to know what HE thinks. I don't want to be shut out by them before I hear from him. I began to cry as his dad's girlfriend said she couldn't tell me what his note said and she hurriedly got off the phone with a, "you take care of yourself." NO! I want to talk to my boyfriend! not you, you little bitch. if this isn't my fault, why are they so hellbent on cutting me out? not giving two shits whether I'm suffering? I'm not even in the town, I'm in the middle of my last semester at college and they're just like "no, you get nothing. we know you put so much of your time into our son or brother. we know he opened up to you more than anyone else in his life. but bye forever!" FUCKFUCK FUCK THAT.  Is he in the hospital right now? Chances are he's not in any state to talk to anybody yet. Don't take it personally. I know it's shit and hard but you have to be patient. When it happened to me I was three hundred miles away from my fiancee visiting my parents and I had received a suicide note from her; I only knew that she had lived because her foster mother begrudgingly texted me a day later. You're going to have to wait it out and accept that you won't be able to know what's going on if you're not directly there, whether you think it's your right or not. I'm sure given time you will be able to speak to him but right now it's all raw. I'm 300 miles away, too. It's just so heart-wrenching especially since I'm only a girlfriend. No one has any right to tell me anything but I don't think it's too much to ask.

edit: yes, he's in the ICU. the only thing she told me was that he made it through the night but nothing more. it's not fair. I feel like a child throwing a tantrum but this is someone I deeply care about - a human being - not a toy that got broken.

(Rant)</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18a49a/women_with_degrees_make_bad_mothers_wtf_rant/</url><snippet>Today at work I over heard a man talking loudly and at length about how women with degrees make "bad mothers." This man continues on about how, in his experience "They can write reports but can't do any of the practical stuff." The worst part was that he was saying these things in front of his wife and two young daughters. I know for a fact the man he was talking to has a university educated sister-in-law who  has a new baby, but he was just quietly nodding to this guy, in front of his own wife! 

I angrily mentioned this to my supervisor whose wife is a teacher, (they have two daughters) and his only response was "Oh, different opinions."

I don't think anyone would ever accuse a man of being a worse father just because he has a degree! No one magically loses the ability to change diapers once they get a diploma! 

I would have loved to say something to this guy but it wouldn't have been appropriate at work. My coworker pointed out that at least this man has daughters who may eventually prove him wrong and change his mind rather than him poisoning sons with his BS.

I wish I lived in a world where these sorts of ideas were a thing of the past. :(

TL;DR Sexist troglodyte thinks women with degrees are bad at the practical aspects of parenting and proclaims it loudly in front of his wife and daughters.  Or he poisons his daughters into never reaching their full potential. :-(  That is what really worries me. &amp;gt; I would have loved to say something to this guy but it wouldn't have been appropriate at work.

If you let them keep spouting bullshit because you are scared of being inappropriate at work, they will keep thinking they are right.

I'm not a woman nor particularly militant in general, but if I hear people talking shit like that I just can't help but give them both barrels in return. If I am going to lose my job for that, it was a shitty place to work. It would have been inappropriate mainly because I'm a lifeguard and I couldn't stop watching the busy pool to give him hell. I still had to do my job and my somewhat sexist supervisor would have taken this guy's side if he complained about me.  &amp;gt; I would have loved to say something to this guy but it wouldn't have been appropriate at work.

If I am going to lose my job for that, it was a shitty place to work.  He might have a point. I remember clearly the day I was handed my BS degree. The moment I picked it up from the table, I suddenly and inexplicably hated children and anything related to childcare.

Oh wait, no, that didn't happen. He's dumb.  He might have a point. I remember clearly the day I was handed my BS degree. The moment I picked it up from the table, I suddenly and inexplicably hated children and anything related to childcare.

Oh wait, no, that didn't happen. He's dumb.   Well jerks like him certainly make bad fathers.      There is one thing I've learned working with a boss who sucks the Fox News/Tin Foil Hat teat: Most of the time it's not worth getting worked up over the dumb shit they say.

They do a fantastic job showing what an asshole nutter they are themselves; you don't have to help them dig their holes. Now, should you be confronted by him and he starts spewing this crap, by all means let him have it. Other wise you will be much happier spending your energy on encouraging young girls to attain their education goals. Undermining these kinds of assholes at the source is much more rewarding.      I'd like to think that maybe his wife doesn't have a degree and she was feeling bad about it so he was trying to cheer her up? Maybe? I hope? It's still an awful thing to say, but it maybe had decent intentions.     I was once told that I would never be a "woman" until I learned how to bake bread and sew buttonholes.  Guess my husband and I add up to a single woman.  He bakes bread, I sew buttonholes. I was once told that I would never be a "woman" until I learned how to bake bread and sew buttonholes.  I've knitted one button hole and had to undo it because I went wrong. I can make cakes but think bread is a waste of time. Can I request half woman status? I was once told that I would never be a "woman" until I learned how to bake bread and sew buttonholes.  I am so sorry! That's terrible!           </snippet></document><document><title>Love and a Tortoise: I thought you ladies would like it.</title><url>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/fashion/a-writers-tortoise-leads-the-way-to-happiness-modern-love.html?ref=fashion&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;</url><snippet>  Tortoises aside, I think the message here about finding who partner who not only gets your quirks but likes them is so essential.

This article has inspired me to get my shit together and actually go out and get one. Thanks! I had a russian tortoise with an ex, ex got to keep him.  But I loved that bugger.  Go for it. Im just at a point where Im ready for a long term relationship and think its about time I was responsible for someone else. naturally that led me to getting a tortoise. 

Going out tomorrow to buy all supplies and hopefully will have my new companion by the end of the week.  Research based on that sort of tortoise you want.  My russian we kept in a large tuperware because glass would stress them out.  My friend had a box turtle that they kept in a rabbit hutch.  

I loved my russian, strictly vegetarian meant I didn't have to worry about worms or anything, and could grow my own food.  And I didn't have to worry about him getting big like an Indian star that I initially wanted to buy.  And LOTS of character!  He would sleep in my hoodie.
 I'm about 95% sure I will get a Russian. I've been meaning to start eating vegetarian more often for health reasons and I think it'd help a great deal if I could prepare my meals alongside my tortoises. Also in 5th grade my class pet was a Russian Tortoise named Irene and she was my introduction to tortoise care and she was wonderful! She was already pretty old when I met her but I hope shes still going strong.  Im just at a point where Im ready for a long term relationship and think its about time I was responsible for someone else. naturally that led me to getting a tortoise.

Do your research, but I had a beautiful Hermann's West tortoise named Harry Truman (a female) for 5 years until my mother accidentally killed her. 

 I love that name. I plan to name mine Socrates ( im a philosophy major) unless they have something striking about them that calls for another name.   Tortoises and turtles make excellent pets. I had a red-eared slider who was a great friend. I used to wash his shell with a soft little brush from time to time and he LOVED it. Turtle Spa Day was his favorite day. He also liked to be petted--he'd stretch his neck waaaay out so I could rub under his chin. He also knew when it was time to eat and would beg for food like a dog or a cat. 

However, I wouldn't recommend a water turtle unless you have the resources to raise one. A healthy turtle requires ten gallons of water for every inch his shell measures. They are also eating and poo-ing machines, and you need to do a lot to keep their habitats clean. BUT... beyond all that, my turtle was an excellent pet and a great friend.

I would expect they could feel vibrations like when someone taps on the end of one of my nails, but A brush wouldn't produce many. Wait, they can feel their shells?

As a young girl, I had a tortoise named Mort. He lived in my backyard. He would hibernate in the winter and burrow in the ground and not come out until Spring. He loved strawberries and corn on the cob. He would walk around SUPER fast and get really excited when anyone went to the backyard to play with him. 

We had some problems with our pool one summer, and we had a pool guy come do a consultation. He was instantly fascinated with our tortoise. He came back on a weekday while my family was at school/work to do his work with our pool. When we got home, Mort was gone. The pool man stole him. :(

When we called the pool company, we were told that the guy quit that day, and in a bizarre, tragic twist, apparently that man didn't even give his pool company his real name, so they couldn't find him. :( this was before employment laws were as strict as they are now, and I do remember that this man had a foreign accent. I was 12 at the time, and I have a feeling a lot of the details of the story were kept from me.

I miss Mort every day, and this happened nearly 10 years ago. I hope that man is being kind to him. My tortoise was a breed that can live for decades...so I hope he is still alive and well and enjoying his life, wherever he is. Poor little guy. :(  I couldn't think of anything worse than having my beloved pets stolen :(
I'm sorry that happened to you.  &amp;gt;People told me about their dogs and cats who had died, and I thought, it&#8217;s easy to love the beautiful, the normal. But what about the gifts of loving the strange, the uncommon, the odd?

I couldn't help getting misty when I read \^that part. Loving something that seems out of the ordinary to others, whether it's a creature, or a hobby, or something else, can bring about strange reactions from the important people in our lives. And it's a shame, because we often need or want them to accept what we most care about.

That's one of the things that touched me about the story. The author's love for her pet was considered strange, and by extension, she was considered to be abnormal in some way because of it. Yet, that very 'oddness' turned out to be an effective measuring stick of sorts when it came to relationships.

The last few paragraphs had me smiling through tears. :) How wonderful to see the empathy and understanding in her husband's actions. Glad you posted this, OP! :) that was my favorite part of the story too. ugh, I'm going from teary-eyed to crying.   I'm in a glass case of emotion! RIP Minnie. Very touching story. Her husband sounds wonderful. We all need to remember that there is someone out there that will embrace our weirdness! every crooked pot has a crooked lid           Eating dinner with a tortoise at the table is pretty weird... I eat dinner on the bed with my pet rooster while we watch movies. I do that too, but I'd never let my boyfriend know I call him that. Lol! Good one, but I'm not kidding about the [rooster](http://cdn.backyardchickens.com/f/fb/900x900px-LL-fb31a79b_55594_100_0003.jpeg) Aww, he looks so happy! How do you deal with the poop?  He wears a [nappy](http://cdn.backyardchickens.com/f/f2/900x900px-LL-f2b2da31_100_0012.jpeg). My duck used to wear the same type of diapers! Miss him so much sometimes. :-( Aww, he looks so happy! How do you deal with the poop?  I eat dinner on the bed with my pet rooster while we watch movies. That sounds legit, but would you let the rooster sit on the table while you were having dinner with your SO? Eating dinner with a tortoise at the table is pretty weird...             Reading this makes me miss my red eared slider.    </snippet></document><document><title>I'm having a really hard time trying to get an IUD, advice please?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18by62/im_having_a_really_hard_time_trying_to_get_an_iud/</url><snippet>    I've never been on birth control before, but I've been doing some research over the past couple of months and decided that i wanted the Paragard IUD. A little over a month ago i went to planned parenthood and had a consolation. 
I'm 24 and uninsured. I'm currently employed full time as a server at a bar, but i get paid under the table, so I don't have proof of income, which made it difficult for them to determine a sliding scale price for me. So, I applied for the select plan for women (http://echealthinsurance.com/pennsylvania-health-insurance/pe    nnyslvania-public-health-insurance-plans/select-plan-for-women/).
When we were finishing up they told me to call them when I started my next menstrual cycle so that I could schedule a time for me come in and have the IUD inserted. 
So, a week ago when I got my period I gave them a call, the woman I spoke with said that my application hadn't gone through yet (which they told me is unusual because it's normally processed in under 30 days). So it'd cost me anywhere from $300-$900 to get the IUD. 
I'm sorry that this post is such a mess, I'm stressed out and can't seem to get in contact with anyone who can give me advice or any information about how I can get this sorted out.

   There are planned parenthood's in Pennsylvania. They should have either a payment plan or a low cost option for the IUD.

Edit: My bad, I didn't see your scrolly text! I think your best bet might be to get pills until your application goes through. Pills will be much cheaper if you have to pay for them yourself. </snippet></document><document><title>Today, I tried life-draw modelling for the first time - and loved it!</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18cd6o/today_i_tried_lifedraw_modelling_for_the_first/</url><snippet>I was certainly nervous, but after the first five minutes it wasn't bad at all.

Do you have any advice for those interested in doing it as well?  Wow, what a coincidence! I did figure modeling for an art class today, too (first time for this class, second time ever). High five!  As an artist I totally respect people that can model well.  If I were the model, all the easels/pads would look like blurry messes with me constantly fidgeting.
