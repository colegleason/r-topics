You are quoted as saying: \"\u201cI would say 99 percent of my constituency, those who have contacted me, is against gay marriage...My job is to represent my constituents and uphold what they believe.\u201d\n\nFirst, exaggeration fools nobody. It is statistically impossible that so many of your constituents agree with you, especially in county that voted heavily Democrat in the previous Presidential election. You know this.

Morality, misguided or otherwise, has no place as the basis for deciding a person's worth as a citizen and a human being; otherwise, what are we left with besides tyranny of the (incredibly slim yet vocal) majority? When gay marriage is legalized it will not be because it is a right grudgingly given, but rather a long-standing oppression finally removed. There is a difference.\n\nWhat consoles me and, I suspect, gay people across the state and around the country, is that despite your obstruction, it simply doesn't matter very much in the long run. Gay marriage will be legal nationwide, and soon. Those who oppose it are simply on the wrong side of history, and every day of delay may be disappointing, insulting, painful...but nothing more than that: a delay. Human dignity and love will win out, and you'll be left to explain your support of intolerance to your grandchildren.\n\nAs I said before, expect many more emails along these lines.

This is a great letter but have you checked that he is actually your representative? If he isn't, even the best letters will make no real difference.\n\nAdam Brown represents the 102nd district which is far west Champaign (west of Duncan). Most of Champaign-Urbana is the 103rd district and our representative is Naomi Jakobsson, who is a democrat and in my opinion a pretty neat lady overall.  This is a noble effort, but misguided. His statement could be accurate, as he may represent more rural members of the community. Odds are, you aren't his constituents because \n\na: most of you are only temporary residents of Champaign-Urbana for school.\n\nb: if you want to make the argument that state representatives should represent even temporary residents, most of you are probably covered by Naomi Jakobsson - who has already agreed to sign it. \n\nHer page is here, if you'd like to show your support - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Representative-Naomi-Jakobsson/109442605763187?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts        Full disclosure: After posting this I tried to figure out how Brown, a Republican, could have ever been elected from CU.

Safety first and don't be a dumbass, I don't want to see any of you awesome dudes in hospital or handcuffs.\n\n2. If you are under 21, stay away from Green street, its crawling with cops and you can't get into bars now.\n\n3. If you can, buy alcohol off campus. Its significantly cheaper. If you're &lt; 21 and looking for someone to buy for you, ask someone to buy today or early tomorrow, nobody is going to want to buy stuff for other people on Friday.\n\n4. Walk in groups. Crime happens, and there's no easier target than a lone drunkard. Know the numbers of the campus PD and saferides/walks \n\n5. [this](http://i.imgur.com/rdIBH.jpg) gives some great help for dealing with cops and general safety (thanks /u/Helpful_guy).\n\n***\n\n&gt; Being drunk doesn't mean your behavior gets excused by everyone.\n\n\n&gt; Pace yourself. Eat lots. Don't forget about drinking water every once in a while to stay hydrated.\n\n\n&gt; Dont do simple dumb things, remember the age old rule \"Do one illegal thing at a time\" aka dont j-walk, climb shit, litter, etc.\n\n\n&gt; Another big thing is if you have a party to make sure no randoms are coming in. I was at a house party that was busted at Polar Bear (SIUC) this winter and the undercover cop was a woman posing as a sorostitute (minding she was a solid 8.5) so don't assume that kind of trickery does not happen here.\n\n\n&gt; I don't have any tips but the people who really lick their chops over unofficial are the tow truck drivers.

Apart from my own money and some help from my parents, I was actually able to snag a few scholarships. \n\n* The honors program awarded me $1,000 for the trip. Thanks, CHP.\n* I don't know which office you'll go through, but I studied through IPENG and thus was able to do a fellowship. I got half my airfare covered in exchange for a few volunteer hours and making a tri-fold poster for them to use at study abroad fairs. Things like that may not be available for short programs like what you want to do, but check with whichever office you use to see if they have anything like that.\n* The I4I scholarships are great. I got one for $500 for having a \"unique destination,\" but there are a whole bunch others. Check those out! Apply for them all!\n\nGood luck! kinda a tangent, but how did you like the program? That's actually one of the programs I'm looking at, but I'm trying to gauge if it's worth a couple thousand in addition to a normal tuition year. i'm pretty apathetic about credits, i'm just looking to have a good experience over a summer (or semester) because I've never left the US. It was absolutely fantastic! None of us really knew any Japanese before we went there except a few phrases we'd picked up from anime, but we had a phenomenal Japanese teacher at HIT (the Japanese university), and immersion did wonders for us. (I came back knowing more than enough to test out of JAPN 201 here.) We also took a culture class and a few small engineering seminars that would meet anywhere from once the whole trip or twice a week. We were also able to shadow some of HIT's clubs -- we got to try out kendo, tea ceremony, taiko, and tons more.\n\nThey also took us on weekend outings . We took a day trip to Miyajima where we saw SO MANY DEER and got to climb (for many of us) our first mountain. Another weekend, we went to the city and saw the atomic bomb memorial and museum at the Peace Park. And yet another time we got to visit an okonomiyaki sauce factory and try our hand at making our own okonomiyaki. \n\n[Here's a photo of me climbing that mountain.](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/29322_401086946285_931246_n.jpg)\n\nWe also spent a ton of time shopping, going to karaoke, taking over arcades (seriously, 10 floors of games -- it was heaven), and drinking. We're still close with lots of the kids we met over there, and some of the Japanese kids have studied abroad here to get their own experience. \n\n**tl;dr** Program was AMAZING and I wish I had time and money to go back. Any more questions, ask away. :)   My sister is in Europe now. She worked. She also got scholarships but for the most part she used several years of her savings because it's a once in a lifetime thing. Pretty sure she's been to near twenty countries in her time there.

Yes, IMAX screens are larger, but can vary from theater to theater. What makes IMAX different is that they use larger film, with different cameras and projectors that lead to larger screen images and higher resolutions.

You call them and say some people shouted racial slurs from a moving vehicle? Are the cops going to try to find them and chase them in a police car? If they catch them, what will they do? Give them a warning or a ticket? Will they be charged with a crime? What crime? Will it be a misdemeanor? It's probably not worth your time to deal with people like that.

Farm boys. Get out once in awhile. Nothing to do in the winter. Harmless. As generalizing as this comment is; there is some truth to it.

Now you're just being racially intolerant of farm boys. It's not the same thing. Yes, anyone on meth is dangerous. However, when that person attacks you because of your race it means you are exposed to danger for your appearance not because you are anybody. What does any of this have to do with farms? There's a stereotype that people from rural areas are racially intolerant. I.e, farm boys will shout racial slurs at you from truck windows.  That's my point, lets stop racial intolerance by perpetuating other racial stereotypes, great plan!

We can have a group for every political belief on the planet, every stance on religion, every viewpoint ever. But we cannot have a club that promotes exercising and physical health. The logic is very flawed (unless you consider the constitution but still) . Sure there is a lot of head trauma in boxing but that is in actual fights. You rarely ever get put on your ass training. I see more injuries in football than I do in boxing. Yeah, go figure.  I think the rationale was that it wasn't \"cultured\" enough or some bs like that.

I see more injuries in football than I do in boxing. In football you have people paid to professionally monitor it all. With Boxing it may be that the school feels that if someone sustains(just one person) a serious injury......the school would be blamed.  The University is not affiliated with any RSO's on campus. If someone were to get injured during boxing the head of the RSO and its board members would be held accountable. All you have to do is make the members sign a contract saying that the RSO will not be held accountable and the the participants accepts all risks. Same thing I had to do in high school for boxing. Though while they have legal distance, anything done by their students on school property still comes back to them. Though there probably still is more to it though.

How is Orchard South? I would not recommend Orchard South. Depending on where you live in OS, the laundry building could be 4 blocks away. If you want to live in OD, choose an apartment close to one of the two laundry buildings. If you are going to be here for a couple of years, something on-campus like Goodwin-Green, or something with one of the better landlords (Advantage, Bailey) might be a better idea with regard to ease of getting to classes, being on several bus routes, etc.\n\nHowever, if you are an international student, depending on the country you are from, Orchard Downs might be a better place to stay if you don't know anyone here or there aren't many people from your country.

It may or may not be nicer in terms of the rental units, but it is also more expensive and gets a nasty rumble every few minutes from passing freight. How much is it for a room at Indigo Place? Looks highend.... I think its between 300-500 ish per room, depending on the number of rooms. I have a 3 bedroom to myself (with my wife) for about 1100 a month. This works out to less than 400/room. Oh, ok. Not as expensive as I thought it would be. The reviews I've seen online are a mixed bag, some people are really pleased with the place, others loathe it. I guess the bad reviews are from before the renovations....  Anything from Advantage Properties is good, if you want to check out the local landlords.

If it's putting off detectable amounts of heat, it's gotta bump the power consumption out of spec. mA required is passed over the USB bus IIRC.  What? How do they use thermal imaging to check for keyloggers? We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them.

Is it beneficial to be a part of a sorority or a waste of time? From what I know about the university, it's pretty big into Greek life. Are most people on campus involved in it? Any thoughts? \n   I feel like I can help out a lot here. I'm a physics major and in a house. Seeing as my classes are mainly guys I wanted a way that I could make friends with a lot of girls. I know a lot of people will talk about how being in a house is a \"waste of time\" but its not. Most sororities will have test files where you can look at notes, quizzes, labs, exams and all sorts of helpful information from semesters before. This has helped me out a great deal with homework for whenever I seem to get stuck. The other thing that most people don't understand is that you have to hit a minimum gpa to be in a house. The girls all want you to succeed and so homework and exams will always come before sorority life. \n\nNot even just the school life, but being in a sorority is a great place for networking. I have been offered jobs and promotions from other sisters who are no longer in college. The opportunities gained from being in a house alone makes it worth it. \n\nThis university is really big on greek life, and on a campus a large as our school, being in a house will honestly make the campus feel smaller. I have made so many friends in other houses (both sorority and frat) and its nice being able to walk around campus and run into people you know. \n\nFrats and sororities are super involved in volunteering and raising money for various causes. Most people know little about this. We raised over $10,000 in a semester for our philanthropy. Not to mention we go and read to children every week as well as other supplemental things like working in soup kitchens, clothing drives, and habitat for humanity trips.\n\nNot to mention but being in a house is just fun. We do a lot of activities together like sit down hang out and watch movies, pull pranks on each other, going out, random walmart runs, getting ready for events together and so much more. We're all normal human beings, we just happen to live in a house together. \n\nThere are so many different houses on campus, 18 now and a possibility of 19 next year. There is a unique personality to each house and if its something you're interested in you're bound to fit into one of them!

You seem completely normal and unlike girls from what people consider to be \"top houses\". Shame my house never does anything with anyone but houses I don't like.\n\nWhen it comes to rushing both fraternities and sororities, a lot of people get turned off from it because they see how the people in the \"top houses\" act, and figure that if that's the top, then the ones beneath can't be good. But they're all wrong, because first of all, there are still plenty of great people in top houses, they just aren't seen as much. Secondly the other houses are usually more grounded and aren't all assholes which is the stereotype for guys, and fake for girls. I feel like I can help out a lot here.

The fact that the university doesn't crack down on what is obviously cheating is beyond me. Frats/sororities do not hold to any standard of academic integrity at all. And the minimum GPA is not something all that hard to keep.It's not like you feel pressured to keep that GPA. What's your house's minimum GPA, out of curiosity? \n\nThe job network is rather convenient and does have obvious benefits.

Talk to professors, take advantage of research opportunities, get involved in your department.

It is nice that greek life contributes to \"supplemental things\", but if those \"things\" are really important to you then you shouldn't need to join greek life to participate. Anyone can work in a soup kitchen or run a clothing drives. (Plus, I still firmly believe that habitat for humanity is just a way for a bunch of spoiled kids to have a morally fulfilling vacation in a town. There is nothing unemployed people in New Orleans can't to do build a house that your sorority can, sorry. If anything you're just stealing the jobs and local resources they have.)\n\nThe whole fun paragraph is nothing unique to greek life at all. I guess that was the point of typing it out, but chilling, pranking, buying shit, and pregaming are normal parts of college lifestyle for everyone. However, something not everyone has is the vindictive jealousy that goes with sorority sisters within their own house and at girls in other houses. So be wary of that.\n\nI'm not anti-greek. I have a lot of friends in top houses and I know it's a big part of life here. But I *hate* how the information they give out to draw in new members is skewed. The best piece of advice heander gave you, OP, was give it a try. See if you like it, but be aware that very few girls ever drop out of a pledge class and I don't really want to imagine how their ex-pledge sisters are to them. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Congrats on your acceptance.  I don't disagree with you iam0594. You made a lot of good points! But at the same time any time a person gives their opinion on a subject it will be skewed. I have a bias to being in a sorority because I love being in a house. \n\nI agree that the university is not on top of their game when it comes to \"cheating\" but I know of people who have access to old tests and quizzes just like I do, but instead of getting it from sisters or brothers they get information from friends. I have several GDI friends who pass around all of their information from previous semesters to their friends. How is that any different? I'm just explaining that being in a house has helped me with my school work. My house has a min. GPA of 2.6 (I think?) but some houses have a 3.0 requirement. \n\nWhen it comes to philanthropy when we raised money last semester it was from dinners, ice cream bar and a football tournament. All the money raised was from other students on campus. We weren't asking for donations from our alumni. And I never said that you had to join a house to volunteer and raise money, its just one of that added perks of being in a house. \n\nThe fun paragraph isn't unique to greek life. I completely agree with you on that one, but it is something that I love about being in my house. Any time someone wants you to join a club they're going to list out the benefits of being in a club. This is no different with me and my house. I love the volunteering aspect, I love hanging out, I love being able to go ask older girls in the house for help with school. While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek. \n\nYou are also correct, very few girls drop out once they're actually in the house. Where most girls drop out is during the actual rush experience.  &gt; While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek.\n\nRight, and I totally get and appreciate that. I'm not trying to bash you or sorority lifestyles at all. \n\nI'm pretty sure that you'd agree with me that in order for someone in a house to get access to previous tests and homeworks is much easier than it is for someone not in a house. So I guess in a way the main reason they are different is because of how readily available you have access to material you shouldn't. I know lots of people end up with stuff like that anyways and that professors usually change their material to prevent that from being an issue, but I feel like it's more implicit within a house. And not like that's necessarily a bad thing, I could use some answers for my engineering classes myself. But it is present and that's that.\n\nI'm very critical of philanthropy anyways so sorry to sound like I was attacking you on that. \n\nAnd yeah absolutely on you just listing the good sides of joining a sorority. If my sister were to come here and want to join a sorority I would likely tell her she absolutely should. I don't have broad, generalized notions anything against the people in them at all. Sorry if I came of as harsh! I was just defending why I love being in my house, but I can come off too strong to often!  Nope, you were one of the most respectable posters I've seen on here. I refuse to accept your apology.  Can I ask why we're banning Moruitelda? They had an [internet fight](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18sncm/ruiuc_where_do_you_feel_unsafe_around_campus/c8hu294). Juicy. They should fight irl. I'd watch.

I'm not in a sorority (dropped after the first day of recruitment, too much \"ra ra sisterhood\" for me), but one of my best friends is. Her biggest complaint to me is that her sisters get kinda catty and jealous if she hangs out with non-house members too often. I personally need lots of time alone. I don't know your personality, but it seems like theres always something you have to participate in in a sorority, which sounds like hell to me. I think that all depends on the house! My house encourages hanging out with non house members. We like being individuals, and by joining other clubs and hanging out with other friends you do just that. Just because you join a house doesn't mean that those girls have to be you're only friends.          It depends on what type of person you are. There are alpha-girl (ultra bitchy, extremely attractive) sororities and there are more average-joe girl sororities. If you can get along with these girls and want to spend a lot of your time with them, +12,000$$, go for it.\n I only know of one sorority that's that expensive. For the most part, they run from $3000-$6000/yr Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n It depends on what type of person you are.

Downvoted because the truth hurts. No, downvoted because the idea of being \"popular\" because you are in a frat / sorority at a university of &gt;40k students is a relatively bizarre one.

Personally, I think it's a lot cooler to make your friends based on interest/personality rather than buy them. But I'm an unpopular god damn independent person so what do I know.  You don't buy your friends when you join greek life. The money goes towards benefiting both the individual and the community. But you wouldn't know that because you probably just judge it based on the actions of a few stupid frat boys and a few catty sorority girls who don't accurately represent greek life as a whole. Well, I chose not to pursue that lifestyle. You don't think kids join that bologna to make new friends when they come to school? It's the same reason people join clubs is to meet new people but they usually don't have to shove out a couple grand for it every so often. However, yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about after being here around these people for six years, having dated someone in a frat, and being friends with people from frats and sororities. God, I'm an idiot! Get a life, me.  I didn't say its for everyone or blame you for not joining it. I didnt tell you to get a life. I was simply pointing out that you are make a rude false assumption about something you aren't apart of.

Ticket prices on Suburban have already rose, there gonna sky rocket now. They were 20$ last year and now the cheapest is 28$ in advance. The peak pricing bullshit is like 35. Its cheaper to drive vs take the bus at 35. i just got 2 amtrak tickets for $28. amtrak + metra will run me no more than $40 for a round trip. switch to amtrak if possible Amtrak is 38$ one way to Union Station... if you wanna buy tickets 3 months in advance then its $20. Plus metra = Over 80$ if its not in advance. Thats a lukewarm deal even at 20$ since Metra is an additional ~$5. Plus afaik amtrak only runs twice a day to chicago.

I have a bus ticket from LEX to go to O'Hare for break this month! Do you guys think I should get one from another company or that LEX will be back?  As of Friday night, Lex seems to be selling some trips during move-out, and not much else. They must be hiring buses from someone else or something. They must think they've come up with a really f'ing clever solution.\n\nRandom Thoughts:\n\n- It is probably not a good idea for LEX to thumb its nose at DOT. That will not increase LEX's probability of being invited to resume operations, regardless of what the 600 pages, which the LEX dog apparently ate, have to say.\n\n- If you buy a ticket from LEX at this point, you are a fool. They have probably collected $50k-$100k in revenue for trips they have not yet operated. It's unlikely they have liquid assets sufficient to meet final payroll and provide refunds for everyone. So if you bought a ticket before this all went down, you're probably not getting a refund. But there's nothing you can do. Buying a ticket now, however, would be extremely foolish. You're already on notice that LEX cannot operate! If you buy a ticket now, you are just throwing money down a hole.\n\n- The reason LEX is shut down is that they have CHRONIC maintenance and compliance issues. No pile of excuses, not even 600 pages worth, can possibly cancel out LEX's history with DOT. LEX is foolish for holding out hope that DOT will give them a reprieve.\n\n- DOT is engaged in political theatre. Quinn sent LaHood a letter asking that DOT investigate IL bus companies, so that he looks like he cares that Megabus keeps killing IL citizens (3 in the last year or so). LaHood has responded by sending out a posse, with the goal of taking VISIBLE, media-friendly action against some bus companies. According to FOX32, they went after Megabus and LEX. Megabus carries thousands, employs hundreds, has deep pockets and has probably made some nontrivial political contributions. LEX, on the other hand, is a little \"downstate\" cockroach with no connections. So, if you want to make an example of someone, who you gonna go after? LEX, of course. LEX is being sacrificed at the Media Altar to make the public think that DOT is effective and the public is safe. Shutting down LEX is a nice, tidy melodrama for the public, with no potential backlash for DOT.\n\n- As for Suburban, their website has suddenly lost a lot of its personality. The bad check page is gone, avoid-lex.com is now a Viagara advertisement, and I heard the owner was at a spa today. Just kidding about the last part. But maybe they're relieved that they don't have to duke it out with LEX anymore. As for me, I'm going to miss their entertaining posters. I never understood why people pretend to be offended - those posters are very funny, even the nasty ones.\n\n- I also noticed that the IL Shuttle website says something about reduced fares coming. Maybe they're going to crank up their frequency or run buses more frequently (rather than those big blue vans) or something which requires more riders. Think price elasticity...Econ 101.\n\n- Peoria is in trouble. If you google peoria charter winkler and look at articles and letter to the editor in the Peoria Journal Star, you'll find owner Winkler whining about how bad business has been (at least 2 articles) and asking oil companies to do their patriotic duty and reduce fuel prices. He seems like a dolt. His grandpa worked hard to build a business, and now he's doing a great job destroying it. They're circling the drain, IMHO. Everyone at Peoria has been sipping the \"we're great\" kool-aid without realizing that it's poison.\n\n- I imagine the main beneficiaries of the LEX shutdown, other than Suburban, will be Megabus and Slamtrak. Greyhound may get a little bump, but people seem to actively avoid their urine-soaked ghetto buses.\n\nBut what do I know...\n\n What about greyhound? What kind of econ TA misses a major competitor? I'm actually just a homeless person with a smartphone. Give me a break. Are you an Econ TA, or a homeless person with a smartphone? Or a homeless Econ TA with a smartphone? Doesn't the school pay you enough to make rent? Now I know what the GEO bargaining is about ... As of Friday night, Lex seems to be selling some trips during move-out, and not much else.

They have probably collected $50k-$100k in revenue for trips they have not yet operated. It's unlikely they have liquid assets sufficient to meet final payroll and provide refunds for everyone. So if you bought a ticket before this all went down, you're probably not getting a refund. But there's nothing you can do. Buying a ticket now, however, would be extremely foolish. You're already on notice that LEX cannot operate! If you buy a ticket now, you are just throwing money down a hole.\n\n- The reason LEX is shut down is that they have CHRONIC maintenance and compliance issues. No pile of excuses, not even 600 pages worth, can possibly cancel out LEX's history with DOT. LEX is foolish for holding out hope that DOT will give them a reprieve.\n\n- DOT is engaged in political theatre. Quinn sent LaHood a letter asking that DOT investigate IL bus companies, so that he looks like he cares that Megabus keeps killing IL citizens (3 in the last year or so). LaHood has responded by sending out a posse, with the goal of taking VISIBLE, media-friendly action against some bus companies. According to FOX32, they went after Megabus and LEX. Megabus carries thousands, employs hundreds, has deep pockets and has probably made some nontrivial political contributions. LEX, on the other hand, is a little \"downstate\" cockroach with no connections. So, if you want to make an example of someone, who you gonna go after? LEX, of course. LEX is being sacrificed at the Media Altar to make the public think that DOT is effective and the public is safe. Shutting down LEX is a nice, tidy melodrama for the public, with no potential backlash for DOT.\n\n- As for Suburban, their website has suddenly lost a lot of its personality. The bad check page is gone, avoid-lex.com is now a Viagara advertisement, and I heard the owner was at a spa today. Just kidding about the last part. But maybe they're relieved that they don't have to duke it out with LEX anymore. As for me, I'm going to miss their entertaining posters. I never understood why people pretend to be offended - those posters are very funny, even the nasty ones.\n\n- I also noticed that the IL Shuttle website says something about reduced fares coming. Maybe they're going to crank up their frequency or run buses more frequently (rather than those big blue vans) or something which requires more riders. Think price elasticity...Econ 101.\n\n- Peoria is in trouble. If you google peoria charter winkler and look at articles and letter to the editor in the Peoria Journal Star, you'll find owner Winkler whining about how bad business has been (at least 2 articles) and asking oil companies to do their patriotic duty and reduce fuel prices. He seems like a dolt. His grandpa worked hard to build a business, and now he's doing a great job destroying it. They're circling the drain, IMHO. Everyone at Peoria has been sipping the \"we're great\" kool-aid without realizing that it's poison.\n\n- I imagine the main beneficiaries of the LEX shutdown, other than Suburban, will be Megabus and Slamtrak. Greyhound may get a little bump, but people seem to actively avoid their urine-soaked ghetto buses.\n\nBut what do I know...\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.lincolnlandexpress.com/", "id": 758, "title": "LEX shuts down"}, {"snippet": "I'm sick of studying in my dorm room and the library.

I would really stress the importance of taking AP tests while you're still in high school. It's possible to pass out of a lot of these first year chem, physics and bio classes ( and possibly even gen-eds!) with AP credit and that allows you to take more interesting classes sooner rather than being bogged down with required classes that aren't as fun. Even if your GPA dips a little bit ( but not a lot!)  because of AP classes, it'll be worth it when you get here.  Exactly. Also, the more AP classes you take, the less classes you have to pay for. And student debt is one of the few debts that lasts until you pay it off, even bankruptcy does not eliminate it.   -Not a clue about tennis. Big 10 quality I guess? no idea\n\n-Your first year as an engineer will be retaking high school courses at a bit harder level. Physics, chem, calc, maybe bio. Your second year you will start taking some actual engineering major courses, and a few straight science. Junior and senior year will  be entirely engineering, more project/hard math focused. The difficulty of each year depends on the department. \n\n-There is no express minimum, your application is viewed holistically. The middle 50% of students usually scored about 1360 - 1480 on the SAT. Couldn't find any GPA stats, usually because most high schools do it differently. A word to the wise though, if you have good, interesting extra curriculars and you pop on paper, they don't care about your grades as much. I know I didn't get close to a 1360, and I got in. Also, apparently everyone writes their essays about legos, or taking apart electronics as a kid, so don't do that.  Haha, my favorite bullshit application essays are always crap from engineers and science majors that begin like \"Ever since I was young, I have always loved looking at the stars\" blah blah blah.

If the after hours/weekends access is anything like it is for Aero in Talbot, then you have to prove to your department (or their Technology Services department I believe) that you deserve after hours access.\n\nThen again, if you just want to go in there, there's nothing stopping you from going in there before they lock up and stay there till whenever you want to leave. Also, going in with someone else or when someone else walks in is all good too. As Vicodeen said, CS-only is not enforced at all. Yeah, I meant after hours access. Thanks for the reply.

I'm a General Engineer (that really wants to transfer to CS), and I don't know of any way to get i-card access.\n\nIt would be awesome to get access though! It's frustrating not being able to easily get in at odd hours. Are you an ACM member?  ACM can usually get members e-lock access to Siebel and to the office. Really? Are you sure?\n\nDo you know who I could contact to get this? I am part of ACM.   I'm a compE, and when I asked (repeatedly) a few years ago - I was consitently told no for two reasons \n1) Security risks (apparently CompE's are security risks)\n2) It was \"too much effort\" The thing is, card access is managed through the building automation system (which for Siebel is an Andover Continuum).  The reason for both of these was because the building automation system doesn't have a way to expire access automatically - for every person that was given access, it would have to be manually revoked.  It's partially bad design, partially because it just wasn't designed around the specific requirements of the department.  They didn't give access to CS undergrads for this reason, either.\n\nIn the somewhat recent past, a group of students developed a piece of software called STELA (System for Time-based E-lock Automation).  This is basically a piece of software that interfaces with the building automation system, and adds features to e-lock access (like LDAP sync, expiration, access groups, access requests, etc.).  Since they can easily give specific permissions to users and automatically expire them, they're able to be less restrictive about granting access.\n\ntl;dr new software mitigates the issues you listed it is really frustrating when some sort of software is used for school (and the school pays $$ for it), when CS students could easily do a much better job, for a fraction of the fraction of the price\n\nfor example: compass, moodle, or piazza. many CS students could make **significantly** better systems\n\nanyways, thanks for sharing, it's real cool those students did that Well, the thing is, the building automation system isn't just some arbitrary piece of software, it's literally what keeps the building running.  It controls HVAC, lighting, access control, occupancy, energy utilization, etc.  Access control is only a small fraction of what that system controls, and is one of the only parts the CS dep't actually controls (most is Facilities and Services).  Also, Andover Continuum is a campus standard (so A. Siebel isn't the only building that uses it and B. CS staff don't actually have any say in what gets used).  Changing this system would be a very lengthy endeavor since it involves so many different departments - and might not even be possible since some buildings that use it are LEED certified.  It'd be super costly and time consuming and just not worth it, even if there were a better alternative (there might be, I'm not familiar with very many BAS vendors).\n\nI agree with you to an extent, but I don't believe that the BAS could actually be replaced/written better in a practical sense.  Yeah, the front end could really be improved, but it's in an entirely different category than the softwares you listed.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you're wrong or that I disagree with you - I just wanted to clear up why the system sucks so much (and yeah, it kind of does).

What makes you think so? The casual use of idioms suggests someone who is either a native speaker or has resided in an English-speaking country for a number of years. There is a misspelling and it's hardly Shakespeare, but that's easily explained away by the fact that this is a logic-oriented person and wouldn't have extensive practice in composition. ESL and/or lack of fluency is obvious. The errors native speakers make are of the your/you're and there/their kind. They don't use double negatives incorrectly and convey the opposite meaning of what was intended.   Shutting down TOR stopped him?  Sounds to me like he's not nearly as good as he thinks he is.

The way TOR works makes it extremely difficult (but not completely impossible under special circumstances) to trace connections and find the attacker. \n\nAlso, in terms of computer security, attacking is almost always easier than defending. The defender needs to account for all possible security holes, but an attacker only needs to find one. Why is the ECE department or the university unable to catch the hacker?

It does look bad that a university with one of the top CS and ECE programs (I am assuming they are good at security research too?) is getting attacked by hackers. Petraus was not trying very hard.  He had a shared gmail account with his mistress, and they just wrote notes and saved them as drafts.  I assume they thought that was safer or something (it isn't, Gmail is a cloud service and all data is still online).  The FBI, who were most likely already monitoring him, just had to access his Gmail account.  They can do that fairly easily, as the Justice Department doesn't claim to need a warrant to read emails.\n\nThis \"ECE hacker\", on the other hand, is using a service called TOR (The Onion Router).  TOR was a government project that was developed to help people hide their actual location and identity by routing all internet traffic through a bunch of proxy servers around the world. while it can still be traced given enough time and resources, there is no way UIUC has that kind of power without LEO intervention.\n\nTL;DR Bigger fish, more technically challenging.

What do you mean? [The FBI found that the director of the CIA was having an affair from email evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraeus_scandal). That wasn't exactly like catching the ECE hacker, but I believe the expertise and skills required will be similar? This was front-page news for several days last month. Yeah, I heard about the scandal. I did not know the ECE dept was involved in it, though. ECE dept. wasn't involved of course. But I thought it was easy to catch hackers since others have done it, so why isn't ECE being able to do it? Is it very hard? There must be an FBI branch in Champaign too?\n\nEdit: I don't know a whole lot about these things, but is it so hard to find out who is doing this that someone would be brave enought to do this? They would surely be expelled if caught. here is a quick anecdote\n\ni heard about this guy working for cites or some computer branch on campus that eventually led to him altering gradebooks for his own personal gain.\n\nthe fbi, and kudeki got involved (i would me more afraid of kudeki) and the dude got expelled for 15 yrs. he ended up going to utoronto.

I guess your usage of \"they\" in the OC confused me.\n\nI'm not sure, I guess it depends on how much care this kid takes on covering his tracks. He hasn't done anything TERRIBLY bad, aside from the 329 thing, so I don't think the FBI would get involved in something like this. I think getting access to exams is pretty serious and is probably a crime, but probably not FBI-worthy.  If this email is real, this is the sort of thing that gives us engineering/science majors a bad rep. \n\nAnd is anyone even worried about this? I'm not a CS person, but I assume we don't have our top computer security experts working on \"defending the network\", meaning the \"worthy opponents\" he's battling against are just some tech guys who made the system a few years back The top CS security people don't look at the same stuff nor do the same stuff the top Network Admin security people do. They are not interchangeable. Much like a good Doctor is not really the same person as a good disease or drug researcher. Sure there will be overlap, but, there are differences. \n\nThe cites people are pretty good, but the thing in computer security is: there are always new/more bugs that are exploitable.  The top defenses are still not all that good at blocking *new* attacks. Further, the defenses themselves are just computer programs, and as such may be exploitable, and definitely have flaws.

When they got here, we had to find parking. I'm in the dorms so I don't have a spot. We drove around for about an hour looking for a place that wasn't a no-parking 2-6am. There are literally no spots like that anywhere on campus. Even in Greek-zone, up north, or out in Urbana, everything is no parking without permit or no 2-6am. And, they're all meters, which in itself is annoying if you want to spend the night and need to continually refill it.\n\nWe ended up having to park at a friends house off campus. I know they have temporary permits for sale but there are so many issues with that. First off, they only sell the permits from 8:30am-5pm, so if you show up after that you're shit out of luck. Also, even with these temporary permits, you can only park in E14 and F23. Fuck. That. \n\nThe worst part is that there are so many spots available but none of them can be used by the public. Why is there not a public lot anywhere? What are people supposed to do if they're just coming in for the night and don't happen to make it to the permit office or want to park in the shitty lots?\n\nAlso, is there anyway to complain to the school or county about this? We just had a new election. The school senate banned smoking. IMO, the parking situation is infinitely more important than outdoor smokers.\n\nSorry, end /rant. But seriously. Fuck you, U of I, and your shitty parking.\n\n\nEDIT: This thread has made me lose a lot of faith in you, r/UIUC. I understand I rambled in the OP, but I was nothing but respectful in the posts (originally) and yet I was getting downvoted and insulted. The tone of the majority of your posts is patronizing more than informative. I then lost it and just let all insults fly. I've noticed a lot that this community is very pretentiously based on elitism and very discouraging to text posts. I've seen many people been ridiculed for asking a question that has been brought up before. This is a small sub, but it's the biggest school one there is. That's why I'm surprised at how childish everyone around here acts. Have some maturity and act like decent Redditors, please.    The idea is to try and prevent all the students from bringing cars down and parking them all over the place. It's not going to change, so you've pretty much just got to get over it. Buy a temporary parking pass (if your friend isn't going to be there in time, go there yourself and have them pay you back), find some of the parking off campus, or just park on the street and pay the ticket if you get it (it'll be around $20-25 I believe). Also, check those meters. Most of them shouldn't be enforced all night long. \n\nBut in the end, this is a big campus with a lot of people and a lot of the employees will need to park somewhere. When you've got parking in high demand, this is what happens.  I understand that, but the fact that it is so large would make me think they should be able to open a public visators garage. Register and monitor the vehicles that park there to prevent students from parking there regularly and profit. \n\nTo be honest, taking the ticket is likely the best option. Is it really only $25? Is there any situation in which you would get towed or booted?\n\nAnd you're right, I think the meters stop charging after a certain time. But they still all say (or at least the many I checked), no parking 2-6am.  I've only been ticketed for overnight parking in Urbana, and that was $25 I believe. For a one time offense, you shouldn't get towed or booted. If you leave your car there for 3 days, then yeah you probably will.\n\nAnd they do have a place for visitors, it's E-14. It's not extremely close but it's the best option you'll get. You can't expect them to make it free, there is too high a demand for parking and it's a great source of money for the university.  I don't expect free. I would pay up to $20 if I could. That's my point, there's literally nothing you can do if you show up at 7pm on a Monday. I would totally pay however much to park on the streets or in a lot but you can't!  \n\nGod damn I really get more and more pissed about this the more I think about it.  This is only because you don't know what you're doing.\n\nhttp://ci.champaign.il.us/departments/public-works/parking-programs/visitor-parking/university-district-visitor-parking/\n\nThere's plenty of options. Lot J is probably your best bet, or you can stop being scared of leaving campus. Lots of busses will get you from downtown Champaign back to campus. Additionally you can just do street parking in Urbana and take the Green back to campus town. It's a completely straight shot and it's 72 hours of free parking. [deleted] You're bitching about needing to make it a block further than Hendrick House. That's about half a mile from the Union. You can't find decent parking near campus? Well, join the club. As an employee I'm expected to pay 8% of my salary for a parking spot, and getting anywhere near the campus core will require a multi-year wait list. If the university were to expand parking, the new spots would probably go to employees so that your janitor that has to spend all night cleaning puke wouldn't have to take a 20 minute bus-ride out to E-14. [deleted]  I didn't have a problem finding a spot when I brought my car here before thxgiving break. Just drive around a bit north of green and east of lincoln and you'll find a spot that you can park for 72 hours. That is so incredibly far though it's not even funny.  yeah it is, the only other reasonable alternative is buying a temp pass but that sucks. So yeah, I'd agree overall on campus parking isn't too great. That is so incredibly far though it's not even funny.

It might be somewhat of a time commitment though, and you will also need to either buy a tuxedo or rent one for each of the concerts.

They are all near useless and gave me tons of bad advice throughout my time here. I could've probably graduated another semester earlier if I was knowledgeable about scheduling back in the day. My career services was pretty unhelpful also (pretty much found a job on my own). I would rather donate money to a charity honestly.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your responses! It was interesting to read some of the insight by other members on this subreddit.   I will only donate money, assuming I am rich enough, on the condition that it only goes to improve the lives of students, and not just get caught up in the bureaucracy of a College's administration. So for example, no way in hell would I give money that might go to things like the faculty, advisors or career services like you said, but I would donate money to improve dorms, improve food, renovate buildings to include better workspaces for students, etc.  I agree with this wholeheartedly.

Perhaps their services would be better if there were more funds going into them. You think the reason some professors/staff are so shitty at U of I is because of lack of funding? The college of engineering is doing this I-STEM program where they are paying a bunch of people to improve freshman and sophomore level classes. Of the two courses I'm in that are participating I think they have actually made the class more aggravating compared to semesters past. Plus a bad professor that's been here for 45 years is getting paid buckets of money already, nothing will change his ways, including stupid ICES forms (off topic but as long as I'm ranting)\nMy point was money doesn't solve the problem of bad faculty or courses, but it can solve other problems that students will actually see benefits in day to day life   Already an alum of both the engineering and business schools. And no, so far I have no plans to donate. I'd give to the business school before the college of engineering. I always felt like unless you were incredibly gifted, the engineering school didn't give a shit about you. Business, on the other hand, seemed actively involved and interested in my future.\n\nI also don't like the idea of donating to a clearly (at this point) broken system. Out of control tuition, grade inflation, expanding bureaucracy, and diminishing worth of a degree. Once those things get under control maybe i'd think about it.  &gt; I really dislike my school's career services and department advisers.\n\nWhich school? :D Probably not in your department.

The reason is because the University has so many RSO's that it does not give a shit about. The university has enough to survive on its own i just want to make sure future students in my club can keep doing what we already do which is a major stress relief and honestly fun.  You're already donating to the school if you're paying taxes in this state      Actually, the school has a small team of employees whose jobs are to call Alumni and politely ask for donations. Someone I know has this job- it's amazing how many thousands she pulls in from calling these people. It's a weird set up, because the work she directly does brings in thousands, but she  herself is paid about minimum wage. I believe all colleges have something similar. I recall my brother receiving a call from the Alumni Association a few weeks after he had graduated asking for donations. He didn't even start work yet.     If I become filthy rich, I will donate enough so that the buildings where I got raped in my engineering classes would be named after me.  Then I would have a nice laugh.

No way we should be favored, Gonzaga has only lost 7 games in that arena the 8 years it has been open, I'm hoping for an illini victory but a close loss wouldn't be terrible. Who said anything about being favored?  They are at home and better ranked.  Of course they are going to be favored. &gt; but I like the matchup for us...\n\nTo me that sounds like you think we will be favored to win, and definately some people on loyalty are saying that we should win. I think that this will be a tough matchup for us and hard to win.     Be sure if you want to see the Western Carolina game tomorrow, you have to go; it won't be on TV.

If some creepy lady with a knife approached me, I'd probably run like fuck, not stick around long enough to give her my wallet and let her walk away. Knowing that I can outrun my friend while he races me on his bike, I believe I could probably outrun most people trying to chase me.  I would most definitely run as you said.  Some people aren't very fast when running, though, so that may have been a motivation to just hand over the wallet. HEY GUYS I\"M REALLY FAST! Why when I say things like this do people take it out of context?  I'm not bragging.  I'm simply saying that some people are fast and some people are slow.  Not everybody should run.

Pepper spray tends to blow backwards into your face so I wonder how effective it will be if used. If someone threatened me with a gun I think I would be very unlikely to aggravate them by using pepper spray; I would probably give them whatever they wanted. \n\nIf you lose your wallet you lose the cash (and maybe a good wallet); all the cards can be canceled (I would *really* miss all the loyalty cards from various cafes though).

I took mine at 100 Noyes.  It was a blazing inferno, as if they didn't think the exam alone was going to make us all sweat.  It wasn't that bad, just kidding I bs'ed a good 6 problems I lost a negative on the damn Stokes' problem ... also ... how do you have a minimum with a gradient =/= 0? I thought that was against the laws of math. it is?  Unless it's a function in x,y,z because if I remember correctly only fx and fy have to equal zero. I lost a negative on the damn Stokes' problem ... also ... how do you have a minimum with a gradient =/= 0? I thought that was against the laws of math.  HA! I was there for that. The alarm was going off for like a solid 4 minutes, and somehow through all of that the test was only delayed lby 5 minutes...\n\nAnd then you had that random person who finished in literally 48 minutes... Seriously though.\n\nI guess I would've gotten buttplowed by the exam if I had continued to stay with Boca and go to his lectures. Protip: Don't go to Boca unless you can learn by yourself. It was exactly 48 minutes too. That was freaky. I wonder when grades will go up.  Seriously though. I can't really complain, I left a little over 1:15 from the start of the test. Pretty sure I was one of the first 10-15 people done.   I was in the room at about 6:35.  Did the rest of you not use the north door?  Wasn't there, but I'm one of the leaders of a large RSO and we deal with CITES equipment all the time.\n\nThe University takes it seriously if you mess with the projectors and shit and you aren't supposed to have access. Authentication involves a keycode that you input, which unlocks the cabinet. The problem is that CITES equipment sucks ass and is unreliable, and will sometimes go off even when you're supposed to have access. (Also, keycodes can be up to 12 digits long and there's, of course, no room for error when you input them) This means that they can and will go off at random times, especially if the person operating them is inexperienced. Uh, I work at CITES and all of our equipment is locked with  4 digit codes. Also, we respond to problems very quickly, so I'm guessing you have us confused with another department... Very quickly? Just last week an alarm went off during a club meeting, and it took about 1.5 hours for somebody to show up; by that time, the alarm had stopped on its own. When was this club meeting?\n\nedit: never mind, did some creeping, and I can now make my argument.\n\nIf your meeting is on a Saturday: we don't have techs working then. There are people we can call to take care of it, but it's on their time off. Why it took 90 minutes is beyond me.\n\nIf something goes wrong: 9/10 times, it's the user's fault. I say that not because I'm being condescending, but because almost every time I've had to go out in the field to respond to \"something isn't working,\" it's because the user doesn't know how to properly operate our equipment. Either you're doing something wrong, or someone who used the class previously was messing with equipment they shouldn't have been messing with.\n\nIf you're inexperienced: we offer training. You can meet with someone to go over how to properly use the equipment. It takes a half hour, and you learn some basic troubleshooting. That being said...\n\nIf you're an undergrad (which you apparently are): **you don't have access to that equipment.** CITES equipment is for grad students &amp; faculty only. This is why there is an alarm panel or padlock; only they can request access to it. You shouldn't be able to access the equipment. You can hire an operator to come to meetings &amp; oversee that equipment is working properly, or you can have a grad/faculty member that's been trained be there with you.\n\nAlso, our access codes are only 4 digits long. I don't know where you're getting a 12 digit code from.  Haha, nice! \n\nJust got [OWNED!](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v672/jordanmacdonald07/Fatboy_reacts.gif) I didn't respond to him because most of what he said was based on inaccurate assumptions and I don't have the energy or willpower to have keyboard wars during finals week. Actually, your first post was full of inaccurate assumptions, starting with the assumption that the equipment you're using is supported by CITES.\n\n1. None of our equipment uses 12 digit codes.\n2. The equipment does have room for error when entering codes. If you enter it wrong, the alarm panel still displays a red light, indicating that it's still armed. It doesn't go off unless you open it while it is armed.\n3. Our alarms don't go off at random. They go off when a) someone opens the cabinet without disarming the system or b) when one of the sensors detects something is off (equipment stolen, cabinet door gets jostled, etc).\n\nWe both work at CITES so we know the equipment.  I suppose its easier to ignore the problems than to actually fix them. Very quickly? Just last week an alarm went off during a club meeting, and it took about 1.5 hours for somebody to show up; by that time, the alarm had stopped on its own. Yes, very quickly. When we're in our office (usually until 9PM), we'll get calls from our alarm company if an alarm goes off. As thencomesdudley also mentioned, if you're setting off the alarm that means you shouldn't be there. When we distribute codes they come with detailed instructions on how to use them. Why shouldn't we be there? We had the room reserved through FMS. We didn't have access to the CITES stuff for this particular event, but we didn't even touch it; it just went off by itself.

Good class overall but c'mon what's so hard about uploading some damn grades   I took CLCV 116 last semester with Solomon and all of our grades (homework, quizzes, papers, and both exams), were put into Compass. I'm not sure why things are different for this class. I'm curious as well. If he has the grades elsewhere it can't be too hard at all to upload them straight to compass from their spreadsheet. He's a great lecturer and I like his passion on the subject but he needs to work on his organization, I wouldn't be surprised if he lost some of the in class assignments and that's why he's not going to upload the grades (he'll probably give everyone a 100) That honestly might be it.

The Final exam grade isn't up and neither are 3-4 of the end of class assignment grades. \n\nI need to have him put those grades up because I've had problems with him already. The first in-class quiz he gave me a 0 even though I had turned it in. I understand it's a large class but losing my quiz and then giving me a zero isn't tolerable (wouldn't give me the points back, I still have a zero and it's been 2 months since my complaint. I emailed him twice). Hm, yeah, dunno, I only ever dealt with the TAs for grading, as he said they were responsible for all of it.  You would probably have had better luck if you went through them first. Some of my assignments had 0's that I turned in as well. I still had the files (some as far back as from the 2nd week of class) and just shot the TA an email with the file attached and the grade was updated. \n\nThe in-class quizzes are only worth 2 or 3 points as well but yeah sucks if your grade depends on those points.

There aren't any students at the law school, but most or all of the faculty are there. That means it's not a weekend, and it's not the middle of the summer, and it's not a time when classes are in session.

I'd be shocked if their delivery drivers are getting minimum while on runs. Yeah looks like from now on I'm going to be eating cereal for dinner on the days I would have ordered Jimmy John's. I didn't know the delivery drivers felt so strongly about $1 tips. If I am going to tip $3 I could as well order a $20 pizza or Thai food and pay the same tip, and make that food last for several meals - and that tastes much better than Jimmy John's, whose prime appeal is that their sandwiches are cheap. \n\nEDIT: I expected the downvotes but my point was that if people are expected to tip $3 for a $5 sandwich they will choose more economically viable options. They will place bigger orders and Jimmy John's might find itself getting only bulk/catering orders. Doesn't the sheer volume of orders make up for the low tips per order? Everyone I know orders from Jimmy John's, and with the pass-the-baton kind of system they have with an employee waiting outside with a sandwich to pass on to a driver, I would think a driver makes many deliveries per hour. Your logic is mind-blowing, \"Doesn't the sheer volume of orders make up for the low tips per order\" It takes just as long to deliver a sandwich as it does to deliver a pizza.... Obviously there are more sandwiches than pizzas delivered each night, but there's a shit ton more sandwich delivery drivers than pizza drivers. It doesn't matter what the total volume of sandwiches delivered is, it matters what the volume *per driver* is.... how the heck do you think jimmy johns always gets there so fast? they have lots of drivers.... \n\nAnd $5 + $3, is still a lot less money than $15 + $3.... if cash is so tight for you, I'm confused why you are ordering delivery - or eating out (as opposed to packing your own food) in the first place A $5 sandwich is one meal. A $15 pizza is several meals. If I pay the same tip, $3, for both orders and make 3 meals out of the pizza, then the tip per meal is $3 in the first case and $1 in the second.   Most of the time I pay cash and I usually tip two dollars. Sometimes I tell them \"Keep the change, ya filthy animal!\"  Most of my friends deliver for Jimmy Johns. Tipping is expected, usually $1-2 per sandwich.  Is $2 expected? It is almost 40% for their sandwiches.  people make this argument. then, when the same people order a $100 giant pizza order, they only tip $3, and say \"percentage doesnt matter, its the same effort for him as if he delivered a $15 pizza\"\n\nEDIT: typo The drivers actually quite often get orders in the order of hundreds of dollars. While a 20% tip is not expected, they do appreciate a sizable tip as it takes a long time to load/unload all of the sandwiches.  absolutely. im saying that the same people who will tip 20% on a 5$ order, all of a sudden tip a \"flat fee\" when the order is large\n\nEDIT: to clarify, people will always use the \"tipping rule\" that allows them to tip the smallest amount Is $2 expected? It is almost 40% for their sandwiches.  Is $2 expected? It is almost 40% for their sandwiches.   I usually tip $3 during normal hours but I've tipped upwards of $8 once at like 4am. good man       One of my roomies worked at JJ over the summer and he said that people who tip $1 should go to hell. One of my roomies worked at JJ over the summer and he said that people who tip $1 should go to hell. ill tip 20% for a delivery so a $5 sandwich gets a $1 tip. I dont see any problem with that.  Granted if I buy more I stay with my percentage and dont just tip a flat rate. The problem is that you are fucking over the driver, it is simple math. You can reason your way out of it to make yourself feel better, but you are being a dick and the only one who will suffer is the driver.\n\nEDIT: you are the kind of person, who if they had a coupon for a free sandwich, would order it for delivery, and tip the driver nothing, because hey 20% of 0 is 0. Whether you think that is fair or not, you are screwing the driver, and there is no way around that fact. I have to admit I looked over your comment history, and see many of your posts are to /r/trees. It is unrealistic of you to expect people to pay you 60% tips to finance your pot habit. I have nothing against marijuana but if it costs you money that you can't afford, it isn't fair to go ballistic on poor students who don't tip you unreasonable amounts. I was almost going to stop ordering from Jimmy John's because I won't pay $8 for a cold sandwich. I assumed your belligerence was representative of all Jimmy John's drivers, and was surprised that I didn't detect that much repressed anger in the many, many delivery drivers who have brought me my sandwich. They seemed happy enough with the $1 tip I gave them. Maybe not delirious with joy but certainly not as belligerent as you. a) if you felt so compelled to look at my comment history - you'd see I said I haven't delivered in years. \n\nb) my belligeryence is just 'internet belligerence' - to be taken with a grain of salt. it just blew my mind that so many people felt $1 was a fair tip. obviously, if you tip a driver a shitty tip, they will smile and accept it... having you calling their manager and getting fired certainly isn't worth letting a customer know you are displeased with their tip\n\nc) despite what you may think of me - i would challenge you to find a single jimmy johns delivery driver who is cool with $1 tips. they may not be \"belligerent\", but they are certainly pretty unhappy\n\nEDIT: \n\nd) i am done replying  to this read - i was just hoping my angered replies would convince some people to tip more fairly (although of course arguing over reddit can be entertaining as well). if you want to keep on tipping $1 go ahead - it  doesn't effect me and its obviously not going to kill the driver Well you have done the opposite as now after reading your replies I now think of all delivery drives as entitled pricks and will never tip them more than 20%.  judging all delivery drivers based on one person who claims to be a delivery driver on reddit, love it Do you love it as much as I love the look in that sad pathetic driver trying to fund his pot habit as I leave him a dollar as a tip? ahhh, a bud hater, my favorite kind of person. if i had posted /r/beer not /r/trees i doubt you'd criticize me for drinking beer. people who think smoking pot is awful but drinking is legit.... i just... don't have the words\n\ni haven't delivered for years. i've been working remotely as a webdev for over a year, which provides ample cash for entertainment. \n\nEDIT: I made the assumption that you are okay with alcohol consumption judged on your \"Is It Unofficial Yet\" tag.     The more important question is how much do you tip when there is a delivery fee? A lot of restaurants I order from off of eatcu, like papa johns, have a $1.95 delivery charge. Does that just go straight to the driver? If it does then they are already getting $2 per delivery on top of any additional tip left for them. Drivers NEVER get any portion of the delivery fee. Businesses charge a delivery fee to cover the insurance needed to cover their drivers.  Businesses rarely actually buy insurance for their drivers. It's a clusterfuck when you get an accident because the driver's insurance will disclaim liability, as will the victim's, as will the business's.

I believe this classic scene is necessary. \n\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-qV9wVGb38    I delivered at jimmy johns for a year, and to the people that tip one dollar, you suck. Gas and car repairs aren't cheap, nor do I think that any of you guys would like a dollar tip either. 3 dollars is solid  You expect a $3 tip on a $5 sandwich? If someone were to spend $8 why would they order Jimmy John's in the first place? Jimmy John's is popular because it is cheap and fast and doesn't have exorbitant delivery charges.\n\nYou should be paid more but your employer should pay you more, not customers.

Get your lazy ass off your couch and drive to Jimmy John's. \n\nThe amount of money he pays in gas, insurance, and car maintenance does not change whether you order a $4.75 sandwich or a whole load for an entire party. \n\nIt was true in pizza delivery, and I bet it's true in sandwiches too:\n\n- $0 makes the driver pretend he hasn't seen your order, and you wait until a manager forces them to take it to you.\n- $1 is a shitty tip.\n- $2 is a mediocre tip.\n- $3 is a good tip.\n- $4+ makes you a friend, and drivers will fight to take your order as fast as possible. You'll get extra toppings and if something gets screwed up, you'll get it remade so that it's the best possible quality.   guys.... you should be tipping atleast $2. i've delivered pizza, sandwiches, and chinese food... and its pretty insulting when the shmuck who answers the door has enough money to eat a fucking 6 dollar sandwich but wont tip you more than a dollar.....\n\nthe worst is delivering to a group of kids studying... they're all sitting their with their MacBook Pros.... they can afford a 1.5K laptop, but can't afford a $2 tip... you people like that, go fuck yourselves They paid you $1 out of kindness to do your job, and you say they can go fuck themselves.

Almost every delivery place will round up the drivers tips when they cash out so anything over about 75 cents will most likely end up being a dollar in the drivers pocket. Most drivers only get around $6 an hour on their check though so making $1 tips all night is barely enough to cover gas and bring you up to minimum wage not to mention the wear and tear on your car. That's not at all how it works. 75 cent tips aren't rounded up to a dollar. All the tips are added up, so for example if you got three 60 cent tips, 60+60+60 = 1.80, that total (the 1.80) is rounded up to $2. It's not 60 cents rounded to a dollar, plus 60 cents rounded to a dollar, plus 60 cents rounded to a dollar. I said 75 cents bud... How many 75 cent tips do you get a night? It's really not that many and it \"will most likely end up being a dollar\" provided you get a few. If your getting that many 75 cent tips to where it doesn't perhaps there's a reason people aren't tipping you well. Right, if you get 1 or 2 75 cent tips they will each essentially round to a dollar, but I think the point is you shouldn't be tipping a dollar in the first place  As much as i hate to see someone tip me less than a dollar you don't have to feel too bad.

I have literally never heard of that policy of rounding up. When I delivered on a cash system, I got a \"bank\" ($50) at the start of my shift and had to buy every order when it came time for delivery. At the end of the night, I had to return my bank. When I delivered on an electronic system, I got a bank ($20) at the start of my shift and had to log every delivery I took, then pay for them at the end of the night. That's still how it works. At the end of the night whatever you owe the store (cash - card - card tips) is rounded up or down accordingly. I've delivered at 3 or 4 different places in my life, and none of them rounded.  So you had to pay the store in exact change? That sucks...

I can tell you that I would support a restriction on drops of required courses in my major.

The only people really showing up are new Spring transfer students and people who have drastically misunderstood the way the world works (\"I'd like to drop a class\" or \"I'd like to add a class, I've done all the work for it\"). The questions about finals are mostly by email so pretty unstressful. Are you serious? I'd like to add a class is hilarious.  As someone with a 102 degree fever on the night before 2 final exams, this is pretty relevant. Although, both professors are letting me take the conflict exam if I provide a doctor's note, which I will be getting tomorrow.  I'm hoping your still answering questions on here because I have an issue. I have the stomach flu and cannot really move without getting sick. I've been getting better though, and was wondering what happens if I say I'm too ill to take my tests, but by the time I get a doc appointment tomorrow I'm no longer vomiting. I'm just worried that by the time my final rolls around I might actually be able to move, but I've lost all my studying time.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14t7ky/fyi_if_you_miss_your_final_exam_due_to_illness_a/", "id": 678, "title": "FYI: If you miss your final exam due to illness, a doctor's note is not the only thing you need."}, {"snippet": "    Good.

Showing off his technical/hacking knowledge and skills seemed to be a prime source of self-esteem/self-worth for him.\n\nSo my amateur assessment of his psychological profile (I am not a psychologist or psych major):\n\nECEHacker being an only child and being homeschooled had no close relationships except with his mother, and must have been devastated when she died. If she was sick for some time he must have been experiencing chronic, high-level stress for some period of time. Being socially awkward he didn't make friends here and probably didn't have skills to deal with grief/loss. If he was egotistical he probably didn't want to seek counseling and believed he could handle it by himself. Running seems to have been an outlet but he probably needed more stuff to regain the attention that he missed now that his mother wasn't there to give him that anymore. He seemed to have posted the first post about the hacking himself, as /u/ECEStudent2012, to draw attention to himself. Not sure if he is evil (probably not) or just a confused, disoriented guy with poor life skills and in difficult circumstances crying out for attention.\n Most of what you said sounds accurate, but he probably had at least a few friends despite his social awkwardness. One of my friends in ECE has a favorable opinion of him and said that he was friends with ECEHacker.\n Yeah now that I think of it grief about the loss of his mother might be an oversimplification and might not be the *only* reason for his attention-seeking behavior. We don't know much of his history, like why was he homeschooled? Did he get into trouble at school and was expelled (like he has been from college)? Or was he bullied? Or could he not adjust socially, or did he have learning disabilities? (I am not knowledgeable about why children are homeschooled or how they get admitted into college without high school grades).  I have no idea about ECEHacker's situation, but keep in mind that being homeschooled does not mean you keep no records. (It also doesn't mean you're socially inept. Hooray for stereotypes.) I received grades for every class I took in high school, many of which were taken outside the home anyway.  I just wasn't enrolled in a public or private school.  I had no problem getting into accredited postsecondary institutions, and now I'm a grad student here.  \n\nMany colleges accept self-made high school transcripts signed by parents, perhaps with documentation from the local school board certifying that the student has been enrolled in a home education program.  For me, it wasn't much of an issue because I was (1) dual-enrolled in a commmunity college part-time for 10th-12th grades and (2) scored highly on the SAT.  If I had scored badly on the SAT/ACT, no doubt my high grades on my transcript would have been called into question.   I really don't know anything about homeschooling, so sorry I made assumptions. I assumed that since conventional schooling is the norm, there must be a really good reason for someone to be homeschooled. I only know what I read on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling):\n\n&gt; The three reasons that are selected by the majority of homeschooling parents in the United States are concern about the school environment, to provide religious or moral instruction, and dissatisfaction with academic instruction at public and private schools.\n \nYou say:\n\n&gt; Many colleges accept self-made high school transcripts signed by parents\n\nCan't parents inflate grades then? \n\nIf you don't mind sharing, why were you homeschooled? Were you homeschooled all through kindergarten to high school or just a few years? How did you make friends your own age?

I'd wager that it's based on your visibility within the company, though...If you stay off the radar and Stephen never notices you, you might be fine...As long as you can handle the low pay.\n\nThey tried to make it somewhat \"fun\" and \"relaxed.\" Free soda and other beverages, a foosball table, etc...But the pay sucked, working anywhere near Stephen or anyone else in his family was a total drag and telling people \"no\"---even if you were completely justified---would get you in real trouble.\n\nI could go on...But I'm out of time for now. I'd avoid Wolfram at all costs. Work somewhere---anywhere---else, and you'll be doing yourself a favor. &gt; I started off as Help Desk and when I left my title was still Help Desk\n\nSo you were an application support specialist?\n\nI am also curious why they call themselves \"Wolfram Research\"? What research do they do? MATLAB developers call themselves only \"The Mathworks\".\n\nStephen Wolfram did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/) a while back and there was a lot of angst against him in the comments. He says he lives in Boston, so isn't the Champaign branch free from (what seems like) his tantrums? They still seem to have a fair number of employees and seem to be one of the major employers in town after the university and the hospitals.\n\nThanks for your reply! Internal Help Desk, part of the IT group. I left Wolfram in 2005 so department and position names may have changed. The external support groups at Wolfram are Tech Support and Customer Service. You call Customer Service when Mathematica chokes on your license key and you call Tech Support when you can't figure out how to get something to work right in Mathematica.\n\nApparently you'd call Help Desk if you were an employee and you needed an Office upgrade...You'd tell us you'll be leaving your computer at your desk while you're at a meeting...But you take your laptop and leave the external monitor. I have *lots* of stories like this...\n\nNo idea about why they're called Wolfram Research, Inc.\n\nWhen I worked there, Stephen was still in the process of moving to Boston from Chicago. Most of SW's time was spent in Chicago, but he would come down regularly---at least for every company meeting and usually more often---to wreak havoc, fire entire departments, call us all blithering idiots, etc. Good times.\n\nWhen SW lived in Chicago and his home network stopped working, guess who he called? Us. In Champaign. So some poor sysadmin---I was never \"lucky\" enough to get this task---would drive up and work on his stuff, usually literally being screamed at by SW the entire time. SW got one sysadmin so worked up he ended up puking from the stress while he was there. Not cool.\n\nI was the technical lead for a project, the goal being migrating our 3,500 mailing lists---note, at the time we only had 300 employees, so let that sink in for a minute---and all their archives from Majordomo/MHonArc to Mailman. The project was a slam dunk for me...Pretty straightforward. Of course, SW's brother Conrad was overall \"in charge\" of the project. I banged heads all the time with Conrad about his decisions that weakened the project from a technical or support point of view...He hated the way the Mailman footers looked in messages, so he wanted them turned off. I lobbied long and hard for why that footer should remain on---it gives you easy access to your settings for the list, easy access to the archives and a few other reasons---but was finally told by my IT supervisor to \"just turn the thing off.\" So I did. Then forwarded all support calls for people asking how to get to the Mailman archives or list settings to Conrad's phone.\n\nThe footer got turned back on. :) \"I never realized there would be *that* *many* support questions.\" That's just it...They make decisions about stuff like that there without listening to the tech geeks' opinions.\n\nThis project got \"taken away\" from me a week or so later, cause I wasn't cooperative enough. That was literally the reason the project got taken away. \"Conrad feels you are not agreeing with him often enough.\" I said, \"great! Someone else can deal with Conrad.\"\n\nThe gave me that project back a month later, mostly cause Conrad hated the other guy even more...I may have been opinionated, but at least I made sense.\n\nThat's how it goes there. It's an unholy combination up top of academic refugees and corporate micro-management.\n\nI've always heard it said that \"Wolfram is a great place to have worked,\" and that's absolutely true. It *does* look good on a resume, has a pretty low bar for entry in most cases---will work for peanuts seems to be about all that's required---and can expose you to a pretty large group of people in various fields, all of which are looking to get out as fast as they can. :)\n\nThe only real bright spot at that place is the people. I've met some of the most talented, most interesting people I've ever encountered at Wolfram, a lot of whom are still friends of mine since I---and a good number of them---left the company. Some of us still socialize and a lot of us work to hire people from Wolfram after we're gone. It's a great source of talent. Excellent post. Why do you think Wolfram turns out to be a great source of talent? I'm not involved, but I'm going to guess it's because it's in the University's backyard with a low cost of entry (You can walk to the interview from from the senior laden Champaign housing and the requirements are not too stringent) &gt; low cost of entry\n\nWhat do you mean by that? Can you elaborate further? Excellent post. Why do you think Wolfram turns out to be a great source of talent? Koch Media GmbH is *not* the same as the Koch Brothers things, right? I am glad that Volition is staying in town since it's probably the second coolest place in CU (Wolfram is number one, obvi.) GmbH means it was incorporated in Germany. It's not the same.

I started Parkland in the fall, with plans to transfer to U of I for it's Computer Science program after two years.\n\nI joined the military when I was 20.  I regret the two years I wasted inbetween high school and the military FAR, FAR more than my time in service.  The benefits are numerous and awesome.\n\nBeing older has only been a blessing.  During group projects, younger members often look up to me to set the pace for the work. Being older and serving years under strict authority (Well, Air Force. . . so kind of strict) means I interact very well with my teachers, who see me as professional, motivated, and capable.\n\nI'm not saying young people cannot have those qualities, but you can bet your study habits and work ethics will be in place if you've served before.\n\nI was very nervous at first attending school again. I graduated high school in 2006 as a smart but lazy student and was never a fan of math.  The faculty at Parkland have been nothing short of AMAZING in helping me adjust and I finished my first semester with a 4.0. Maybe after a deployment to Afghanistan Algebra doesn't seem that tough.  Who knows?\n\nAnd the G.I. bill is everything you'd imagine.  It pays full tuition, $1000 a year for books/fees, and I get about $1200 a month tax free to just pay bills on.  It's too good in my opinion.  On top of that you can collect the full Pell grant.  I'm able to list being a student as my full time job, and still make more money than my employed girlfriend.  It's really let me enjoy my time in school.\n\nIf you want to know anything else just ask.  Are you in the position of deciding whether you want to join college or the military?  You should really check out somewhere like /r/veterans or even /r/military to get some more opinions. This basically echoes my feelings and situation too, except I really didn't enjoy the Army as an organization. I did love the people I worked with though. They were absolutely fantastic.\n\nSheep, did you sign up with the old GI Bill and convert to the new one, or did you just get the new one right off the bat? I think I might be one of the few (read: the lucky) because I signed up and kept the old GI Bill, AND I had the Army College Fund on top of that. In short, I get like ~$2600/month (tax free) and the IL Veterans Grant pays for all my tuition and fees. It's pretty hard to complain with that arrangement. I came in under the Montgomery, and chose to give it up in order to take the GI Bill.  I could have used the Montgomery for 4 years then the GI Bill for 1, but the loss of 3 years of BAH (The $1200 every month is only for the GI Bill) was a no brainer to me. Interesting. So can I assume you weren't an IL resident when you joined? Otherwise it would have been more profitable to keep the old GI Bill because it's paying ~$1600 per month right now, and the tuition would have been covered by IVG. Regardless, it would appear you're doing fine so keep up the good work! :) Hi there.\n\nI served 4 years in the Air Force, separating last spring.

Can someone link to this reddit post they speak of? the supposed ECE Hacker did an AMA here on /r/uiuc a while back. It was deleted because he basically just ended up asking himself questions and then answering them. Can someone link to this reddit post they speak of?  Why would we suspect the keyloggers and the \"tampering with locks\" to be the same person? &gt; After the first incident, where one lock was damaged, an e-mail was sent out from a professor's account with information about the vandalism, but the professor hadn't authored the email, Geis said.\n\nSounds like his M.O, at least. I guess \"makes the lock inoperable\" to me sounds like random mischief. Maybe it was supposed to imply that he used this method to break into a locked building?   I wonder how the roommates feel?  Also why would he would not be attending UIUC yet live on campus?    Again remember the importance of innocent until proven guilty. So there are connections that do not fully prove he was responsible(Doesn't mean the cops don't have anything). We got some websites he visited and a supposed confession which may or may not have that much weight.  Yeah. I'm not seeing much to link him to the lock tampering and fraudulent email - at least not from the article. There's a post linking an alias of his with the hacking of TA accounts, but it's all kind of inconclusive without directly linking one of his machines to the post. The packaging sounds like it could be damning, but we don't really know enough yet to tell.\n\nHe definitely sounds like a douche from what others here have said, but I'd hesitate to rush to judgement. This could be an unfortunate collision of CITES finding evidence of something similar (the TA hacking), some attention seeking bragging, and the police saying \"Wait, I remember this guy. He was weird...\".   Why?

Any suggestions will be considered and are greatly appreciated. Thank you guys so much. Let's make campus a safer place!  I think bike lanes need be more thoughtfully laid out in some areas so they don't abruptly end or begin. For example, when bike riders (like myself) are heading east on Armory, when they get to 4th, there is no easy way to get onto the bike path that runs by the sidewalk adjacent to the Armory. I've seen a lot of people have to continue in the street and it really makes drivers nervous to have them riding alongside them, especially if they stay off the bike path all the way to the light at 6th and Armory. Basic things like that. I think bike lanes need be more thoughtfully laid out in some areas so they don't abruptly end or begin.

Basic things like that.   Suggestions:\n\n* Make security whistles and pepper sprays widely available (kind of like the cold packs and contraceptives at McKinley). Right now only those people who take the initiative to buy them possess them.\n* Make SafeRides more responsive. Don't turn down requests for rides and ask the caller to take the bus because the bus stop is only 2 blocks away. A lot can happen in 2 blocks in a dark, scarcely populated neighborhood at 2 AM, or even at 9 PM. Yes, a few people will take advantage of this and end up using SafeRides as a free taxi service, but I think that is a reasonable cost to bear if more people can be safe. I feel like the saferides issue is my biggest concern. I have never been able to get saferides to cooperate with me once to take me home despite being really close to campus, so by the time I'm even on campus i just resort to a bus.  The purpose of 335 SafeRides, which is agreed upon by the University of Illinois and Illinois Student Senate, is to \"provide safe transportation to individuals who are generally traveling alone when **no other means of safe transportation are available** within the designated boundaries.\" The [boundaries](http://www.cumtd.com/maps-and-schedules/route/335-saferides/weekday/night/map) reach just beyond the UI campus. As you can see on this map, there are five MTD routes that offer late-night fixed-route service (after midnight): 50 Green, 100 Yellow, 120 Teal, 130 Silver, and 220 Illini. These routes cover a tremendous amount of ground and operate with 10 and 20 minute frequency.\n\nThere are rules to riding SafeRides. When someone calls, they will be asked questions their origin and destination as well as how many people they are with. \"There is a maximum limit of three persons per pick-up location, except at the Illini Union, ISR, and the Main Library at Armory &amp; Wright. 335 SafeRides **does not duplicate fixed-route service already provided by MTD.** 335 SafeRides does not provide emergency transportation service to medical facilities. **335 SafeRides does not provide service to and from the bars.**\"\n\nTo read between the lines, if there are groups greater than three people travelling together there is a fair assumption that there is safety in numbers. For students who are on campus and travelling to a densely populated area like a residence hall, the Illini Union, or a library, fixed-route service is perfectly suited and much more available. But for students who are starting and/or ending at destinations that are remote such as off-campus apartments, campus buildings or labs located in corridors not served by fixed-routes - SafeRides is a valid option.\n\nAs CJS7070 mentioned, wait times would be increased if students within a reasonable walking distance were all granted a SafeRide. Students make requests for SafeRides even when both their origin and destination are on fixed route service. Students will move themselves further from fixed-route service and call MTD again in hopes of reversing a denied SafeRide. This is unfortunate, but a regular challenge of providing the service.\n\nIn answer to simplyxsilly and AlmostGrad100, there are two SafeRides vans in operation Sunday through Wednesday and three SafeRides vans Thursday through Saturday during the UI Fall and Spring Semesters. CJS7070 was correct that MTD added to SafeRides service in the recent transportation contract renegotiation for 2012-2015. The additions included the extra van Thursday through Saturday as well as adding SafeRides service serving during the Fall, Winter, and Spring Breaks.\n\nMTD and the University of Illinois want students to use SafeRides and fixed-route services when travelling at night. Campus crime is an unfortunate battle that MTD is helping combat. MTD launched an awareness campaign, [Bee Scene](http://www.cumtd.com/the-inside-lane/2013/01/14/bee-scene/), this Spring 2013 semester to increase awareness of safe behaviors which include night-time safety.

Safewalks. That should definitely be a thing more people remember. Is there anyway for, say, MTD to coordinate with SafeWalks so that people who call in a ride, but are, say, 2 blocks from a stop, can get safewalks called for them?  Safewalks. That should definitely be a thing more people remember. Is there anyway for, say, MTD to coordinate with SafeWalks so that people who call in a ride, but are, say, 2 blocks from a stop, can get safewalks called for them?  Even a student-based organization for safewalks would be a good idea. I transferred from a school with a paid student security team, and one of their big responsibilities was walking with people at night if they felt unsafe. Most of the time this was as simple as walking them across campus to their car. It was utilized by students and staff. I feel like the saferides issue is my biggest concern. I have never been able to get saferides to cooperate with me once to take me home despite being really close to campus, so by the time I'm even on campus i just resort to a bus.  I think that's the point - if you're within a certain distance of a bus that will get you to your destination, you need to use that service instead. \n\nPeople say SafeRides service is slow now; imagine if it also picked up everyone who requested a pickup despite their proximity to a fixed service location.

I don't think many people are so lazy that they would wait half an hour to avoid a one-block walk, and then possibly be driven all over Urbana and Champaign for half an hour more before they get home. Suggestions:\n\n* Make security whistles and pepper sprays widely available (kind of like the cold packs and contraceptives at McKinley).

I was given a whistle as a freshman, do they not do that any more?  I believe the overwhelming consensus is they don't work. When I took the rape class thing as a freshman, what they said was, \"You blow your whistle, then anyone around you blows theirs, then anyone around them blows theirs, and in a couple minutes the police know someone is being raped somewhere in the Champaign-Urbana area.\"  I believe the overwhelming consensus is they don't work.

Sounds good except for the pepper spray part.  It's not an effective tool for stopping an attacker.  Speaking from experience. Really, were you attacked and did the pepper spray further aggravate the attacker? I have wondered about this, whether pepper spray does disorient the attacker or does it aggravate them. I am sorry that you had an experience like that. Relax it was part of a non-lethal course when I was active duty.  \nIf you can hit someone in their open eye with your pepper spray it should (but not guaranteed) stun them for a few seconds.  But can you draw it, and spray accurately, and make sure their eye is open faster than they can grab you? If you can then do it and run like hell because after that initial shock (if you nailed an open eyeball) you can still see.  And yeah, it's aggravating, so much so that I don't care who or what you are, if I get sprayed ever again I will latch on to that person and keep hitting until they stop moving.  If someone wants to hurt you I promise pepper spray will make them want to hurt you more. It was never meant to be a tool for self defense.\n\nThe fact that you recommend it without ever having tried it on yourself is very irresponsible, feel free to try it.  Have a friend spray you, but it's painful and it lasts for hours. Sounds good except for the pepper spray part.  It's not an effective tool for stopping an attacker.  Speaking from experience. Do you have any recommendations given your experience? Suggestions:\n\n* Make security whistles and pepper sprays widely available (kind of like the cold packs and contraceptives at McKinley).

Is it only one now? It has been quite a while since I used a SafeRide, but a driver once told me that they have 10 vans (if I remember correctly) operating at peak hours (maybe 10 PM - 4 AM). Even that is a pretty low number in my opinion. I found [this article](http://www.cumtd.com/the-inside-lane/2012/02/27/uiuc-transportation-fee/) which says that an increase in the number of SafeRides was one of the primary requests that the Illinois Student Senate made last year to MTD. \n\nI also think they shouldn't deny requests which sound like taxi service requests, like people wanting rides to/from parties or bars or restaurants or grocery stores. They shouldn't treat requests for rides from libraries/departments to dorms/apartments as the only legitimate requests. Denying SafeRides isn't going to stop people from going to parties or bars, and if they don't want to spend $15 on a cab they will end up having drunk people walking back who will be less alert and more vulnerable to crime.

To be quite honest, I'd like to get into another discussion: How safe is the U of I to the rest of Champaign/Urbana and other college campuses? The amount of crime alerts that we get and how it fluctuates sorta skews perceptions (mine, at least) of how many crimes there actually are.\n\nTo me, it seems that a lot of the crime alerts that we are emailed are the same type of crime - someone walking out alone at night that just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. On a campus this size, where many people are out during the middle of the night for various reasons and have various levels of awareness, odds are eventually someone will be unfortunately robbed. I'm not saying that nothing can be dome about the crime here - I hope there are some real improvements and that you can make some big changes - but to what extent can the university enforce safety policy in campustown, which would only be the Uni Police (please correct me if I'm wrong)? The data is out of date, but the site is still useful. Check http://campuscrime.net, which was made by a journalism class here. It explores some of the issues you brought up.  From [http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf](http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/CurrentASR.pdf) for 2011,\n\nArrests for rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft:  93  \n\nArrests for liquor and \"Drug abuse\" (because anyone who uses drugs is an abuser, right?  Nevermind, I don't need you to read from the student handbook):  464\n\nJudicial referrals for liquor and \"drug abuse\":  1028\n\nInstead of undercover cops at bars; why not local gangs?  Instead of finding intoxicated minors;  finding burglars?  Instead of looking for people carrying open liquor;  carrying weapons?\n\nAnyway, I feel safe on campus.  At least, I feel as safe as I do anywhere else.\n\nEdit:  Slight change for clarity Those are some nice stats you have there, but you have to take into account the sheer number of \"rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft\" that happen are ten folds smaller than the number of underage drinkers/ drug abusers. \n\nAlso  cops don't give a shit if you're drunk. It's when you are drunk and doing really stupid shit, that's when you get a ticket.  &gt;Those are some nice stats you have there, but you have to take into account the sheer number of \"rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and auto theft\" that happen are ten folds smaller than the number of underage drinkers/ drug abusers. \n\nAnd the number of arrests that occur for the amount of crimes committed are vastly smaller as well.  You do know that the majority of rapes go unreported, right?  Or look at the other person who responded to my post.  Most people who are mugged/robbed don't even file a police report, because the police don't care/can't do anything about it.\n\nRegardless, that's sort of beside my point, and was only suppposed to be used as an illustrative tool.  What's more important to the people who are paying to go to school here?  Or the kids' parents who sent them here?  That the kids don't drink or that they don't get mugged?  That their child isn't raped or that they don't smoke pot?  \n\nI don't know what the statistics are, but I'd like to see a survey of the campus police departments or the people who are in the administration of the school.  How many of them drank underage or did illegal drugs?  Considering that teen drinking rates have dropped since the 1960s, and that we still have 80% of people under 21 having drank, I'd think it's a very safe assumption that the majority committed the same illegal acts.  IT SURE RUINED THEIR LIVES, RIGHT?  THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SAFER IF WE GAVE THEM A TICKET.\n\n&gt;Also cops don't give a shit if you're drunk. It's when you are drunk and doing really stupid shit, that's when you get a ticket. \n\nNot really, just being in the wrong place at the wrong time is enough.

Something else to keep in mind is that the University doesn't report all the crime going on in the campus area. A couple years ago I was assaulted on Green St in front of Za's around 2 in the morning (many people were still out and about), and when I went to the campus safety building to report it, the cop basically told me that the University police wouldn't even report it since there was basically nothing they could do about it.  People not understanding the difference between sidewalks and bike paths. Also bikers not understanding the difference between bike paths and sidewalks. Lets all ride our bikes down the quad when it's ridiculously busy! Seems like a fantastic idea Also bikers not understanding the difference between bike paths and sidewalks.  I always ride my bike. It wasn't for a safety reason, but thinking about it now, I think it's a safer way to travel.  I may be alone in this, but I have always found the lighting on campus (esp. the main quad) to be way too dim, more like mood lighting than anything else. I'd like big bright lights around campus. \n\nI'd also like to see the \"safety tips\" in the crime alerts to go away or be revised severely. The tone of them is very victim-blaming to me. People have the right to safe travel on campus at night, and shouldn't be made to feel guilty if they can't round up a posse for safety every time they go out. \n\nEDIT: As the comments have descended into a debate on victim blaming, here's something I'd like to see in the safety tips: What the fuck do I do if I am getting mugged? Do I do what the guy says? Do I curl up in a ball to protect my voonerables or do I fight back? Should I carry a decoy wallet like the Europeans do in mugging areas?

Telling a person to take measures to protect them self from harm is not \"victim blaming\" \n\nBut no, instead, let's tell criminals not to do bad things.  They always listen right? You can only control your own actions, your safety is up to you. Most rapes are by acquaintances. Usually they tend to rationalize things and not see themselves as criminals. The \"common sense\" tips they tend to dispense, like not walking alone in the dark doesn't help in these circumstances.

It's almost all student housing between University and Kirby and Neil and Lincoln (or Race?). I'd like to know when there is an uptick in criminal activity on my street or block, which is where I'll be walking to in the late night and early hours, rather than just what is happening around the quads and dorms. Well, that pretty much encompasses the entire campus.... keep in mind, the crime alerts are mainly for the university, not for CU as a whole.     Enforcement of bicycling laws - I was hit (not hard) on Green Street underneath one of many signs that say \"No bikes\" that are posted every 50 feet or so on Green Street yet are universally ignored and not enforced. I also dodge cyclists almost daily riding west on East John that blow the red light in front of Swanlund to cross Sixth and proceed the wrong way on East John (which turns into a one-way at this point headed east) while barely missing pedestrians crossing East John in the marked crossing with the walk signal on.  Concealed Carry. Concealed Carry. IIRC, carrying on campus is an expulsion worthy offense under the student code. Concealed Carry. **Pros:** Would, for the most part, deter attacks that we associate with crime alters.\n\n**Cons:** In college, many people consume lots of alcohol. Guns would not be a good addition to that.\n\nIn principle, the idea makes sense - no one is going to fuck with people if there is a possibility anyone is carrying. At the same time, all the drunkness in college, and other issues like stolen guns and people who use bad judgement while the carry could make even worse problems than robbery. I understand your point well, but the difference between concealed carry and not **to me** is this - when there's no concealed carry, I have to watch out for that one person that's hiding from me at night; when there is concealed carry, I have to watch out for any bad situation or altercation or people that seem unstable any time, day or night.  That's a perfectly reasonable concern, fortunately most carry laws prohibit you from carrying while intoxicated and/or in a bar.  That doesn't mean that people won't break the law, but if people aren't carrying now because it's against the law it stands to reason that they won't carry when it's still against the law. Oh yeah, I'm sure there won't be guns allowed in bars, but you never know what will happen during those many pregames. *Anyone* carrying a gun would scare me. Mental fitness varies with time, and even the possibility that someone might be lax about their weapon would scare me.  A person who was mentally fit at the time they bought the gun might get depressed, stressed, intoxicated, drunk, high, addicted, fail out of school, have a break-up, lose a loved one, and that might affect their mental health - no one can accurately predict a person's future mental health, and unless the government keeps track of every gun owner's mental health on a daily/weekly basis, I would feel very afraid if I knew everyone was carrying guns, and walk on eggshells trying very hard not to upset anyone because who knows when they might snap.   I think people are less fragile than you give them credit for.\n\nI suppose I could make all the standard arguments against what you're saying (but I would feel like an ass), so I'm mostly curious why you think this way. I think I just explained why I felt that way. Only one person needs to snap to kill 20 people. In a university with 40,000 students, even if the probability of that happening is 1/40,000 that would be too great a risk. A mass shooting making front-page news every month or so does nothing to dispel my fears. \n\nAlso, it's not so much a question of fragility as emotional stability *in the moment*. A drunk person might be normally stable when not drunk, but might have poor judgment and poor impulse control while drunk. And universities have young people with less maturity and less impulse control and more testosterone and adrenaline than the general population, and they are also under stress (academic, moving away from home, etc.). I really don't think you would want to add guns to this mix. Granted, not everyone snaps, in fact the vast majority doesn't, but even if the probability is 10^-4 , it's 4 people and that's 4 people too many. I think 1 in 40000 is way over estimating. Using your example of a mass-shooting making the news every month (and assuming all of those happen in this country) that is only 12/300,000,000 (approximately 4X10^-8 percent of the population (if we use 40000 as the campus population that makes 0.0016 people violent psychopaths)).\n\nThat's not to say I think everyone should be able to carry a concealed firearm (I'm in favor of background checks and mandatory training), but I hope that gives a bit of perspective. Rough calculation: [Illinois has ~1.2 million gun owners](http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/illinois/number-of-illinois-gun-owners-jumped-in/article_bcd7271d-28d1-54bb-b67d-87e498864b82.html), and the [intentional homicide rate is ~6 per 100,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#United_States). The [population of Illinois is 12 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), so that is a rate of 6x10^-5 when 1/10 th of the population owns guns. If everyone owned a gun, the rate would be 6x10^-4 , 24 times higher than 1 in 40,000 (= 2.5x10^-5 ). *Anyone* carrying a gun would scare me. Mental fitness varies with time, and even the possibility that someone might be lax about their weapon would scare me.  A person who was mentally fit at the time they bought the gun might get depressed, stressed, intoxicated, drunk, high, addicted, fail out of school, have a break-up, lose a loved one, and that might affect their mental health - no one can accurately predict a person's future mental health, and unless the government keeps track of every gun owner's mental health on a daily/weekly basis, I would feel very afraid if I knew everyone was carrying guns, and walk on eggshells trying very hard not to upset anyone because who knows when they might snap.   I have to agree to a large extent - I know people that use guns for sport and protection in their home, and that doesn't bother me at all. Also, our attitude toward guns is dependent on culture and environment - many western states have very lax gun laws and concealed carry is common. If we lived in one of those states and were exposed to those behaviors, maybe our feelings would be less apprehensive. \n\nWith that being said, the amount of trust that I would have to have from everyone around me if guns were concealed carry would be about the same as the amount of trust I wold have walking home in the middle of the night by myself, and that is not much. In short, I wouldn't feel safer in a situation where I or someone else has to actually use the gun; there are many more variables to consider when you can't be sure who does and who does not have a weapon. Of course, I would almost always be safe in a concealed carry environment, but the times that I'm not would outweigh the benefits in my situation.\n\n**EDIT:** Grammar &gt; Of course, I would almost always be safe in a concealed carry environment\n\nHow? In a hypothetical situation where everyone carries guns, how would you protect yourself if someone shoots you from behind? Or like the Aurora theater case, would you immediately be able to get your gun out in a dark theater and protect yourself? I think many people would be uncomfortable carrying a weapon at all times and would not do it even if it were legal. If we need to carry lethal weapons at *all* times to protect ourselves, then it means we trust our fellow men too less to be considered a civilized society. And sometimes weapons bought to protect yourself can be used against you, like the Newtown guy who used his mother's weapons against her. I don't think people can be trusted to be that meticulous and careful about their weapons, someone who lives in the same house is eventually going to figure out how to use them if they are determined to do so. My use of the phrase 'almost always be safe' was a reference to time, as in most of the time, we can trust people to not use their weapons in some sort of altercation, or worse, unprovoked. This is how I think about it - lets say there is a hypothetical situation where there is an altercation within a group of people and everyone has a concealed weapon. Most likely, no one would brandish their weapon because they would know that if they did, some one would retaliate and everyone in the room is in grave danger. Common sense would (hopefully) prevail.\n\nThe almost comes in due to cases that you just described - a situation like Aurora or Sandy Hook, which in a sense of any one person's probability of being in an incident of that nature is extremely low, but the consequences of that actually happening is so devastating that it wouldn't be reasonable to have concealed carry.\n\nI do agree with your opinion that most people would not carry weapons if there were lax gun laws because they aren't needed. With the law enforcement that we have today, its rarely necessary or even beneficial in a densely or even moderately populated area. The hypothetical situation you describe is actually what scares me most about concealed carry laws: groups of strangers \"self-defensing\" each other to death.\n\nAnd I say this having lived in Tennessee, where gun restrictions are absurdly loose.

Concealed Carry. Haha, good luck trying to get that to happen in this state.   [The SCOTUS ruled that Illinois laws banning concealed carry are unconstitional.](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-11/news/chi-us-appeals-court-strikes-down-states-concealedcarry-ban-20121211_1_court-strikes-appeals-court-david-sigale)\n\nI don't really know how it's going to work out, though.  Chances are good that it will just be near impossible to get a license for it. It was only a federal court, it won't likely go to the supreme court for strategic reasons. \n\nAs for the provisions themselves, they're likely going to be a middle ground. The courts gave Illinois a 180 day hiatus before all bans on conceal and carry are struck down. The republicans can block literally all progress and still essentially win. However, even the republicans don't want to see the laws just disappear as that would be chaotic and look bad for them. This means that the pro-gun side is going to have push beyond what their numbers may suggest. Also, the NRA is dedicating a lot of money to this so any for-sale politician will be in the pocket of the NRA by voting time. \n\nPersonally I'm hoping it ends up being a shall-issue system with mandatory training. May-issue systems end up being won't-issue for anyone but the rich and powerful. I've always wondered this since the decision came out, but if Illinois doesn't write a law that has a provision for concealed carry in the time frame, what happens?

I used to work for the University of Illinois Foundation (UIF) http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/, as a student caller who phoned alumni to receive donations for our university. The donations that UIF collects from Alumni is very essentially to funding all three U of I campuses, individual colleges, academics units, libraries, scholarships etc. UIF uses a standard computer phone banking software that dials an Alumnus, shows the student caller the Alum\u2019s current job, address, graduation year and major, previous donations, etc. and then prompts a script for the student caller to say to the Alum. If an alum does not answer or if an alum does not want to donate the student caller has to code the call and a reason for why a donation was not given to U of I.\n\nThis is the point in which Campus Spirit Revival becomes relevant. One of the most common responses, to not giving donations to the University was because of the loss of the Chief. The response is so common that it is the first reason coded in the program when a caller codes why an alumni did not donate. UIF trains all of the student callers multiples times with mock calls as to how to deal with Alumni who are upset with the loss of the Chief and has pre-scripted responses as to try to alleviate the situation, and possibly still get the Alumnus to donate.\n\nThe number of calls in which Alumni told me that U of I lost them when they lost the Chief was discouraging. Granted a good number of Alumni calls were never answered, the ones that did answer either laughed, or regrettable told me \u201cno\u201d because of the Chief being gone and how the University does not care about the opinion of its Alumni. If an Alumnus was ever very upset about the Chief there was even a special comment coding that would go straight to the Chancellor\u2019s Office for them to assess input from the Alumni. All student workers at UIF know this is an issue, as otherwise we would not be trained so heavily on it. While some veteran student callers may disagree slightly it is only because they are set in their ways and with their seniority only have to call Alumni who are yearly renewal, frequent donors. \n\nThe data of how many donations are lost to U of I due to the loss of the Chief and their relationship with Alumni in theory should be quantifiable by the UIF coding system, but a dollar amount cannot be expressed as UIF managers claim \u201cwe cannot put a value on the loss of each donation from an Alumnus not donating because of the loss of the Chief \u2013 because there is no donation\u201d.\n\nAfter working evening after evening calling Alumni and hearing them upset with the loss of Chief and how the University does not care of their input as an Alum, but only desiring their money, I eventually became sickened with my pre-scripted responses for the Alumni. Talking with the Alumni, brought light to how out of touch our University Administration was with Alumni, and I began to become sickened that I had become a part of that system. I decided I could no longer do the job UIF required of me. I no longer believed in the bullshit they told us to tell Alumni, the scripts of why to still donate with the Chief gone, if an Alum was upset with U of I, etc, so I quit my job at UIF.\n\nI bring all of this up now, because the reality is, that every year this university loses a larger amount of donations from Alumni not only because of the loss of the Chief, but because Alumni feel disillusioned by how little the University cares about their opinion on matters, such as the Chief. The review of comments on the Campus Spirit Revival Facebook page is flooded with negative remarks from Alumni and terrible rebuttals from the admins of the Campus Spirit Revival page. If the University follows through with the input from Campus Spirit Revival - this poor representation, unworthy to be associated with U of I - will be a large insult to Alumni and will be viewed as U of I once again turning its back on Alumni opinion. I have recently been told that Chancellor Wise has appointed a Dean to oversee the outcome of Campus Spirit Revival and use their input. If this input is reviewed in the similar fashion of the smoking referendum results, then Campus Spirit Revival\u2019s chosen mascot could be viewed by Chancellor Wise as input enough to put a motion forward. Should Campus Spirit Revival be backed by U of I or their results taken seriously by University Administration, I feel this could turn Alumni away from U of I on the same magnitude as if they removed the Chief a second time.\n\nPlease consider our U of I Alumni and how their donations fund this great university when making an opinion on Campus Spirit Revival. \nSupport Stop Campus Spirit Revival http://www.facebook.com/StopCampusSpiritRevival?fref=ts\n\nAnd when voting in Campus Spirit Revival\u2019s farce of a contest, vote \u201cNo New Symbol\u201d, as Good Alumni Relations and campus funding may just hang in the balance.\n  That's really sad to hear that this leaves such a wound with all the alums. I don't have strong feelings about the issue either way, but this really saddens me - not just because of the deterioration between a university and its current *and* former students, but mostly because of what I interpret this to imply: that the Chief, our mascot, is not only vital to the function and the image of our university, but it is the MOST IMPORTANT thing about this university. The responses seem to imply that this university is not worth the time or the energy if the Chief is no longer our mascot. They imply that the university should suffer because the Chief is no longer our mascot. It really saddening to hear that, even though this university does some corrupt things, that this is a great school that does some remarkable things, and all that seems to be for naught. I understand that the heart of the issue, the underlying issue is the arrogance of the administration to disenfranchise its own alumni, but I never thought that our mascot - our Chief - would be where everyone drew the line.\n\nSo I ask one question to you OP (and to anyone else who has some experience talking to alumni and talking about this issue) - does the anger stem from the loss of the Chief, or the betrayal of the administration to remove it? **tl'dr:**Essentially a long winded version is the arrogance of the administration as you pointed out. I don't think its the Chief in particular that draws the line though, I think its everything he represented and the way the administration went about getting rid of it. \n\nI think you kind of missed the point or at least what I believe the point of many of these Alumni would be.\n\nI think their disinterest is probably due to their perception that the University administration doesn't honor or respect the traditions of the University. I think tradition and legacy are naturally the things that keeps Alumni interested and obviously the University administration doesn't hold those concepts in the same regard as the Alumni do.\n\nObviously this isn't related to the Universities mission to educate at all, at which it does a great job. However I imagine a lot of the Alumni feel like this is no longer the institution they knew (my family had the record for the most students from one family here at one point, so there are a lot of Illini Alum in my family and I'd say thats a sentiment they would mostly agree with). I think that's the aspect of it that would make them reluctant to support the University.\n Traditions and values represented by the chief passed along from generation to generation - makes sense. I'll admit its hard for me to see things from that perspective; my second cousins and myself are the 1st generation to go to the U of I (most of my family went to Eastern). \n\nI'm sure there's some documentary or book or articles online, so I'll look for it later. But, if anyone would like to give their opinion, how has the chief come over the years to embody our collective values?  I think a lot of it had to do with his tenure as the mascot (Since 1926). Not only was the Chief or Mascot but he was also the logo of the University, I think he was the most visible symbol of our University.\n\nI think (though obviously many would certainly disagree) that he was dignified in a way that not many mascots are. He would only come out to dance at major events, and wasn't cheering along the sidelines or anything, he was something of serious business.\n\nI suspect the people wanting to remove the Chief and the controversy surrounding him had a lot to do with it. I think it is seen by many as an attack on our institutions traditions orchestrated by elements from outside the University. I suspect that aspect of it has a lot to do with the negative feelings over his departure.  And perhaps that what I was missing in all this. I see your point - the Chief isn't like most mascots where its some guy in a cartoonish animal suit, or even \"human\" mascots like the Fighting Irish mascot - the weird ass spastic leperchaun, or in light of recent events, Manti Te'o. There's a bit of reverence to it. \n\nI think what makes this such a divisive topic is that this is not just an issue of choice, it is an issue of what people identify with - an extension of the ego. This issue is a battle of pride and dignity; the adversaries are the competing perceptions of dignity between those who identify as pro-Chief, who view the Chief as an uniting embodiment of their pride and dignity as an insittution, and those who identify as anti-Chief, who view the Chief as an embodiment of the humiliation and stereotyping of native Americans. Either way will cause a loss of dignity and subsequent anger. The univeristy may have not had much of a choice about the Chief, but I wish that the aftermath was different. I hope that they try to empathize and relate to their students and alumni as much as possible, because it seems we need a way to display our pride and honor, and that there are a lot of bridges to rebuild. Indeed. It'll be interesting to see what happens with this movement for a new mascot.\n\nI imagine for a lot of Alumni (and me personally as a recent Alumnus) I'd rather have no mascot than a new one. Even if hes not allowed to dance anymore I think the Chief is still alive and well in the hearts of many members of the University of Illinois family. \n\nI think in another few decades though we'll see people being more open to changes in the mascot, when most Alumni don't remember the Chief and some of the intensity and anger of the debate has been reduced.

I would say that all universities have difficulty managing the expectations of their alumni, but ours fell extremely short when dealing with the issue of the Chief and thus left Alumni disillusioned with the University of Illinois they thought they knew. I think that by not taking into large consideration of what Alumni preferred, and what Alumni valued to be a part of ILLINOIS tradition, the administration created a group of ILLINI Alumni that were bonded much stronger than before as the group now had a large sense of connection of being for the past traditions of Illinois - what they felt made Illinois great - and against what the University administration now determines what is ILLINI tradition. The loss of the Chief was a catalyst that not only created disunity between the University and Alumni but created large unity between Alumni and the current students that do not get to experience the Chief and the values and traditions of U of I. The loss of the Chief was not a mascot to these Alumni but a symbol and logo that represented the values and traditions of what makes the University of Illinois great. Moreover, the Chief as a symbol collectively tied together the generations, that came through the university and was passed down through the students that fueled and made U of I a better place for all. When the decision came to remove the Chief, as an Alum you would expect the first person to back your tradition would be your University, but they pressured by the NCAA. This is where I feel the resentment towards U of I began, and from that point on the University should have dealt better with Alumni relations - and maybe they did - but it was not enough. Perhaps the administration underestimated the negative aftermath that could be created by Alumni relations or took Alumni for granted, but in the end not only donations, but also sporting events ticket sales have suffered largely. \n\nAt this point, I feel that the appointment or the process of finding a new symbol or mascot will only create more division between the Alumni and the University. We hold one of the largest living Alumni bases in the country, and while there will always be those who will support U of I no matter what, there is still a huge group that could be supporting us to the extend of the loyalty and donations of Notre Dame's Alumni. There is no reason to further aggravate or possibly insult our Alumni by using the results of Campus Spirit Revival (which Chancellor Wise at present, may very well do). Campus Spirit Revival has been a trivial search process (with the probable intention of a resume addition) that is poorly managed, and inconsiderate of Alumni and their dissenting opinion, that I can only foresee this birthing a negative outcome and ripple effect among Alumni and current students alike.  I feel like this Campus Spirit Revival is just some attempt to wipe everything under the rug and pretend that the last 80 years never happened. I understand that the university has to comply to the NCAA because forfeiting playoff games would essentially destroy the sports program, but the university doesn't seem to want to have any discussion about how to proceed. After all, mascots are for fans. In the end, we either have a mascot or we don't, but the administration could acknowledge that feelings have been hurt and try to find a better solution, if there is one, to this.  We never had to forfeit games. We were told we could not host and the chief could not dance at playoff games. The first clause is the one that the university was concerned with, since the NCAA playoff games bring money in for the host University. We never had to forfeit games. We were told we could not host and the chief could not dance at playoff games. The first clause is the one that the university was concerned with, since the NCAA playoff games bring money in for the host University.

Any thoughts?  Thanks    I had a lease with them a few years back when the husband was still around. They're not bad, but we weren't the type of tenants who ever really asked for anything. The apartments are kind of lower-end, we couldn't run the microwave at the same time as the A/C or the breaker would flip. We also had a problem with running through light-bulbs very quickly --just a terrible electrical system. We got most of our security deposit back (they made us pay for cleaning the oven, which is understandable). I wouldn't be worried that the woman's running the business by herself now, the husband rarely did anything in the first place. Just out of curiosity, which building were you in?     Currently with her now. A semester into my lease and so far I have nothing to really complain about. If anything, we regret getting an apartment with a tv included in it. At this point, you can get a better tv for the same cost and it will be yours after the lease is up. The locations she offers are pretty hard to beat for the price. \n\nAs for the comment about the bike sticker thing, I haven't needed one at all. \n\nEdit:\n\nWas reading comments below, she is quite strict with no candles and no space heaters. So far, I haven't had any huge issues with the electrical system at all (The only thing being that the bathroom fan takes a few seconds to turn on sometimes.) Found it a little that she wanted the first month's rent a month after signing, then waited a few months to cash it, but if that's my biggest complaint... not bad at all. She charged you extra for the TV? For us, it was \"the rent is the same regardless, if there's a TV in the unit, then you get a TV.\"  Ended up with a unit with both a TV and ceiling fans.  No, she's not good. She takes forever to get anything done whether it be cashing in your rent checks, sending back your deposit, giving you a bike sticker to park your bike in the bike stands, fixing heat. My friend lived with her last year and went without heat for the whole winter and had exposed wires from his heater the whole time too. \nAvoid Shlens like the plague &gt; My friend lived with her last year and went without heat for the whole winter\n\nYeah, I'm calling bullshit.

That was pretty scary to see since it was the first time I saw someone get taken out of a bar. \n\nOverall, your best bet is to keep your eyes moving and stay away from entrances. Kams has a big red light they turn on when the cops come in. Brothers has nothing and it is harder to tell since there is a wider age range. I've seen a few cops upstairs just sipping a beer and observing the crowd. Stay towards the dance floor, dining room, picnic tables and you should be good at Joes. Cops know that the upstairs usually has underage kids often. Stay away from that. For Cly's, stay as high as you can. Just follow that logic everywhere. Raids are just a few guys walking around. Stay near windows and look for the paddy-wagon if you want to be alerted the quickest way.  A cop came in and put someone in a chokehold without saying anything at all?  Really?    Murphys - first week of school. Should've known to wait a bit longer, bar was practically empty  [deleted] [deleted]    rock paper scissors?  Even though I'm interested in the homecoming incident.  No need for an AMA really. Not a lot goes on. The cops come in, the staff are all alerted quickly and secretively. They begin taking drinks from those who look underage (or in the case of Kam's, slapping them out of their hands). When the cops see people who look underage, they ask them for their IDs. If they're under 21, they'll pull them outside and write them a ticket, sometimes on the sidewalk, other times you get to sit in the paddy wagon. This might be a dumb question, but how does the staff know when the cops come in (since they are undercover and are in plain clothes)?  No need for an AMA really. Not a lot goes on.

If they're under 21, they'll pull them outside and write them a ticket, sometimes on the sidewalk, other times you get to sit in the paddy wagon. I heard about the wagon.  Apparently it was used at White Horse this semester.   The paddy wagon goes everywhere. I live right next to Red Lion and its usually in the alley behind the bar on nights that their raiding (Around 10-10:30). Again, common sense and dont go out to the bars on nights they traditionally raid (first couple weeks of school and moms/dads day). They walk in announced and quietly. If you dont see the paddy wagon chances are your SOL unless someone alerts you.  Don't forget right before finals, Halloween, and Unofficial.  Basically any major weekend if you're under 21 don't have a drink in your hand there.  Honestly, as someone under 21 I never try to drink at a bar unless I have a friend 21+ willing to buy me a drink, and usually I stay clear of the entrance.   Just rip cups of shots if you know people that work at the bar. They're quick and you can take them every few minutes while looking out for cops and still getting intoxicated.\n\nYou can do this if you don't know someone there, but it's going to cost you more money to the point its not worth it. This too. Either way I try to avoid walking around a bar holding drinks as much as possible.   Can anyone explain the arms length rule. Also if you're in a bar and look intoxicated but are not near alcohol can you still get in trouble? I don't know what it is *exactly*, but the gist of it is that any unclaimed drink within an arm's length can be considered to be in your possession    Can anyone find me the law (if it exists) that says you must show an ID to a cop when asked in a bar?\n\nOtherwise I would assume you do not have to show it due to 4th Ammendment, as it falls under 'papers'.  When they ask for IDs -- \n\nDo they scan the ids or do they just look at them?   When they ask for IDs -- \n\nDo they scan the ids or do they just look at them?   Im pretty sure they just look at them but youd be in a hell of a lot more trouble if you give them a fake and they call your bluff. The bar gets in a shit ton of trouble though if you're 18.

In other words, 1) it's repetitive! 2) it's easy! That sounds like it should be automated, right? So I did that! I've made a program that will do it for me, and hopefully for you too.    \n    \nSpecifically, it's a program that checks the information for a specified course and section, available at courses.illinois.edu; if the section is marked as Open, then the program will email you the happy news!

This is also not a browser refresher or anything; every time it checks, it starts from scratch. Furthermore, I recommend you use it *no more than 4 times per day*. Even that might be a bit excessive by UIUC standards. No registration is done by the program, only availability checking.\n\nYou *do* need credentials to have it email you, however this does not have to be an Illinois address and can be any other email service (such as Gmail). (I set up it to use the Illinois address by default, since everyone has one.) Setting up other emails should be essentially the same as setting up Thunderbird or Outlook Express for that address; Google is your friend in this case.

My room looked out over Green Street and the ISR parking lot.  It was the middle of winter and there was a ton of snow on the ground (it snowed a LOT that winter, one of the snowiest winters in my memory).  Anyways, it was decently late at night, and around the end of Finals week so the ISR parking lot was mostly empty as most people had already finished their finals and gone home.  I glanced out my window and saw some people in the ISR parking lot driving a pickup truck, towing a dude on an inner tube around behind them as they drove around in circles and shit.  Now, anyone who has walked by the ISR parking lot a bunch knows that there's almost always an ambulance sitting in it with a couple paramedics standing by.  The ambulance started up and suddenly started driving over towards the guys dicking around in the pickup truck.  I thought for sure they were going to get a safety lecture, and it seemed like they thought so too because they stopped and sat still as soon as they noticed.  The ambulance continued approaching them until suddenly, out of nowhere, they flipped its emergency lights on (no siren though), gunned the engine, and started doing motherfucking donuts in the snow.  Continued for a good solid 15-20 seconds spinning around in circles before coming to a complete stop, turning off its lights, and returning to its previous position as if nothing had happened.  The inner tubers didn't seem to know how to react, they just sort of hung out there for a few minutes, presumably laughing about the whole thing, and then got in their car and left.

I'm looking for more current info on tunnels around campus. I've explored the noyes/chem annex/adams tunnel but I'd like to discover some new ones before break is over. Let me know what info you guys have/what you've found! Thx  This probably isn't the best subject to post about in a public place.  I would highly suggest not going into the steam tunnels until summertime when they are inactive. You could die, jus' sayin'. I've never been, but I'm pretty sure they're \"active\" year-round.  They're doing the same with cooling/chilled water - so both steam and chilled water are available on a campus-wide basis all year.  It's more efficient that way than doing it on a per-building level.  There is a pedestrian tunnel complex that starts at Bevier that connects through as far south as the greenhouses on the south side of Turner Hall. **CAUTION:** They are heavily trafficked by building occupants and F&amp;S personnel; they may also require a registered I-Card and/or keys to access.  People are actually allowed to go there, as far as I know.  I used to work for IT Services on campus, and my boss frequently told us to use them when we were carrying large computers, printers, etc and didn't want to be awkward on streets. Something on campus that makes sense? Wow! Maybe the coded IDs and keys were for after hours access?    What, exactly do you want to know? I doubt anybody has maps to post. I left the area quite time time ago but could, most likely, reconstruct much of the steam tunnel network given a current UIUC map. When you see those large concrete \"benches\" with the grates on the sides; those are steam tunnel entrance/exits [they only open from the inside, normally]. Knowing where those are you can make some pretty good guesses about where the tunnels underneath go. The Quad is circled on the inside [of the buildings] on the East side and they run between the street and the buildings on the West side. That is the 'primary' steam tunnel ring and is fed directly from the power plant (a *long* walk from the Quad ring). You can get about anywhere South of Green Street from there. To get North of Green you have to pass through 'Hell' [It's marked]. If you are at all claustrophobic: DO NOT GO THROUGH. The 'Hell' tunnel is filled with pipes and has very little clearance to crawl. Also the North tunnels are much newer and less interesting than the South tunnel complex. If you have more specific queries: please feel free to ask. [Note: All information will be maybe 10 years out of date].

As a Uni High Alum, I can tell you that no students with just a normal Campus Rec Membership, beyond those involved with the gymnastics teams and the handful of clubs that also use the gymnastics practice facility (which is inside Kenney Gym), can use Kenney Gym. A while back, it was open to the public, but now it is only open for a couple of hours midday and requires an additional fee as it is not connected with Campus Rec memberships, I'm not sure of the details of this club, but it may be limited to faculty and staff. The weight room is nothing special, and I highly suggest staying away from that track as someone who, now two years later, is still feeling the effects of running 4-6 miles a week up there for all of eighth grade and High School. WHY THE FUCK IS 15 LAPS A MILE?! HOW DOES 15 LAPS EVER MAKE SENSE AS A FUCKING MILE?! GAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 15 laps to a mile is what we were told to adhere to in class (workouts were still given in laps, not miles, so it didn't matter).

No, no, see, I'm saying that I hate that that is the way that it is, because I have to deal with it. Like, now. Because I go to Uni. (On a side note, did you know the track is supposed to be green? They just cleaned it recently and it was sticky. As in, your shoes would actually stick to the track. And not come off very easily. It took less effort to just run the long way on the wood. God, I hate that track.) All five years that I was there my shoes stuck to that track. I was at Uni when we had the MRSA case in the locker room from one of the people who used the track at lunch time (non-Uni student). Never gone barefoot in that locker room since. Then there was the day when the urinal failed and the whole building smelled like stale urine. Oh the stories I have of that place. Oh the marks the class of 2011 (my class) left on that place. As an '09er, christ I'm old. ...'05. Guess that means I've got one foot in the grave then.\n\nDo they still make you wear those heart rate monitor straps?   Let me know if you try and are able to, I live across the street and would totally be more motivated to work out if I didn't have to go to CRCE or the ARC.  I'd suggest e-mailing them but i think it's open to students. You hear about professors going there all the time. It's managed by the university as well. I think it may be the home for the gymnastics portion of DIA.  It's used by Uni High for PE and basketball so the open hours are going to be pretty limited compared to CRCE and ARC but they do exist (or at least they use to). There's is a gymnastics floor but I think the gymnastics team may have relocated to another facility in recent years.\n\nThe track is a pretty short one (something 15-16 laps to a mile) but the weight room is fairly complete. Hi Yang. Go back to your Seattle subreddit or whatever.  The gym is mostly used by club gymnastics teams, and related things like tricking and parkour. I can't say anything for their basketball court or weight room (I'm not even sure they have a weight room), but I do use the gymnastics gym there pretty frequently. There's a small track, some weights, a few excercise bikes, and tons of gymnastics equipment. \n\nThe gymnastics gym has open gyms from 6:30-9:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm pretty sure they do on Mondays and Wednesdays, but I've never been on those days. It costs 5 dollars each time you go and the first time you go you have to sign a waiver. They lock the doors shortly after 6:30. If you arrive after the door is locked, you have to pound on the door until someone sees/hears you and lets you in.

They do all the in initial and followup visits in town, but the actual surgery is done in Bloomington. \n\nI initially had my eyes done 6 months ago and they were VERY bad (approx -9.0). I could see great the next day. My right eye was perfect but they slightly overshot my left eye so it was slightly farsighted, I recently went back for a 'correction' on the left eye and it seems pretty good so far. Everything is included in one price including any followups like I had. \n\nI'm glad I did it. It's a bit painful for the first few hrs after surgery but otherwise it's a really quick procedure and recovery is easy... just lots of drops. Its amazing being able to see without glasses. Thanks for your story!  What was it like getting approved for it?  Did you have to have X amount of eye exams from the past year saying you were unchanged, or anything like that?\n\nI'm 25 and havn't had one in a couple years, so I'm thinking they'd make me get some before I had it done correct? I don't really know. I got referred from my eye doctor that I'd been seeing annually for years. I don't think there was any formal reporting of being unchanged or anything. I believe they just asked me. They do a free test/consultation to check to see if you're a candidate. If you decide to do it then there's a few exams over a period of a month or so before surgery.

Treating a stroke is all about restoring bloodflow to the affected area of the brain as rapidly as possible - even ten minutes can make a difference, so having it go unnoticed for an entire class could be deadly.\n\n* Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg - especially on one side of the body.\n\n* Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination. \n\n* Sudden severe headache with no known cause.\n\n* Aaphasia: sudden and extreme language impairment. Often (but not always) involves a mixing-up of words: a person trying to say, \"I feel weird\" might speak the words \"Red lick spaceship.\" It works the other way, too - they might speak clearly but suddenly lose their ability to understand speech.\n\n* Sudden slurring of speech\n\n* Sudden and severe nausea\n\n* Sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes\n\nIf someone around you starts exhibiting any of these symptoms, **CALL 911,** clear a path to the door for the EMTs, ~~and if possible, give the victim aspirin and get them to chew it.

I thought it usually happens to older people (50+).    What causes a stroke and how can you avoid getting one?  I wouldn't have the victim take aspirin.  I'm an EMT and that isn't in our protocols for a stroke, there are other, better drugs that Paramedics and the docs in the ER can give.  But if they've taken aspirin then they might not be able to get those meds due to certain contraindications or adverse reactions.  Also, those symptoms could be indicating a LOT of different things, including bleeding in the brain.  If you give someone with those symptoms aspirin and they have a brain bleed and not a stroke, you just killed them.  Just call 911 and get the person to the ER ASAP.  Even if you aren't sure, go to the ER immediately. Dad had a previous major stroke so I knew what to look for. Saw his face drooping and asked him to smile. He said he felt weird but kept trying to convince me to not take him to the hospital. Ended up making him go and I was (unfortunately) right that it was happening again.

Also, at various points during the exam, people were pulled out for a speaking test. It only lasted a couple minutes, and was fairly basic.

I'm a girl and I can really drag out the stereotype of a posh English accent if the need arrises. I think I'm going to like America.\n\nHa! It's great to get such specific advice - I'll remember that name. Apparently I'll have less choice of courses than the average student though so I bet I'll end up stuck with the guy. I'm actually not sure on my thesis yet, I'll be taking History 498 this coming semester and the topic is Wealth and Poverty in the History of Christianity...so something on that topic! I'd prefer to write on the American Colonies and the 16th-18th century but there isn't a thesis class offered on that subject. \n\nI'm so sorry if you get stuck with that professor. Also, try not to take more than three history classes a semester, I took four once and the reading was around 250 pages a night, just got way too overwhelming to keep up.\n\nMorrassy and Koslofsky are really good professors, really enjoyed their classes. (Names might be spelled wrong)\n\nOh! Many have \"Participation\" grades (Which I hate). The best way to guarantee the full percent to that is just to go to their office hours a few times and theyll remember you. I never participate, aside from showing up (most days) and always get that credit.  Ah, it works a bit differently in the UK I think - you can do whatever the hell you want really. That topic sounds great though.\n\nThats good advice. It will be pretty good if I can mention specific professors and suggest an interest in their work - I'll do some more research.\n\nI'm that asshole who asks loads of stupid questions and argues about anything. Doesn't necessarily make you super popular but I just got some performance reviews back and the professors loooooooove it. You can also do that in the History department at UIUC, but it's a two year process so unfortunately it wouldn't be open to you as a one semester exchange student.\n\nIf you get into the program I highly recommend taking any courses offered by either Mark Micale or Bruce Levine. Kristin Hoganson's course on the history of American foreign policy is also excellent and would probably be of interest to you as a Brit. \n\n Hey! \n\nI'm a history major, will graduate this summer.

As an engineer, I can't answer 1 or 2, but I can try for 3.\n\nTo me, UIUC is a cool place because of the size and diversity that we have here. You have probably seen that we are quite a large school - about 32,000, and that's undergrads alone - and a lot of us are from different walks of life. Because I'm a student at this school, I've met with many people from other countries - we have one of the most, if not the most international students at this school - and I became friends with them. Being from the US midwest isn't the most diverse experience that a child can have, but working and hanging out with people from other cultures is just expands the paradigms about people and how we relate. I'm sure that's why you're coming here, and I commend you for that. You'll get to meet Americans and non-Americans alike, so I guess its a bit of a bonus.\n\nWe have more fraternities and sororities than any other school (this is a different discussion all its own because I'm sure you don't know much about those) and you'll interact with many people in these organizations too because of the sheer amount of people that are in them. I am not a part of a fraternity, but my experience here really made me lose the stereotypes of frat people partying and drinking all the time. Don't get me wrong, that happens - a lot - but some of the most intelligent people that I've been in school with were in fraternities.\n\nI would say that you could learn about US sports such as American football, but were not the best in that. By any means. However, if you enjoy basketball, you'll get a glimpse into big time college sports culture (which is unique to the US), and its a discussion all its own too.\n\nNow is this place the only place in the world where you can find this stuff? No its not. You can find professors that are the cutting edge of their field in many schools. You can find those special students that do things that just don't seem possible to an average college student, those people that are in commercials for what they achieved - they may be rare, but you can find them almost anywhere. But what you can find here, and I can almost guarantee this, is a place that is your own. That's why people love college so much - with the amount of people and diversity of cultures and interests, you'll find people that you like, people that make your experience special. And I'm sure that you'll do the same for them. Oh, and by the way, we have some pretty good academics too. But Im sure you saw that on the university website. \n\n*We work hard, and we play hard.* Hopefully you get to be a part of it for 16 weeks.\n\nGood luck getting in here. I hope this helps. Wow! Thanks so much for such a detailed reply - I really appreciate it.\n\nMy University is great but pretty small for Universities in the UK and certainly not as diverse as UIUC seems to be. The website is very keen on reminding you that the student population is pretty international but to hear about it from a student and in the context of how it really does enhance your educational experience is very helpful. I think I'll be focussing on this idea if I get an interview.\n\nFrats and the like are a complete enigma to me and I think most people outside of the US. I think it shows just how different the university experience is and I hope that\u2019s an idea I can weave into my application. The same with college sports - not that they're not a big deal in the UK but it just seems to be on a whole different level.\n\nThe idea that UIUC is a very good school but, in a lot of ways, not much different to plenty of other schools in terms of student experience/teaching etc. might actually be a really good angle for me to work from. I might not get another opportunity to study abroad again and to get a chance to get involved in something that is so ordinary in terms of your experience but actually so completely alien to me would be fantastic.\n\nThanks again \u2013 I\u2019ll PM you about that drink if I manage to get a place. Dont worry about the drink - in college, they're not that hard to come by. Good luck!  Champaign-Urbana is considered micro-urban, which means it has a small population (&lt;250,000) yet it has characteristics of an urban city.  We have a bus system that takes you to classes and off campus, which is handy if you want to go to shopping, see a movie, etc.\n\nWith over 1200 registered student organizations (RSOs), you're bound to find something that interests you that you can join.  They can be related to your major or completely random, ie the skydiving club called the Falling Illini.\n\nDiversity is also a huge part of UIUC.  I've learned a lot about other cultures just casually from my friends that a class couldn't teach me.\n\nIn short, I've met some of my best friends here, I'm going to take away many amazing memories that I get to keep for a lifetime, and I've learned a lot about myself and others in addition to getting my degree from a great institution.    I can answer your 1st and 3rd questions.\n\n1. I'm not sure if there's really anything \"special\" in the way that LAS is taught here, especially since I can't compare it to anywhere else, but I know that I've felt like my education and the professors are all extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I've never had a weak link in LAS.\n\n3. I would sell Champaign-Urbana. I'm sure you've heard all the typical \"diversity, RSOs, greek system, etc.\" but outside of campus, there are a lot of cool things to do in C-U. It's a cool town with a bumpin' music scene (if you're into that sort of thing). If you do come here, I definitely would suggest stepping out of the campus bubble. The idea that LAS is really solid is actually great to know. I'd sort of hoped I could just say something easy in my application like \"oh yeah, x department is really exceptionally well regarded blah blah blah\" but now I think about it a more interesting angle would be that teaching in general is well regarded and I can be sure that I would be well supported in every regard during my time there.\n\nAwesome - I might have to post again later in the year if I get in to see about hiring a tour guide! It sounds like a really great place to be.  The library system is fantastic.  That is so good to know because the system here at York is. slowly. killing. me. We have ~53 separate libraries (they operate relatively autonomously, though resources are linked) and the staff is knowledgable. You'll like the philosophy and history libraires, if you choose to come here. \n\nTaken together, we're the second largest university library in America, just after Harvard. Third largest library, if we tack on the Library of Congress. \n\nEdit: Oh, and the Rare Books and Manuscripts library is run by a person who actually believes people should be able to touch books. You'll have full access to a very large and substantial rare book collection. Holy shit that's amazing!

You'll have full access to a very large and substantial rare book collection. I agree, our libraries are pretty awesome.  I believe we have the LARGEST collection available to public checkout in the WORLD!  The staff will go out of there way to get you a resource that they currently don't own.  \n\nThis semester I read a preview of a book on Amazon that was published in 2005 and was great resource but wasn't sold anymore on Amazon and UIUC didn't own it, or any I-Share Library (If UIUC dosen't own a book, you can request it from almost any library in Illinois!)  \n\nI told this to the staff and they were able to get a copy from Wisconsin-Madison, I thought that is just awesome!

It's such an interesting and diverse place where I always felt like there was so much to learn if only I had enough time. \n\nI was a history minor and spent all of my time within the college of LAS. It's the largest college within the university although it tends to get overshadowed by flashier colleges such as engineering and business. However, within LAS if you choose your professors wisely you will get some of the best instruction available. I'm not sure how lecture/discussion goes in the UK but here the key to getting the most out of your courses is going up to your professors and getting to know them, showing them your own interest in their subject and they will certainly reciprocate. In fact I had a student from the UK in one of my last history courses and on more than one occasion I witnessed the prof having a really in depth discussion with him about where he was from, what he was interested in academically, etc. I always found professor Micale's classes for 200-300 level HST courses to be really well done. I'm not sure his classes correspond with your interests but he is a fantastic lecturer and great professor. \n\nYou can also search faculty on the history department website to get a feel for different prof's areas of research and instruction. \nhttp://www.history.illinois.edu/people/\n\nAnd finally, not sure if there is something like this in the UK but in the US you're a fool if you don't check ratemyprofessors before selecting courses and profs. \nhttp://www.ratemyprofessors.com/SelectTeacher.jsp?sid=1112\n\nGood luck! And if it's not UIUC I'm sure you'll have more than enough fun within the states :) Thanks so much - it's reat to hear from people who know the department and can recommend particular professors etc. It's also good to know that the \"get to know the professor\" tactic works everywhere!\n\nI'll probaby have less options course wise than a regular student but I reckon it'll be good to be able to talk about specific professors whose classes I woud like to take, even if I don't have the opportunity to actually take them.\n\nI really wish ratemyprofessor was more popular in the UK - it should be such a great resource. I guess I can make good use of it now, thanks for the link!  [deleted]  If I were to sell uiuc to a prospective student, i'd mention a couple things: a diverse student body, relatively inexpensive tuition/cost of living, partying culture (if that's your thing), and good engineering departments.\nI'm a computer science major, so i can't think of anything particularly special about liberal arts program here, so someone else can help out. i wouldn't be too stressed about what to put on the application. what's your actual reason for choosing uiuc? Thanks!\n\nThere's a pretty limited range of exchange programs I can apply for where I'm from and UIUC appealed most. It would make it easier if it was renown for it's history department or something but as it doesn't seem to be I need to be quite clever about the way I present my interest in studying at your shool in particular rather than anywhere else that was on offer. The diversity thing will probably go down well with my board of studies - I'll work that in.\n\nAlso, I'm a first year undergrad currently. If I get in the exchange would occur in the winter term of my second year. The literature I've got from my University says I can sign up for 200 and 300 courses. I should probably have mentioned that before. :) If you're interested in medieval church history, we do have a unique resource: The [largest Newman Center in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Catholic_Newman_Center) and its Institute of Catholic Thought.  I wouldn't gush over them inordinately in the application, since they successfully sued the College of LAS recently, but when you get here or even before you get here, they can point you to the local heavyweights in medieval church history.  1. UofI has a good teaching program. Certainly nothing were really renown for, but one of the best in the area\n2. Can't really speak for it sorry\n3. Anecdotally I know 3 students who came from the UK to study abroad here at UofI. One studied for a year last year and is now back in the UK, and the other two are here now. They have all said on more than a few occasions how glad they are for deciding to come here. \n\nas an important side note (and addition to question 3), you won't have to worry so much about not being legal here in the US if you come to Illinois as you might have to elsewhere. While the drinking age is technically still 21, bars legally allow 19+ to come in and in general people are pretty accommodating of such things ;) i'm really glad to hear that it worked out for other UK students. I've been trying to get in contact with other students who went on the same exchange as me but the Global Study office here won't pass along details.\n\nHa, that's interesting. In the UK just about everything becomes legal to buy when you're 18 so I've been enjoying buying weird liqueur and knives and stuff just because I can without any worry if I get carded. I don't know how university life would function without easy access to terrible booze.  The people you will want to mention:\n- Ralph Mathisen (ecclesiastical history - late antique &amp; early medieval). He's really really eccentric, but if you can put up with his weirdness, you'll benefit. He does a lot of smaller seminars, mixed grads &amp; undergrads. I can say more privately if you want.\n- Anne Hedeman - medieval art historian. (If she's not on sabbatical or something.) You can easily google her to find out her strengths. She's a very nice person &amp; a good scholar.\n- Charlie Wright (yep, Charlie) - Old English, medieval chronicles. Also very kind and a star in his field.\n- Richard Layton - religious studies.   [deleted]  Junior here. Any general things or oddly specific things you'd like to know. I'm up for emailing or what have you. I didn't read all the comments but when are you trying to study here? If it is in the next three semesters I'll be around still. UIUC is a very friendly place and it is impossible to come here without meeting someone - unless you hide under a rock. Thanks so much - I can't think of any questions right now but is it alright if I message you with stuff that comes up? I won't bombard you or anything but its just great to have someone that I can ask stupid questions if I need to.\n\nIf I get a place I'll be there for the winter semester of 2013 (idk the proper terminology). :) Of course! From august to december? We just call it fall here. No worries :) Yeah, August to December. We have a three term system here with ten week terms so the comparisons are a bit awkward. If I get on the program I miss pretty much my entire summer holiday which sucks a bit.

We have a 16 week fall semester (Aug-Dec, like samdilla said), 3-4 weeks winter break, 16 week spring semester (Jan-May) then summer break. (52-(2*16+4) = 16, so I guess around 3-4 months of summer break.) Yeah, August to December I think.\n\nI think I got confused - we have a three term system and essentially I miss a big chunk of summer holiday time and the entirety of what I would refer to as my winter term which runs from September/October to December to take part in the exchange. Me and my flat mates were trying to figure this out but it becomes so awkward with the terminology being so similar on both ends.

I'd recommend just buying a beater car, getting insurance and using it. That's your easiest option. you can't really register a car without license. so... Do you count as a resident of the state? Or do you count as foreign? Only residents must register (I believe), so if you're able to go about it quickly that could be something.\n\nHonestly, you probably should call the DMV and figure it out. ahhhh, im a foreigner. ill check it out, but champaign DMV is not known for their kindness The Caucasian woman at Champaign DMV is reputed to be not very kind to Asians (there is a Caucasian man, a Caucasian woman, and an African-American woman there, or at least, used to be). \n\nFor obtaining a car for the driving test, you could post an ad on Craigslist. I understand your hesitation, but you could do a background check on the people who respond (Google, Facebook, the circuit court webpage if you want to be really sure) and make sure they are reliable. If I see they are affiliated with the university I assume they are likely to be okay. When you practice with the car, you will be the one driving, so it isn't like they can drive you off and kidnap you. At this time there aren't many students on campus, which is probably why you aren't getting many responses on reddit. You will reach a larger audience on Craigslist than on reddit. ..I guess I should try that. Now, what category would that fall in? Any idea?

Someone with a $1200, 1990 model car might be willing to risk lending it to you if you offer enough renumeration. Be careful though, if they sound desperate don't respond.

I'm kind of a book worm, and most likely I will live in the library.(This might change)  In general, I just would have a few points of advice: **College is an opportunity, no more, no less. You aren't guaranteed anything.**\n\nSince you're an adult, profs aren't going to check on you or your progress - the U of I is a research heavy institution, so they're spending their time doing world-class cutting edge research and managing their graduate students. I'm not saying that they aren't nice people, but there's only 24 hours in a day. They will not go to you to ask if you need help - you have to go to them.\n\nThe bill for the U of I is a big one, and they'll charge you for it no matter what you got out of it. Might as well get as much as you can. Keep your finances in check - financial aid will help you out, but that's not a gift, its a loan. You pay all that money back, so spend wisely.\n\nAs far as grades, just do this - you have to have the paradigm to think that this isn't school, this is your job. This is the job that leads to all your other job opportunities. You'll have the resources here. Take advantage of them.\n\nLastly, as a black person myself, I just want to warn you about the one thing that I never really saw coming, but its affected me, even though it shouldn't. I felt like I didn't belong. Not because I wasn't smart enough, but because I didn't have the pedigree of the people around me. I didn't go to schools that weren't as good. No, my mom and dad aren't lawyers. No, my whole family didn't go here. I'm definitely not speaking for everyone - there are many people have had much rougher lives than me, and they made it here and they are amazing for that. However, those feelings of not belonging can have an effect, even though I've never had any negative experiences with white people or any other races at all during my time here, even if those feelings come from the illogical narrative that was inside my head. Don't ever feel like you aren't supposed to be here, or that you're here just as some affirmative action quota. I hope you don't have those attitudes, but if you do, let them go. You wont be admitted because of where you come from, but you'll be here because of where your going. \n\nGood luck to you. &gt; I felt like I didn't belong.\n\nIt's called the [impostor syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), and is a term usually applied to women in graduate school, but I suppose it can affect anyone who belongs to a minority, whether it be due to race, gender, socioeconomic background, etc.  Yes, one of the factors leading to a low self-efficacy. Not a good thing to have, especially in an environment where your performance is standardized against your peers. Its given me some trouble, but I deal with it alright.

From one South Sider to another, welcome!!\n\nFor advice with freshman year, I'd read the sidebar because it's really helpful.  I wouldn't take too many hours the first semester (14-16 is good) because you are making a huge adjustment moving to college and the classes are not like high school.  \n\nSit up front for class because the professor will recognize you.  Also go to office hours.  I did this and got a recommendation from a professor.  You will also have a discussion section, which is taught by a TA.  TA's are usually grad students in that field. It reminds me more of a high school setting where you can ask questions and there's only about 30 students in the class.  That's another resource you can use to do well in classes.  From my own trends, lectures/discussion sections that I've sat up front for and were engaged during class had better grades than the classes I sat in back for.\n\nDefinitely join clubs.  I know some freshman are hesitant to join or they think they shouldn't join in the middle of a semester.  You meet a lot of great people, UIUC seems a bit smaller, and it's a good talking point for interviews, especially if you can get on the exec board.  \n\nIf you have more questions, post them on here or send me a message.  Thank you for the feedback.\n\nHow is the student housing set up? Do you have different options, such as the amount of people you want to dorm with and the environment you would like? Since the other guy didn't address Private Housing, I will. I live in Presby Hall this year and, while quite expensive, it is very nice. It is suite style living, where you live with 4 or 5 other people, share a furnished (except for TV) living room, full kitchen, two bathrooms, a balcony, and then individual or double bedrooms. Stay away from Illini Tower, it's overpriced and the management is awful, they had a debacle earlier this year where their RAs, cafeteria, and other staff quit in protest to treatment. Bromley is another nice option, it's slightly cheaper than Presby and has rooms for each type of set up. Hendrik House has a fantastic food service, but the company that does this food also does Presby and Armory's food service too. Armory, Europa House, Newman and Orthodox Christian are the other co-ed PCHs but I don't know much about them other than Orthodox Christian is a religious dorm and Newman is basically religious, but not officially. There are also a number of single-sex PCH's too. [Check them out here.] (http://certified.housing.uiuc.edu/) Thank you for the feedback.\n\nHow is the student housing set up?

If you are from Chicago, this is the best place to go to. People are friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is relaxed and laidback in general - I don't mean classes are easy, just that UIUC is not cut-throat competitive like, say, Ivy League schools, but provides you with a comparable education. \n\n&gt; I was also wondering what mistakes should I avoid freshman year.\n\nTake your studies seriously, don't party every night, don't take on too many classes or too many extracurricular activities right from your first semester, and seek help early if you find yourself unable to keep up with the pace of classes. \n\n&gt; I was wondering do you guys/gals have any tips for me to make sure I keep my grades intact.\n\nThere have been many posts about academic probation in the last few days - look those up, those threads have good advice and information. It is better to get a head start and hit the ground running with regard to GPA rather than get into a bad place and then try to recover from it.\n\n&gt; Background: African-American from South-side Chicago.\n\nThere is a LOT of diversity on campus - both in quantity and variety. There are many diverse communities, and each of these communities has a fairly large number of members. It is upto you what you want to do - if you want to hang out with people of your race, ethnicity, nationality, department, college, you will find plenty of people in each case. If you want to learn about other cultures and make friends with people from other countries, you can do that too. It is completely upto you, you can do whatever you want to do - stick to your own kind or diversify your friend circle. I think hanging out with people like yourself is natural, easy and effortless (and that is what many people do, Asians hang out with Asians, African-Americans hang out with African-Americans, etc.), and making friends with people very different from yourself might be a little difficult at first, but it is certainly possible with effort, and UIUC provides you plenty of opportunities in that regard if that interests you.  \n\nFinally, however much advice and information you collect, you *will* make mistakes. There will be missteps, errors of judgment, poor decisions - take those in stride and don't freak out. Everyone makes mistakes and learns from them, however prepared and well-informed they are to start with.  &gt; I was wondering are their any negatives that UIUC may hold, because from reading the threads and comments it seems as if this college would make a perfect match.\n\nUIUC is Illinois' flagship university. If you are from Chicago, this is the best place to go to. People are friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is relaxed and laidback in general - I don't mean classes are easy, just that UIUC is not cut-throat competitive like, say, Ivy League schools, but provides you with a comparable education. \n\n&gt; I was also wondering what mistakes should I avoid freshman year.\n\nTake your studies seriously, don't party every night, don't take on too many classes or too many extracurricular activities right from your first semester, and seek help early if you find yourself unable to keep up with the pace of classes. \n\n&gt; I was wondering do you guys/gals have any tips for me to make sure I keep my grades intact.\n\nThere have been many posts about academic probation in the last few days - look those up, those threads have good advice and information. It is better to get a head start and hit the ground running with regard to GPA rather than get into a bad place and then try to recover from it.\n\n&gt; Background: African-American from South-side Chicago.\n\nThere is a LOT of diversity on campus - both in quantity and variety. There are many diverse communities, and each of these communities has a fairly large number of members. It is upto you what you want to do - if you want to hang out with people of your race, ethnicity, nationality, department, college, you will find plenty of people in each case.

Hey there, thanks for considering U of I!\n\nAs far as negatives go, it's a big school so if you want that enviroment where everyone knows each other, then U of I may not be for you.\n\nBut I believe positives are ABUNDANT here, a big school means tons of opportunities. It has a lot of history and tradition so you get a real \"College town\" feel to it(at least I do). Great academics, great towns with Urbana and Champaign, and most of all it away from home!\n\nI happen to graduate from Lane Tech in 10' and am so glad I went away from Chicago for school, it has taught me so much.\n\nIf you have any questions at all, feel free to PM me! I-L-L!\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that I am a Latino Economics major. As far as Diversity, it's just like any other school in that groups tend to clump. We have the 2nd largest enrollment of students from out of the country of all US schools, so it's a pretty nice mix here. Thank you so much! I was also wondering do the professors take time out of their day to connect with students and build relationships? The reason for this question is because, I'm wondering if it's possible to obtain recommendations from professors. \n\nExtra: Will bring my bike be a plus or a negative? Professors always hole something called \"Office Hours\"  once or twice a week. It's basically about a few hours where they sit in their office and you can go to them if you have any questions on homework/exams/class or anything really. I'd use those opportunities to build relationships if you really like the professor.\n\nA bike is always a plus, just make sure you get a REALLY good lock with it. Not those crappy wire ones, those bikes usually end up getting stolen. Thank you so much! I was also wondering do the professors take time out of their day to connect with students and build relationships?

It depends on the professor, but you may be pleasantly surprised. I went to a professor about an exam conflict, and the conversation ended up with him inviting me to lunch because he doesn't get to meet many students from my class (Econ 103, I highly recommend it). It's really up to you to make the first move and go to office hours.\n\nI have found that having a bike has been very helpful. &gt; I have found that having a bike has been very helpful.\n\nSo have I, a bike is very useful on this campus. Be on the lookout for cops though, don't break any bike-related rules when they're around, they could give you a ticket. You could say that you almost don't need a bike on campus. You can take the free MTD bus system. You can walk everywhere too; I can reach one end of campus from another in about 20-30 minutes. It's not that you can't get around campus without a bike - far from it, really. It's just that (at least in my experience) it is more convenient to have a bike available, even if you don't use it all the time.  What do you want to major in? I'm planning on majoring in International Affairs with a minor in political science or vice-versa. Plan B is majoring in Business Administration and minoring in political science. I'm looking to get into Law School. \n\nIs it possible to change majors before you start class as a freshman? (I might go with plan B)  You'll have to wait until you've completed two semesters to switch majors. Definitely come to UIUC though, I'm sure you'll love it here! Thanks! Thanks! I'm planning on majoring in International Affairs with a minor in political science or vice-versa. Plan B is majoring in Business Administration and minoring in political science. I'm looking to get into Law School. \n\nIs it possible to change majors before you start class as a freshman? (I might go with plan B)  Don't major in business. You will be positioned much better later on if your undergrad is in almost anything else and then you get an MBA. Poli-Sci is a very typical major for pre law, which means you'll really need to stand out in some other way if you want to get into a good school. It's a long way off, but you do: a school's rank matters a *lot* when getting a job after a JD. what major would you suggest? I was thinking of majoring in international affairs and minoring political science. Why is a business major bad  A BBA or MBA is supposed to teach you how to manage a business or a segment of one. The problem is that that's a giant task with many different things involved, so they try to teach you some econ, some finance, some marketing and some accounting, and then they add on things like management strategies. The thing is that it's mostly bullshit. Some of those things are sort of useful, but what gets you ahead in business is making connections and knowing how to deal with people in the way they need to be treated. The best way to know how to deal with a particular group is to have experience being *in* that group. That's why the best MBA programs don't accept people straight out of undergrad: they want you to go out and do things in the business world, *then* come learn how to be a manager. So what do you do? You get a degree in something else which will get you a job in business and go get that experience. If you want to manage engineers you get an engineering degree. If you want to manage accountants you get an accounting degree. Marketers, sales people, technicians... it's all the same. The problem with a BBA is that you don't get any of that. You're just getting the business administration side of things without anything to back it up. You'll be able to get a job from there, but you'll be missing an advantage that someone who went the other way has.\n\nWhat you *should* do if you're thinking about business school is take a bunch of classes in that direction. Take all the econ, finance, marketing, etc that you can fit in along the way. It will look great, and help you be a more rounded candidate for jobs or graduate school later on.\n\nAs far as what major I suggest, it depends what you want to do. One thing I don't understand is your combination of IA or poli-sci with the business degree. Those majors are more suited to an M*P*A program, or to a JD. They are particularly good for public policy law (same reason they'd be good for an MPA program). If that's what you want to do, then go for it. They're not bad majors, but there will be tons of people applying to law school with one or the other of those backgrounds. You'll just need to make sure you stand out. Make absolutely certain that your grades are high (3.7+ minimum) and get involved in social or political activism when you're an undergrad. Show that you aren't just another good student doing the minimum work and you'll be fine.\n\nSorry about the novel. I don't mean to overwhelm you before you've even graduated high school! This was great and my plan is to work in public policy, and try to work my way up. Now, I was thinking of business due to the sheer number of people that are applying to law school. If law school wasn't going to work out I figured I could fall back on my business degree to find a job, because international affairs or political science I hear it's hard to find jobs that accept those majors.\n\n I'm planning on majoring in International Affairs with a minor in political science or vice-versa.

There's no influence of Lake Michigan, so the temps fluctuate wildly in the spring and fall too. If the only complaints people can think of are weather and odors, then I think this is a pretty good university. :)  [deleted]  [deleted] [deleted] [deleted]  one negative i can think of is armed robberies.  [deleted] Classes in the political science department can be hit or miss, but your mileage *will* vary depending on the amount of effort that you put in.\n\nThe professors  are trying to bridge the gap between \"traditional\" undergraduate PS (This is a government, this is a first past the post voting system and it's different from an alternative vote system, etc) with what is actually done at the graduate level (how does democratization affect economic development in XYZ ways?). Unfortunately, how well that connection comes across depends on 1. the organization of the course 2. how much prior knowledge the student comes in with and 3. how much effort the student is willing to put in to understanding the material. I rate 1 and 3 as being the primary determinants of your experience *and* performance.\n\nMy advice, if you are \"stuck\" in the political science department, is as follows:\n\n1. During registration and during the first part of the semester, ask the undergraduate advisors about classes that can best expand your knowledge base and are suited to your interests. \n\n2. When it comes out, check the \"Incomplete list of teachers and TAs rated as excellent\" for an idea of instructors that you may want to learn from.\n\nWhen in class:\n\n3. **COME TO CLASS.** Don't slack off just because the professor posts slides. His lecture should provide linking material to help you understand how the concepts hang together. It's an hour out of your day, three times a week. Hey, if the professor and the TAs can do it (and keep in mind that they also have other classes, research and LIFE, which often includes spouses/children/pets, on top of teaching you), you can too.\n\n4. **GO TO OFFICE HOURS.** Visit, email, whatever. The TAs and the Professor want to help. They will be much more understanding *if you have expressed your concerns and have demonstrably tried to work on them beforehand*.\n\n5. Take it all seriously. Don't only take tests seriously, blow off homeworks, then be enraged when you get a B-. The same thing goes for discussion section. \n\n6. Put some effort into class. It's not hard to tell if you're on Facebook/Tumblr/Twitter. \n\n7. Be prepared to think critically. The surface may consist of definitions and formulae to be learned, but the deeper level evaluates your ability to apply what you have learned to formulate arguments. These cannot be memorized or looked for on Wikipedia the night before.\n\n8. Be prepared to step out of your comfort zone. This is a continuation of the point above. Thinking critically may mean that others in turn will take apart your argument to evaluate its assumptions, its internal logic, etc. Arguing via political slogans without clear justification for your position is not going to win you any points in class.\n\nI'll stop here for now. Good luck.\n\nSource: I'm a Political Science TA. [deleted] :( I think it's to late to transfer over to business as my main major.

It's not like we get to go to games for free. Couple thoughts.  First of all, I agree with you, lots of students work their asses of with extracurricular activities.  And I think the football palum who said something along the lines of 'try walking a day in our shoes' gives current and former U of I athletes a bad name.  I'm fully aware that loads of people would have gladly worked their asses off to compete for U of I.  \n\nThe difference that I think is pretty important to note in regards to working/extracurricular vs sports is the time myself and many other athletes missed in the classroom.  I regularly had to miss classes/exams for competitions, hence the reason the DIA provides us with tutors.  With that said, I also regularly attended office hours too.  As a track athlete, I knew getting a degree was more important to my future than sports. \n\nAs far as Illini Athletics, the quick source I pulled from '09 said:\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget. \n\nwhich seems to show it's not quite as shaky as you're implying, those years including some garbage on the football and bball court\n\n[source](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)  I didn't mean to imply that Illinois particularly is in bad shape, but just wanted to illustrate that a general trend in college athletics is very thin margins that disappear very fast for a lot of places. As for your link, it says Illinois was in the black for the 17th straight year at the end of 08-09, but that doesn't mesh with the N-G article I linked to which said that in 1997, the DIA was $1.3 million dollars in the red. One possibility is that under normal operations the DIA was scheduled or budgeted to run $1.3mln in the red in 97, but that passing the student fee then helped alleviate that.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that oftentimes non-athletes, like myself, overlook that athletes don't get to set their schedules the way a regular working student would so thanks for bringing that up. It's a lot easier to get a work/internship schedule around class and impossible to say, \"schedule this Big Ten conference matchup on another day please\" since athletes have no control over that.

It's the basketball and football folks who are the most well known and most likely to receive different treatment, wittingly or unwittingly, from people eager to see the big programs succeed.\n\n\nLastly, I'll note that someone in the comments on the DI article mentioned that the DIA is self-sustaining, but I would urge anyone who hasn't in the past to read up on athletic departments at major and non-major universities and colleges around the country. A couple of bad football/basketball seasons and then those same athletic departments are deep in the red feeding on the teat of the school. Just to think about it in a UIUC context for a moment, we may be asked in the upcoming student elections to add a fee for helping renovate Assembly Hall. Shouldn't the DIA have a better capital plan then relying on students for [nearly a fifth](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/university-illinois/2013-02-09/group-seeks-student-vote-fee-160-million-assembly-hall-renovatio) of costs? It's not like we get to go to games for free. Assembly hall is for far more than just the athletics.  One of the proposed features is air conditioning to host summer concerts and events.  Why should DIA have to pay for that?  Pretty impressive how ignorant and self serving this article is\n\nEdit: Also impressive how out of control reaction is getting That's why I posted it... I'm friends with some people in athletics who freaked the fuck out.   Honestly, I think this all could mostly be resolved if the players were allowed to get paid like every other profession. College sports are really messed up in this way. Colleges provide special treatment to their athletes to attract and sustain good athletes because good athletes are cash cows to the universities.\n\nLet the athletes get paid, and people like this writer will see the economic worth of certain athletes. Also, then the athletes don't need to be afforded special treatment.   Is Irwin open to all students? I saw a comment on the article saying that it was....but I didn't think so. I have heard of group projects happening there and student athletes inviting everyone to work at Irwin, but that's about it. It is open to all RSOs you must reserve a time spot which is pretty competitive but still open to people who are not NCAA athletes     Another gem from the DI....   The author doesn't seem to realize that the school needs these incentives to attract good athletes to the school, so the sports programs can continue to generate revenue for the school. You've been lied to my friend. You've bought into the mythos that College Athletics (a) make a profit, and (b) that profit (if it exists) is returned to the academic portion of the university. There are relatively few (think 4 or 5) universities in the nation where both (a) &amp; (b) occur. U of I is not one of those schools. \n\nWe, students/taxpayers/property owners, subsidize the costs of student athletes and collegiate athletics. It comes out of our tuition and taxes (sales/income/property). Any source for these claims?  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/story/2012-05-14/ncaa-college-athletics-finances-database/54955804/1\n\nIf you consider the subsidy, it's pretty much even. Thanks for the source, but those number still show that the athletic department made a profit. \n\n[This one states that as of '09:](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget.  Not sure what your point is.. Not yourself, but ewat85 claimed that the athletic department operates at a deficit, which is the reason I requested a source.  Your source says ewat85 is wrong.  I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem. The fact that I cannot show you a source has been the product of law review articles for decades. Because college Athletic Departments, and college athletics themselves, fall under the exempt function of each university there are very few requirements placed upon their financial accounting and reporting practices. As such, there is relatively little oversight into the expenses and revenue that the universities claim to be making and spending. The line between athletic and academic expenses is a blurry one and is being abused by most, if not all, universities in this country.\n\n\nFirst let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. It is written to give you the impression that they made a ton of money. Now, look through the PDF provided with that statement. Where, under the finances section, does it say that U of I took in more revenue then it spent? Nowhere. Why is that? Because it's a BS statement. \n\nHow can we be sure that it is bullshit? Because under the finance section the total revenue and total expenses are exactly equal, down to the dollar. Go talk to a CPA, a business owner, an auditor, a tax attorney, anyone with oversight over a budget. Ask them how often total expenditures match total expenses. Now ask them how often it happens two years in a row. The answer will be NEVER. It never happens, and it ABSOLUTELY NEVER happens when your budget is $70+ million. So how is it possible for it to happen here? I mean surely U of I can't just lie about these numbers.\n\nIn fact, they can. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a 501(c)(3) organization. It is tax exempt as both a government entity and as an education institution. The university files a form 990 every year in which they tell the IRS how much they make, how much their assets are worth, etc. etc. etc., what they don't tell them, and what they need not tell them, is how much money comes from each of their activities. It isn't required. Athletics is considered a tax exempt function and therefore is not broken down on the Form 990. The only information one receives is a single line under \"Miscellaneous Income\" that says \"Athletics Receipts.\" What does that mean? What is and is not included in \"Athletics Receipts.\" I can't find U of I's 2008 or 2009 return but in 2011-2012 U of I claimed ~ $3.5 million in athletics receipts. Lets just assume that U of I retained its perfect harmony on revenue and expenses for last year (which it will). What then is this $3.5 million in receipts? If expenses = revenue, what makes up this 3.5 million dollars? Why will this amount likely not be its own line on the DIA annual report? \n\nYour looking at this and saying \"So, what does any of this prove?\" \n\nSo... this shows you how little oversight there is. Athletics Receipts means something to the IRS but isn't a notation on the DIA expenses form. Expenses reported to the NCAA are different from expenses reported to the Department of Education, and different from expenses reported through the DIA. \n\nThere is no standardized accounting principle being employed by all the universities in the nation right now. There is no harmony between the numbers reported by the same institution to various organizations collecting data. What does this show? It shows that we have no idea what is being spent and where that money is coming from. Furthermore, there is little to no transparency within the Athletic Directors office. If U of I was doing such a great job of \"breaking even\" or \"turning a profit\" every year, one would think that they would be more than happy to release their books to the public. They don't and they won't. AD's are playing a shell game and they'll continue to do so until there is standardization, OR, until we once and for all treat college athletics like the money making enterprise it is and tax it. Until that time creative accounting will be used to hide the true costs of athletics from the people who are paying the price.\n\n\nSo, that wasn't very substantive, I know. However we can move on to a more concrete portion of my claim. If we take the USA Today table as true (which I would dispute) then you see that U of I averages ~$4 million in subsidies every year, or, $20 million from 2006 to 2011. That is money that comes from students and taxpayers. So ... that proves I'm correct at least to the extent that I claim that we, collectively, are subsidizing the Athletic Department. \n\n\nNow, I have a question for you. If U of I's athletic program gives back so much to the university, then, there should be some record of it somewhere. Why is it so hard to find that record?   I dont know, but you have my upvote - this was an incredibly well written explanation that deserves more upvotes than the athletics apologists in this thread. I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem.

If U of I's athletic program gives back so much to the university, then, there should be some record of it somewhere. Why is it so hard to find that record?   You're mostly just rambling here. This statement alone is enough nonsense to discredit everything else you said:\n\n&gt; First let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. \n\nThat's not at all what that statement claims.  That's not what 'budget' means.  Even still, you've already lost all credibility by saying the athletic department operates at a deficit when sources prove otherwise. \n\nThe DIA pays for nearly everything with it's own revenue and donations from former athletes, such as myself, and not from your tax dollars or tuition costs.  Even without the subsidy, the athletic department made a profit. \n\nWith that said, these claims are far from the arguments brought up in the initial article.  You've been lied to my friend. You've bought into the mythos that College Athletics (a) make a profit, and (b) that profit (if it exists) is returned to the academic portion of the university. There are relatively few (think 4 or 5) universities in the nation where both (a) &amp; (b) occur. U of I is not one of those schools. \n\nWe, students/taxpayers/property owners, subsidize the costs of student athletes and collegiate athletics. It comes out of our tuition and taxes (sales/income/property). I wasn't aware that was the case here; however, the athletics benefit the school in other ways you may not have thought of.  For instance, it gives the school national attention, and sells lisenced merhandise.  Both of these things attract students who in turn pay those fees and taxes.  Just having your schools name out there increases applications. Out of state students also pay way higher tuition.  I do agree with your main point that the benefit of sports programs is overhyped.\n\nTyped on my phone in case there's grammar nazis.

Isnt it snobberish to tell people how to behave on a college subreddit?   My brain suffering from chronic lack of caffeine told me the title read \"snot in the sub\" and I came in looking to find out whether it was Jimmy Johns, Silver mine, subway, or the penn station. I'm relieved to learn that it was just me being stupid.   It's hardly a circlejerk here. I say this as someone who is far from the core demographic: female and a Social Work major. I have never felt unwelcome in this subreddit due to snobbery or other reasons. Most of the snobbery you perceive is probably intended as humor. The only troublesome aspect of this subreddit is occasional racism, since even if something is meant as a joke, it can still be hurtful and unwelcoming. Also, I wish /r/uiuc had more members who are in non-STEM related majors, but this is reddit. Undergrad in TESLand Linguistics. Gogo minority majors! Yay.

Engineering is slightly harder than bashing a rival bus company and being nasty to passengers, so you might want to back off.  Apparently everyone is disagreeing with you, but I think you're right.  Examples plox? Calling the subreddit \"circlejerk central or dogs devouring dissenters left and right\" is a pretty hefty claim. Sorry, that's just me novelizing what I see, not nearly as bad as that phrase makes it. But I'm not going to single out a poster and put the blame on them. Again, it's more just mentality that slightly leaks through tone than blatant posts.  Give us examples you passive aggressive LAS pussy. /s\n\nedit: but seriously. give us some examples. wtf is LAS.

I wanna ask all the physics undergrads and grads here: what's it like being a major in physics? and: What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? Do u feel worried that you won't find a job? Do you question your decision at times? What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?   I wasn't a student here, but I can answer some of your more general questions.\n\n&gt;What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? \n\nGrades, research experience, recommendation letters, subject GRE scores. An admissions person (at a *very* highly ranked school) told me once that they're looking for people who have at least three of those rated excellent or two outstanding.\n\n&gt;Do u feel worried that you won't find a job?\n\nNot really, but I'm not interested in a faculty position. The unemployment rate for physics PhDs is around 1%. If you're willing to sell your soul to the semiconductor or defense industries or go to the financial sector, you won't have any trouble. One of my friends who washed out of grad school (aka left with a masters) went and got a medical physics degree and is now quite happy doing medical imaging.\n\n&gt;Do you question your decision at times?\n\nI probably should have been an engineer or a chemist, but that's just me. I haven't closed any doors, but I certainly haven't been on the fastest path to get where I think I'm heading.\n\n&gt;What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?\n\nGet exposure to as many fields as you can. You never know what's going to actually strike a chord with you.  \n\nGet involved in research as soon as you can, but don't be afraid to change labs if it's a bad fit. That goes for grad school as well.  \n\nTake courses outside what's required. You never know when knowing how to write an efficient algorithm, speak a foreign language or quote classic literature is going to help you -- those are all real examples from my career so far!\n\nRelated to that: cross disciplinary work is the future for the sciences. Learn how to talk to chemists, biologists, etc. They're going to speak a very different language from you, especially in terms of mathematics. Who would you recommend a physics major too? As in, I am passionate about physics but am not sure if I have a very romanticized view of physics. What are some misconceptions that you might have had about a physics major that came up by surprise?     Senior in majoring in Engineering Physics atm. \n\nI came in with ap credit for Calc I and phys 211. I chose to take phys 211 to start where most other people did. The phys 211-214 courses weren't tough to me. I was in the first phys 225 course and enjoyed it because of the instructors that taught it at that time. I then took phys 325, and while it was tough, thoroughly enjoyed it because it was my first real physics course. Beyond this I have taken all of the regular physics curriculum (E&amp;M: 435/436, Quantum: 486/487, Stat Mech: 427, Labs: 401/403) and then some others (Thesis track: 496/499, Subatomic: 470), plus some upper astronomy courses. If you have questions on those feel free to ask. A lot of my time was working homework sets that could take anywhere from 1 to 10 hours depending on the course/professor. \n\nGraduate schools look at your GPA, GRE, PGRE (GRE physics subject test), research conducted, letters of recommendation, and personal statement. If you want to attend graduate school you should have some research done as an undergrad. This is not hard to obtain though. You can either go knocking on professors' doors or apply to external research programs such as REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates). I did both, first by asking around the department when I was a sophomore to do research over that summer. Then by applying to REUs and getting to accepted to one at the Uni of Neb-Lincoln. I did physics and astronomy education research during these projects. Besides research you'll want some strong letters of recommendation which you can obtain from professor by doing research or being a really good student in their course (going to office hours, answering questions, etc.). Basically getting them to know your name and yourself. The other credentials come down to you studying and working hard in your courses and preparing for the standardized tests if you need too. \n\nI do not feel worried that I won't find a job because I'm choosing to stay in academia, a.k.a. going to graduate school. I was worried at first that I wouldn't get into a graduate school, so I applied to 11 schools. Some were \"safety\" schools, while others were hard to reach programs. I have gotten into several schools and will make my decision later this semester. I do not regret my decision to pursue graduate school because I am passionate about research and know this is what I want to do after talking to multiple professors about staying in academia. If you're interested in doing graduate school for physics keep this in mind, most programs will fund you if you are choosing to pursue a doctorate degree (which takes about 5-7 years). They will fund you through either a teaching assistant-ship, research assistant-ship, fellowship, or scholarship. For example, for the several places I've been accepted they are offering me a full tuition wavier and a stipend for being a teaching assistant during the school year. \n\nFor advice, I would say make sure physics is something you are passionate about. If you do not know what field you are interested in, start going to colloquiums here to get an idea of what each subfield is like. Also, you can get an idea about which field you like when you take the respective courses. For advice on finding research, just start asking professors through email, or knock on their door and ask them in person.  Don't give up and keep trying. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot give advice on being in graduate school, but I'm sure others can help with that. \n\nIf you have any specific questions about the undergraduate program here, feel free to ask.  Can you tell us what schools you applied to and where you got in. Really want to gauge myself to see where im headed for grad school. If you could give us info about the critical stuff (GPA, GRE, PGRE, LoRs, Research Experience) will be super helpful.

Most people have blown it out of proportion due to overuse of crime alerts. I feel the campus is quite safe.  Most people have blown it out of proportion due to overuse of crime alerts. Agreed, I used to go on long walks late at night on the Urbana side of campus and never once felt remotely threatened.  I don't know, maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to do, but some people act like if you step foot outside after dark you are _definitely_ going to get mugged/murdered/raped.  Okay, first strike, don't carry large amounts of cash. In addition to possibly being robbed, you can also lose it. TCF and the UIUC Credit Union have free checking accounts for students and they give you a debit card. Use them. You can cancel a lost/stolen debit card. You can't get cash back if you lose it or it is stolen. \n\nSecondly, the only place I'd feel unsafe at night is north of University or on Green St at like 4am. But don't be an idiot. Be aware of your surroundings.  Don't use a checking account to store money in a bank if safety concerns you. It's not hard for someone to mug you at an ATM and force you to withdraw $1000 in less than a minute. Instead, you want to get a savings account attached to your bank account and only store a necessary amount in the checkings account. There's no way to access the savings account at an ATM. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I think they used to be much more separate than they are now. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I used to deposit my pay checks directly to my checkings account at the local bank and a bank teller once told me that it was \"not safe\" for me to have all my money in a checkings account for this reason. Perhaps she was just trying to get me to start a savings account? I'm assuming you're right.  I don't know much about banking, but if I had to guess I'd say banks can't invest with your checking but can with savings.  That's probably why savings generate interest and most checking accounts don't. Banks can't legally invest in regular savings accounts, that's why the return on them is shit.  There is no risk in checking or savings.   In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal.

There's usually a $500 daily ATM withdrawal limit on those, so no. Right, because losing $500 is something you brush off. \n\nEDIT: Sorry, I misread Perrys comment and thus misunderstood yours. You are right, carry on.  I merely refuted his statement about checking accounts and a thousand bucks. Chill out. What part of that comment made you think I'm not chill? I'm falling asleep as I type. \n This is just beyond stupid. Please go on. Ok...? Did you not start it with your comment you thought was funny? Making more friends, I see.

Saferides are pretty awesome and free. Use them      Springfield and Gregory is quite safe.  I spent 2 years living on Springfield and Lincoln (and two years before that right over on Springfield and Green, and then one year after that just a block over on Springfield and Coler), never any issues in the area.  I'd say don't go North of University in the middle of the night and you're fine.  I feel much less safe south of Green st and West of 6th to be honest.\n\nIn general though, if you can avoid walking around alone in the middle of the night, do so.   I lived at stoughton and harvey, a block north from what you say... i never really had any problems... public safety building right there. but... keep south of university. also, who carries cash these days? There are very few crimes north of University unless you're near the student housing on Lincoln. No one's around looking for trouble since it's just a neighborhood. I walk back from downtown Champaign down Washington/Beslin/Fairview a couple times a year, and mostly it's nice old ladies out watering their flowers and some kids on bikes... It just looks super shady. Walk through the neighborhood at night alone when it gets warmer out.

Finishes with a touch of smoke.\n\n* Spring in Amarillo - A red ale dominated by a fruity maltiness and finishing with a touch of citrus from the exclusive use of Amarillo hops.\n\n* Blueberry Blonde - Our Light blonde with a twist: lots of blueberry. This pink/purple ale features a sweet, blueberry aroma. Flavored with blueberry juice and a touch of blueberry concentrate for aroma.\n\n* Pale Ale - One of our many pale ale recipes, this iteration contains a mix of piney and spicy hops. While it finishes decidedly crisp and bitter, there is also a persistent maltiness for balance.\n\n* Skajaquada - \"Ska-jack-wa-dah\" is our take on a Cascadian Dark Ale. While dark, almost black in color, it lacks the roasty, acrid character usually associated with black beers and instead features copious amounts of hops giving it a firmly bitter finish.\n\n* Valentine - Demonstrating our seasonal whimsy, this chocolate cherry stout was brewed especially for our February opening. Aged on a combination of all-natural Montmorency cherry puree and cocoa nibs, this is truly a dessert beer. Served on nitrogen for a creamy, luscious finish.  I don't hit reddit often but when someone mentioned this thread in the tasting room last night, I thought I would bite.\n\nI am the head brewer at Triptych, one of the three owners, and I suppose you can ask me anything. Here are some answers to the other questions:\n\n* What is the deal with the low ABV beers?\n\nAs someone else already mentioned, ABV doesn't really correspond to flavor. Our tasting room is meant to be a place you can hang out for a while, play a game of chess/cribbage/cards/whatever, and since it is the middle of winter and a little bit off the beaten path, I thought it might be nice to have some beers that you can enjoy quite a lot of without getting hammered. I did this with mostly British styles, following the tradition of a British \"session\", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking Also, I knew a lot of our initial visitors would be our Kickstarter supporters, many of whom were friends and family that while they appreciate our dream, they aren't quite craft beer enthusiasts yet, and so I wanted to have a range that they could enjoy as well.\n\n* Perhaps super high alcohol beers take longer to brew?\n\nThe time difference is pretty negligible, the answer is pretty much the same. I wanted to encourage some social session engagement without making it impossible for people to get back home after an evening at the tasting room. When spring and summer start rolling around and it becomes biking weather, I'll put some more higher abv beers on.\n\n* Growlers\n\nFills are currently between $14-16. And until March 2nd, we're participating in a food drive so if you bring in a non-perishable canned good, we're taking a buck off a growler fill. We sell growlers but we are also happy to fill ANYONE ELSE's 64oz growler too.\n\n* Future beers\n\nI have a significant stable of beer recipes; the idea is that every couple of weeks there is something new on tap at the tasting room. Immediately coming up we have an Imperial IPA and an English Pale ale. Following that will be a number of German lagers. We also have a couple of beers aging in Buffalo Trace Bourbon barrels.\n\nI hope folks will give us a chance. I think our prices are competitive with craft offerings you find elsewhere and as someone else mentioned, we've tried to set up a space/place/brewery that is pretty much all about beer.  Why are all these beers such low ABV? 3%? That's less than bud light. Not too appealing to me.  &gt; - 3. Spring in Amarillo\n&gt; \n&gt; Red Ale, 30 IBU, 5.9% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 6. Pale Ale\n&gt;\n&gt; American Pale Ale, 47 IBU, 4.6% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 7. Skajaquada\n&gt;\n&gt; Cascadian Dark Ale, 90 IBU, 6.8% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 8. Valentine\n&gt; Cherry Chocolate Stout, 23 IBU, 6% ABV\n\nThere might be some correlation with just opening and not having super high alcohol beers. Perhaps they take longer to brew? I saw that. Still somewhat low for what they are in my opinion. Your point is definitely valid. For me, drinking a 3% ABV sounds like drinking water, especially at the cost I imagine they are charging for them.

I can't stand this response. It's possible to get through any program here sleeping 12 hours a day. You just can't do anything else. If you'd actually like to push yourself and take advantage of the ridiculous tuition, *try*. It gets easier in a couple months, and you're actually doing shit. Not sure I agree.  I feel I do more than most of my peers here.  I tend to do 15 hours of all technical classes per semester, plus a 20 hour a week part time job and an EOH exhibit.  Sure I'm not really in RSO's (except a few brief ACM stints), but like I said I have a plenty active social life on top of the resume crap.  I actually get much more done sleeping 7-9 hours than I did sleeping 3.  That's not to say that I never pull the odd all-nighter when deadlines pile up, but I really think that your cognitive skills decrease with lack of sleep and though you can convince yourself you're doing more you're actually limiting academic performance and in my experience mental health (I've had some pretty intense depersonalization periods after a few months of &lt;3hrs/night). Like I said, it gets better after a couple months. And there are plenty of ways to avoid the dead end thinking that happens during severe sleep deprivation, not the least of which is doing work with classmates. I'm extremely active in a number of RSOs, while founding another. It makes it worth it. That being said, I've also been sick relatively often, and the crashes over breaks are hard. So there may be a better middle ground. Ummm... just don't.  Get sleep.  You can do it.

I'm at community college right now too, and I expected to get straight As but I ended up doing just as bad as I had been doing at U of I, two Ds and a B last semester, not even a full time student.

If I was the readmission person in charge of reviewing your application, and you said exactly what you just said, I would have no problem with bringing you back in. Further, you admit that there were some classes you had difficulty with. That's no biggie. I did community college for a few semesters and not everything was As. As long as you're upfront about it, and explain what was difficult, I bet you'll be good (I had problems with discrete math, it just wasn't my forte). I do hope to write something similar in my petition although in the actual directions for the petition it warns against superficial claims. This makes me worry that some of the stuff won't be taken seriously when it's actually huge change/improvement for me. Either way your post made me feel good and a little more optimistic! Thank you!  Yes.  I made an appointment to talk to the department's Dean personally, so I could talk over the circumstances that had led to my awful semester, the game plan for improving my performance and keeping myself on track, and generally just try to make the best impression possible.  It worked.  I was dropped in spring 12 also, and I'm trying to transfer to UIC because I think it might be easier to get into. Am I wrong? Is it still the same process since it is within the University of Illinois system? I never looked into UIC.\n\nedit: By same process I mean; do you fill out a petition or is it like applying to any other University? I think it's like applying to another University. They do ask if you've been in the U of I system to provide your UIN, so it's different in that aspect. Hopefully since I've been in the system they'll accept me.  I was dropped and readmitted in 2004. I had some time to show that I had become more responsible and was ready to make the appropriate commitment. Before reapplying I spoke with a counselor who reminded me that I was let into the university originally because they thought I was capable. Focusing on your growth and changes you've made, as Hippity suggested, is really sound advise. Remember your previous success and don't doubt you can do it. I was nervous reapplying but when I got back in, it was like a new lease on life. Good luck! Numerous counselors have given me the exact same advice. Whenever I get down on myself I think about that and it gives me hope. They let me in this University once, it shouldn't be unreasonable to think that I could make it back. It's nice to hear from someone who made it back! Thanks!  Yep. I did just that and an in my 1st full year back after doin a year at a CC. I spoke to my counselor during the reapplication period to make sure all my T's were crossed and I's dotted, and I heard back within around 2 weeks. If you can give them some solid and legitimate reasoning behind why you were dropped and how you plan to change that I've heard the odds are typically good for readmittance.  Just wondering. What do you mean by crossing T's and dotting I's? I've spoken with the secretary for the deans at engineering hall about getting the actual petition form and then again to clear up some questions I had, but I've never actually sat down and talked my situation through with someone.

I transferred into engineering after attending Parkland for 2 years, no one I knew who applied to transfer to an engineering program got denied (granted everyone I knew who was applying at a 3.0 or higher).  From what I have heard, it is actually easier to transfer from another school than to transfer from another college at UIUC.  If I had to do it over again, I would start at Parkland again, the quality of teaching for the basic calculus and physics is worlds better than what I saw at UIUC.   I transferred into Computer Engineering after 3 semesters at a community college. I've been told the same thing, outside transfers are easier (as long as you're an Illinois resident). [deleted] Are you sure you want to transfer that late? Why not apply to transfer for this coming fall? I see no benefit in waiting another 1.5 years. I'm getting a full ride at UIC right now (grants cover everything) and by the time I transfer for Junior year I'll have $15k+ saved from my job, which would put me on track for graduating with zero debt. So there's that.  The CS department has an increasing enrollment, and is trying to prevent hordes of students from transferring in, and in particular, it is going to be harder to do it in the future. This said, if you have high GPA - you are always going to be able to transfer in. After all - why would CS not want to accept *good* students?\n\nThis said, if you got accepted to CE in ECE then it is very similar to CS. It is a good program in a good department, and you should completely go for it.\n  Are you Undeclared as in you are in DGS or in Undeclared as in the new Undeclared option for Engineering?   I am in the same boat. \n\nhttp://provost.illinois.edu/programs/advising/ICT%20Engineering.html\n\n\nThis should help. Notice that there is **no GPA that guarantees transfer** to engineering, please. And a 3.0 is not a trivial task when your schedule is calculus, physics, chemistry, and rhetoric. So what is the relevance of my link? Is it a guideline or...? It's a minimum. If you read it closely, you'll note that it says if you meet those requirements they \"will consider\" you for transfer.  So what are more realistic requirements? If a person can maintain an A/B/B+ average while completing all of the Junior year transfer requirements, and demonstrate that they taught themselves the basics of a programming language in their free time by then - that's a pretty good indication of probable success completing the degree. It is a difficult program, but it's worth it and very doable with dedication.  I know people who have done it, but I'm sure it's hard. Also you contribute to the overscheduling of classes (as in there are too many people who sign up for classes and there aren't enough seats.) But good luck, the CS program is awesome. It's not too bad. Did it fall of last year, and all Herzog wanted was to see if I did well in CS 173, CS 225, and ECE 190.  What was your GPA?    also consider the Math and Computer Science and Statistics and Computer Science programs, as both are LAS. No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option It doesn't hold the same value, or students don't perceive it to hold the same value. Nobody ever asked me what department I got my degree in. Just what I got.  They don't have to ask if it's on your resume \"BS in Mathematics and Computer Science\" doesn't sound any worse than \"BS in Computer Science.\" No one is going to pay attention to whether your degree comes from LAS/Engineering.  No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option  Me too :/ Except civil engineering, is it any different for me than OP?  Undecided student here. CS is hard as hell to transfer into. The GPA requirement doesn't seem like it's that hard, but it is much harder than it looks. A B- is actually weighed as a 2.67, not a 3, so be wary of that as well. Also, the GPA requirement is more like a 3.2 for CS, not 3.0 So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in? So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in? So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in?   Can anyone explain the differences between the Mathematics and Computer Science program in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as opposed to the one in the College of Engineering? Applied for EE but didn't get into the program and am considering either majors to submit. As the majors state, the LAS one takes more advanced Math classes as opposed to even more advanced CS classes in Engineering. Engineering's CS program only requires all the Calc courses, Linear Algebra, and I believe a Probability Theory class.\n\nEngineering also requires you to take the Physics track (PHYS 211/212 and your choice of 213 or 214) and CHEM 102/103 for their college requirement. \n\nIn the end, they're about equal. Graduates from both programs should show success and proficiency in their future careers.\n\nI dug up some flowcharts.

I would say it is at least two times harder to get an A in ECE classes than in CS classes....\n\nOverall, CS rocks, ECE sucks  (Assume you are not interested in Eletrical of Physic stuffs..).

They sometimes bring cookies to classes! They are funny and experienced unlike the serious ECE professors who has no verbal skills and always get you bored!\n\nNever ever never switch your major to ECE, if you are already, switch to CS instead!If you can't, at least do a CS minor for getting a job...

I am currently a junior in Economics, with concentrations in Eastern Religious Studies, Mathematics, Japanese.\n\nI am running for the Illinois Student Senate because I am tired of the failed policies of old, and would like to bring in a fresh perspective. I will be graduating in May 2014, and therefore do not have to worry about re-election. This will allow me to be more free in my criticism of university policies, as well as fight for YOUR rights as a student. I understand that this may seem like typical campaign jargon, but I promise you will be satisfied.\n\nAs an out-of-state student, I know the financial pressures and concerns of those of you who pay the increased tuition and international fees. It is outrageous, and the bureaucracy needs to be addressed head on.\n\nIf elected, I will make sure there is a painless way to contact me regarding the issues YOU want addressed:\n\nDon't like a new fee? Let me know!\nWant to know what is happening in meetings? Feel free to ask!\nPissed off because our tuition is constantly increasing? ME TOO!\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Inspector General: This position would be created to audit the decisions of the Illinois Student Senate, and to give political transparency for all Illini. This is specifically in response to the fiasco over Campus Spirit Revival and their backdoor approach to legislation.\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Stenotype Operator: This position would entail recording all senate proceedings via written and/or oral transcripts. These records would then be available to all.\n\n\u2022 Weekly Massmail to all students: This would explain the highlights of the weekly session, as well as provide links to the transcripts of all proceedings for public benefit.\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Webmaster (Already exists. See update above): This position would entail keeping the ISS web portal up-to-date with all spending procedures and referendum announcements, as well as working with the ISS Stenotype Operator to make all sure all weekly proceedings are easily available to the student body.\n\nThere are an infinite number of questions and concerns the students of LAS have, and I assure you I will dedicate my time and energy to make sure your experience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is as stress free as possible. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, concerns, or proposals please post here; you may also send me an email, text, or tweet. I promise to reply back within 24 hours.\n\nEmail: deese2@illinois.edu\nTwitter: @bendeese\n\nWith that being said, I thank you for your interest!\n\nHere is a link to my Facebook page if you are interested or have friends that might be. If you like what you see, a share of my page can do wonders to reach the students of this fine school:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ben.deese.senate  A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  This was the letter I received from Robert Palinkas, Director of McKinley Health Center, regarding your question about condoms. I hope this helps:\n\n\"Ben Deese\n\nI write to you today as a response to an inquiry you submitted through McKinley\u2019s website.\nMcKinley has a long history of supporting access to birth control, reaching back several decades. Certainly McKinley\u2019s commitment to supporting birth control issues predates the recent Affordable Care Act, which has considerably opened up access to contraception for the American public in general.\nOver the years, McKinley Health Center has provided six to ten different versions of oral contraceptive for a small fee of just $5/month. This is in spite of the fact that McKinley purchases those medications for $15 to $20 per month supply through our wholesale provider.\nThe recent provisions of the Affordable Care Act now have moved University of Illinois students and virtually the entire American health insured public to completely free access to contraception. This is because insurance plans are now required to identify a list of no charge medications which must be supported by the licensed insurance underwriter.\nAs a result of those provisions, students at the University of Illinois can take their receipts for most of their contraceptive purchases to their insurance carrier and submit a claim for reimbursement. Assuming that the products are among those listed on the insurance carrier\u2019s free formulary, students could expect to be reimbursed for their acquisition, subject to the provisions of their individual insurance plan. One should remember that students have health insurance from many different sources, and the provisions of their plan will vary in accordance to regional laws governing insurance underwriting.\nMcKinley also offers a number of related no charge services to students at the University of Illinois in related areas. For example, individual sessions with our sexuality health educator are no charge, and McKinley provides regular limited access to no charge condoms to all students at the Health Resource Center at the Illini Union, McKinley Health Center, and at several of the cultural houses.\nFinally, McKinley Health Center has peer educators that are certified for the purpose of presenting sexual health related programs elsewhere on campus. Perhaps you might be interested in becoming involved in this project?\" I did read that whole answer, and honestly it seems like a lot of bs. My main problem is as follows: talking to friends at other big 10 schools and ISU and a few other universities I have come to the conclusion that EVERY university besides ours has no limit on condoms or else the limit is much higher than 12 per 2 weeks. Most universities also had clubs handing them out on their respective quad or else just had bowls full of them in the dorms. It just seems like mckinley is cheaping out is all. It's still better than no free ones at all, but thank you for doing the research and getting an answer for me! I can see you do care about this and care about the students and that is important. A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  I will write an email to McKinley today and ask what would be required to increase the distribution of free birth control to students. I will request permission to post the response to this thread. \n\nOn the point of GPA, I agree fully with that suggestion. In terms of pure math that would make sense, but the problem is that would allow above a 4.0 on the scale. Instead, removing an A- grade would make much more sense. If one can get above a 90% in a course, one deserves a 4.0. My mathematics professor, Aldo Manfroi, does this. It seems to work well.\n\nThing to note: This change would undoubtedly require sweeping change to the educational policy, something that requires Board of Trustees approval.  In past semesters when people in a similar situation as yours posted on reddit these are the 2 biggest things, and yet nothing seems to change. What can you do personally to follow through on these things? Also, A- being a 4.0 would also be acceptable, seems like a good compromise. I will bring it up at the ISS meetings, and if that doesn't work I will contact the university directly. Also, I have friends in Illini Media who could run stories to get the public involved. If thousands of students started mailing the chancellor and other board members, extreme pressure to act would be put on them. If a state or national news source found out, thousands of more voices could be added to the cause. The power if social media to make democratic participation easy will act as the key to change. \n\nI will also have a relatively light course load next year, so if elected, this position would be my primary focus.\n\nBasically, a \"No\" will not dissuade me from my goal, which is to make sure the opinions of the student body are brought to the table and then given an examination.  If this is a sincere answer then I truly respect that and hope for the best. As a senior graduating in May I would not personally benefit from this, but I hope future generations of students will.

If you like wonky details of GPA, here is one even within the same university:\n\n* At UIUC, an A- scores 3.67 in your GPA.\n* At UIS, an A- scores 3.70 in your GPA.\n\nAs someone who delves into student data sometimes, GPA is horrifying. :D This is atrocious. If you can provide me a link to the source \u2014 for verification \u2014 I will add it to the original post, as well as my Facebook page.  Please don't try to change it. It's really not worth trying to change. Some of your other ideas are really good and worth spending time on.\n\nAnyway! The best verification I have for you is the top result from a google search for **site:uis.edu gpa**, but it was a word document.\n\nAgain, please just file this away under \"universities are complicated\" rather than under \"universities have fixable problems.\" :) I understand that you may feel that way, but unless the idea of change is instigated, nothing will ever progress. To change GPA at the university is a daunting task. However, if the University of Illinois decided to re-evaluate its policies it could be the tipping point to others doing the same. \n\nOnce one brick falls the rest will tumble.  Hi Ben,\n\nAs a current senator I'm excited to hear about your desire to gt involved and make positive changes. I would suggest though that you spend some time learning more about ISS before going out and campaigning. Most of the things you are campaigning for already exist or are out of the purview of the ISS. I don't want to rain on the parade, but I wouldn't want you to make any promises to your constituents that you will not be able to fulfill.\n\nI'm more than happy to chat with you about ISS. Feel free to contact me.\n\nKevin Seymour\nGraduate Senator Kevin,\n\nI understand that many of these ideas are already reality. The thing is that the senate.illinois.edu portal is very confusing. Although videos exist, they are not up-to-date with current information.\n\nI understand that some things may be out of the purview of the ISS, but that means that they can be added to the constitution. Just because something cannot work today is not an excuse to prevent change for tomorrow. Ben,\n\nI agree that the ISS' website is very confusing (iss.illinois.edu is the one I think you are referring too? -- senate.illinois.edu is the domain for the UC Senate which every student senator is also a part of but mostly contains faculty). The ISS has recently hired a webmaster who is currently working to update the info and make it more user friendly, this should be coming out in the next week or so.\n\nSimply changing our constitution will not suddenly give the ISS new oversight over anything we so choose. The shared governance process is very complex, and I wont try to go into here.\n\nAgain, I'm more than happy to help you better understand this in more detail if you want to meet up at some point. I think its important that candidates are armed with knowledge about how ISS works. The reason so many people are upset with the ISS these days is because of misinformation.\n\nKevin  These are great suggestions to change university policy and I hope they work well; I'm sure many in ISS and even students that aren't have ideas of this nature. \n\nOn this note, I'd like to ask a few questions - as a senator, what actions will you have to take in order to complete these goals? How much agency do you have as an individual senator to change policy? Lastly, how much agency does the ISS have in creating university policy and acting as a check and/or balance for the administration?  What do you think of the $2 fee that ISS is hoping to tax its students with?   What is your take on the current budget of the ISS? Spending $3,786.42 for hand outs on quad day just to promote the ISS seems like a waste of funds. The same applies to the PSA. What is your take on this spending ? \n[budget](http://ge.tt/3yOtxnW/v/0?c)    If you want people to vote for you, give them candy. A Werther's Original stapled to a flier will do you wonders.  To address your second and third points:\n\n - The ISS already has a staff of interns who keep pretty decent minutes (which would be on the website if it was working). In the past, ISS kept video recordings of all it's meetings, but this stopped for reasons I'm unsure of. (Probably because no one ever asked to watch them.) I'd advise against hiring an actual stenographer, as they tend to be expensive and you'd need someone to translate all their notes anyway. Maybe a YouTube channel?\n - The University Administration limits the ISS to 3 (iirc) Massmails per year. The \"Administrative Agreement\" can be renegotiated, but it's a package deal. Once you start bargaining, everything ISS related goes on the table. On a related note, the current Vice-President Internal and Historian of ISS has been trying to set up an at-least-monthly newsletter to summarize passed and pending legislation. Might be worth sending him an email.\n\nI'd also like to point out that ISS has nothing to do with setting tuition.  You say you want to \"fight for YOUR rights as a student\" which personally I find refreshing since it seems that most ISS members just want material to throw on their resume.  \nSo on that note I'm curious about your opinion on the upcoming smoking ban.  There's no reason to take away the right of someone to smoke when a compromise of making designated smoking areas protects both smokers right to smoke and nonsmokers right to not.  \n\nAlso, how willing are you to compromise and when it comes to policy you disagree with?  Will you stick to your guns not matter what, or try to find a middle ground? The smoking ban is a touchy subject, but as an elected official I do have to be neutral and represent the student body. As a non-smoker this issue does not personally effect me, but I do have friends who smoke, and I have heard their anger over the ban.\n\nI agree with you and would attempt to propose an amendment to allow designated smoking areas, if that is what the students want. The city of Champaign-Urbana tends to have a lot of wind, which could be a potential problem for smoking areas, causing the smoke to drift to those who do not want it. However, the wind would also blow the smoke up and away, making sure that the smoking areas are relatively clean. \n\nYou are right that smoking areas work; as a California resident, I have been to Disneyland multiple times, and to cater to all customers, there must be smoking areas in the park. The Walt Disney Company has done an excellent job in allowing their smoking customers to be as welcome as the non-smoking ones. To create smoking areas would require a monetary investment, but if it could work, the rights of all students would be honored. With that being said, the issue is that in a democracy people will still be disappointed no matter what.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/17ulkk/i_am_running_for_iss_in_the_upcoming_election_so/", "id": 204, "title": "I am running for ISS in the upcoming election, so as to make our student government more transparent."}, {"snippet": "Sign up at: http://tinyurl.com/guitarpedal\n\nIEEE will be hosting a Guitar Pedal Workshop in 241/245 Everitt Lab at 2PM on February 17th, 2013!

While in school and jobless, you can start by making a monthly budget of food, rent, shopping, bills, etc. You can get a feel of how much you're spending and areas you can save money in (ie. fast food, shopping, beer).    Business major checking in. Going to whore myself out to Corporate America while still living like a college student. You shouldn't be spending more than $20,000 a year to live comfortably. As long as you make more than that (very easy,) and don't go on any big vacations (not so easy,) you should be able to put a lot of each paycheck into your debt. \n\nIt's all about living within your means. Hope this gives you some comfort. Dolla dolla bill, yall. Only problem is, \"You shouldn't be spending more than $20,000/year to live comfortably\" is a complete load of garbage.\n\nhttp://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2011/10/03/the-secret-to-living-well-on-20000-a-year\n\nYou give up quite a bit of creature comforts to live on $20k a year. No car, no health insurance, no retirement savings, going to the movies is considered a splurge. If you want to live \"comfortably\" in this town, which is significantly cheaper than a real city, you'll need more than that. I don't know about Seattle, but I can assure you that thousands of grad students live in this town on $20k or less (before taxes), while having both a car and a health insurance.  If they do not work over the summer at all, grad students average $17,183 per person. They live, but it'll assure you none of them will say it's a comfortable life.\n\nIt occurs to me that $20k is probably doable if you've got roommates. I suppose that would make a huge difference when compared to where my expenses go. I'm a grad student and I feel very comfortable on the 1.8k-ish I get per month.  Rent+utilities+food+monthly costs is maybe 800/mo tops (I have shopped around to keep this down), and this leaves me a ton for travel, climbing gear (big money sink), eating/going out, etc.  \n\nIf you aren't lazy, supporting someone, or really materialistic, I don't know how 20k isn't reasonable to live on. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low. Imagine being in Chicago or any other major city. You can't get by paying $350 rent. You are going to be paying at least $700 for rent and higher on everything else. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low.

Sorry, I think it was about 20k for 9 months or something like that.\nSure, I would rather have the extra 500/mo, but I hardly need it.  I'm able to travel for swing dancing or climbing nearly every week, and if I had to stay home one extra time a month, I would hardly be crushed.  I could probably manage to brew more often.

While in there, I was amazed at the abundant amount of electronic devices they have there at dirt cheap prices. For example, the guy in front of me in line bought an iPod cable for $1.30. I bought a 4 pack of AAA Energizer batteries for about $1.40. Comparatively, Walgreens, TIS, and other stores were charging about $7 for 4 AAAs.

Anything more than a quarter a battery is a rip off. But idk you must have seen them on sale when you were there. When I was there the generic brand was 4.99 and the Duracell were 6.99. Absurd.  more than a quarter a battery is a ripoff, and yet you paid $1.40 for 4, or 35 cents a battery?   Very true ECE store rocks!

We represent almost 2,400 teaching assistants and graduate assistants across the campus. You may have heard that we are on the edge of a work action, or strike. \n\nAs many of you already know, [the GEO has passed an authorization vote to go on strike](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/education/2012-11-16/geo-members-take-next-step-toward-strike.html). The state of Illinois requires that an authorization vote is taken before any strike can be declared, but in our organization, this vote does not mean we have declared a strike. Instead, based on our constitution, this vote creates a new committee with the executive power to declare, suspend, or call off a strike.\n\nFor those of you who already have a good grasp on the issues but want to know how to get involved, [signing our petition is a great start, even if you're not a member](http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-illinois-community-and-supporters-help-us-protect-tuition-waivers-for-teaching-assistants-and-graduate-assistants).\n\nThis is an AMAA, so please be warned that there are a few topics I cannot speak to:\n\n* The start date of a work action/strike\n* Buildings that would be targeted for picket lines\n* How long a potential strike could last\n* Whether your own graduate instructors will hold or cancel classes\n* **Rampart**\n\nI am being helped by a member who is a steward in our union who is using the username \"uiuc_grad.\" I don't know if he will be given any flair, but he is working with me to answer questions in a timely fashion. Because this is a new account, I will have to obey the 8 minute cool down in between posts for awhile.\n\nLooking forward to your questions!\n\n--Lindsay Anderson\n\n**Edit:** After conferring with my colleague who is helping me answer questions, it has come to my attention that my responses are very long-winded. I am hoping that you all will find the depth of my answers useful and that's what you came to this AMAA with the expectation of receiving.\n\n**Second edit:** It's 2 pm, and duty calls for me to attend a variety of meetings very soon for which I must prepare. Thanks all who submitted questions and visited! Thanks to those who helped answer questions, as well! Finally, thanks to the mods for letting me host this here! =) Hopefully if I get some time later, I will be able to come back and answer any questions that cropped up. In the mean time, please join the GEO at the Union from 9 am - 1 pm Monday and show your support! =]  Verified. This is, indeed, the co-president of our GEO. Thanks for verifying me! Annnd flair. They ended up being a little big so that they'd show up right.\n\nAfter the AMAA is over I'll set it so that anyone can select it as flair. For now, it can be a mark of official-ness.     &gt;**from Lsndr_Spnr**\n\n&gt;How will the actions of the GEO help keep down tuition costs of undergraduate students? Lack of flexibility with respect to tuition waivers seems to only encourage the administration to pass the costs of education from graduate students at the university onto undergraduates at the university. What is the GEO doing to insure that the administration doesn't continue to pass these costs onto tax payers and undergraduate students?\n\nThis is a very reasonable question. Interestingly enough, when the University provides tuition waivers to graduate students, it is not spending any money that it must recoup through tuition. In fact, no money trades hands. It isn\u2019t like one office at the University sends funds to another office. The amount of money the grad student would have paid is just \u201cwaived.\u201d Also, at the current rate of tuition for in-state undergraduate tuition, it takes some very small number of students (I think it\u2019s less than four students) to come up with most of our yearly wages. Let me say this another way: Based on the tuition paid by only four students, my entire year\u2019s salary is earned by the university.\n\nThink to your own courses that are taught by graduate students and think about how many students are in those sections and it is easy to see that the University takes in significantly more money than it is paying out to wages for graduate employees. Now, I can fully acknowledge that the total tuition collected by the University also needs to go toward paying professors, providing lab equipment, paying the Service Employees (solidarity, SEIU!) who make your dorm meals and clean building bathrooms, and of course pay the administration at the top levels. Additionally, the number of administrators has increased by almost 20% over the last five years. This is where tuition dollars are really going.\n\nIncoming tuition from undergrads pays for just less than a quarter of all the income the University receives. The money that is definitely coming in has magically not gone to help campus workers: Service Employees and GEO members have gotten just a smidge of an increase over the past few years, while some administrators have gotten up to 27% increases in their salaries (many of whom were already in the six figures). On average, your typical SEIU worker has been on a pay freeze for the past two years, GEO members have seen a small increase to our minimum wages \u2013 bringing us up to $14,820 -- which still does not bring us to the cost of living for this community, and the administrators have seen increases up to 27%.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t clear by now, what I am trying to say is that the GEO is not cornering the University into raising tuition for undergrads just so we can get paid more or make sure we have tuition waivers. Instead, what we see in the numbers is that when undergrad tuition goes up, *so do the salaries for administrators but not for anyone else*. When you speak of tuition flexibility, it really comes down to how the University is paying its top administrators instead of paying its other employees like grad employees and service workers. The GEO is drawing attention to the fact that the administration is paying itself loads while keeping wages low for other employees on campus, but it is only until students and parents start to make their dissatisfaction known to the Board of Trustees that anyone will be held accountable. The GEO cannot dictate where the funds come from to meet the financial aspects of our contract, but we are not interested in simply passing the buck to undergrads. We want higher education to be available to all sorts of people from all walks of life! However, we are also not afraid to point out to anyone who will listen that the funds are there to improve our wages and ensure our waivers, but the administration is acting like a sponge for those funds for everyone.\n\n**TL;DR:** The University definitely has the income to not raise tuition for undergrads and still meet contract requests by the GEO.  I decided to start answering questions that I received over the past day or so. Most of these questions had started to be addressed by uiuc_grad, but I wanted to provide some further context. Here are those responses:\n\n&gt;**from knpayne2** \n\n&gt;Why do you think the university is trying to eliminate tuition waivers if it makes our graduate programs much less competitive? Are they trying to eliminate tuition waivers across the board or just for specific programs?\n\nWe think that the University is moving into a corporate model of business (it is officially a non-profit institution) and is seeking to generate revenue. Right now, the tuition for undergraduates is hitting a type of saturation point where even in-state students might be hard-pressed to attend school here without financial aid and government assistance. An audit conducted every year by Howard Bunsis (accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University) shows that the undergrad tuition has jumped 151% in the last decade. University officials have been quoted by the News-Gazette saying that tuition is almost at a breaking point for undergrads. The lead counsel for the University told GEO bargaining team members in March that the University is now looking to turn to graduate students as a source of revenue.\n\nSo to connect the dots: The University wants to make more money to pay its highest administrators, so since it has been squeezing undergrads too hard, now it wants to squeeze grad students in the same way. Eliminating waivers and requiring students to pay would open the door for higher education to those who can afford it \u2013 a type of \u201cpay to play,\u201d if you will. \n\nWe believe that the University is starting to cater to specific departments because of how they generate money through research and patents, which means it doesn\u2019t care very much if certain humanities departments lose national prestige and fall by the wayside. Bear in mind that the Board of Trustees just announced at least six PhD programs will be cut soon.\n\nWe do not believe that the University is trying to shut down tuition waivers for every single graduate employee. However, we do know that the University wants the GEO to agree to contract language that prevents us from bargaining changes in tuition waivers for future students. This is ultimately what is scary for us \u2013 the University might charge students in one department some number and students in another department another number, and students in a third department would never pay a portion of their tuition. And the University wants the GEO to contractually agree to never have a say in how those individual departments may change their tuition policies.\n\n*Edit:* I originally responded to three or four questions in this post. I posted them as separate comments and removed those responses from this comment.  How much does graduate tuition actually cost? If the university charged as they do with undergraduates, what would be the comparative cost? [Here is a chart I found that describes the base rates for tuition for resident and non-resident graduate students](http://registrar.illinois.edu/financial/tuition_1213/AY/grad.html). There is obviously some fluctuation based on which college you belong to. [Here is a similar chart for undergraduate tuition rates](http://registrar.illinois.edu/financial/tuition_1213/AY/ugrad_base.html).\n\nTIL that the University charges basically the same rate for both of us. \n\nI am not clear what you are asking about regarding comparative cost. Feel free to rephrase and I'll make every effort to respond before the AMAA closes at 2 pm! =)  How does the compensation at UIUC compare to other Big 10 colleges?  &gt;**from roz77** \n\n&gt;I suppose my question is a bit more general. I was just wondering what the justification was for graduate students getting a tuition waiver and a stipend. I realize that TA's and RA's actually work for the university which is why they get paid, but they also take classes. Could someone provide me some numbers or something to show that grad students should be getting both types of financial assistance?\n\n&gt;I am certainly not against grad students receiving both tuition waivers and a stipend, I'm just wondering what the actual reasons are. The only reason I really ask is that a friend of mine who is also an alumni brought up this point. He and I are both in law school and are currently taking out loans to pay for it. Is that not an option for grad students? If this sounds combative, I promise I'm not trying to be. I'm just looking for some reasons behind the amount of financial assistance that grad students have available to them.\n\nThis is a very good question, and I am glad that someone asked it! The GEO\u2019s position is that as graduate employees, we teach a solid fifth of all course instruction on this campus. However, the University saves a *lot* of money by paying us very low wages (we don\u2019t receive stipends, we earn wages) instead of paying faculty to teach those classes. If the University had *no* graduate assistants to teach its courses, then it would have to hire professors to do all of that work for triple and quadruple the amount we are paid. We are *kind of* okay with the low wages (we would still like to earn the cost of living for this area and stop being able to apply for WIC and government aid) because we realize that we get substantial tuition waivers. Something to keep in mind is that we never see a dime of those tuition waivers, so even though we receive them, we don\u2019t actually \u201ccash in\u201d on them. However, we consider both waivers and wages as part of the compensation for the work we put into the University. \n\nUnlike other graduate students who receive no waivers (for example, students in the College of Law or College of Medicine), our labor props up this university. If you are interested in the specific numbers, [this website from the University shows that grad employees teach 20% of all classes and 36% of all 100-level courses]( http://www.dmi.illinois.edu/cp/). Without being able to offer competitive wages and waivers, the University will not be able to attract star graduate students. It is common sense that qualified graduate students will be courted from a variety of grad programs, and they will go where the money is, so to speak. It is the GEO\u2019s position that better qualified graduate employees results in better educated undergraduates. Therefore, continuing to offer compensation (in the form of livable wages and tuition waivers) is how you attract highly qualified graduate employees. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the money that goes into the tuition waivers is not money that changes hands, so it is not the case that the Administration is *spending* any money on graduate employees in that sense.  &gt;**from roz77** \n\n&gt;I suppose my question is a bit more general.

I found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/i7m9c/cheap_semiregular_travel_tofrom_chicago/) discussing options for heavy travel to and from Chicago. How viable is it to keep living in the Chicago area while taking classes on campus? On-campus housing doesn't seem to be very expensive, but it would be kind of nice to not have to move.\n\n2. What benefits/downsides are there to taking the M.C.S. program over the thesis-based M.S.? Given a choice I'd prefer to take the thesis program, since I heard that it makes it easier to apply for a Ph.D. (an option I'd like to leave open for the time being), but ultimately I'm not sure what the difference is.\n\n3. How easy is it to get around on campus? Living in the city I'm used to biking everywhere and, failing that, taking a train or bus.

If I move down to Champaign, would a bike be enough, or should I look into getting a car?\n\nAny information would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!   I also have few questions for you.\n1) Why do you want a Masters?\n2) How badly do you want it?\n\nHere are my answers to your questions\n\n1. This sounds like a bad idea to me\n\n2. I have a friend currently going through the MCS program and his primary reason for doing this is because he wants to keep on working (income) and also get a CS degree from a solid CS program. I'm not sure what the employers will think when you have a MCS compared to a MS degree, but I'm sure they will give you credit for it. Also MS degree will definitely make it easier to apply for a PhD - I think getting to know the professors in person and getting a recommendation is the biggest upside, even more so than having a paper published during your Masters.\n\n3. It is easy to get around campus even without a bike. But again I think commuting between Chicago and Champaign is a bad idea.\n\nIf you are lucky/good you can qualify for a RA or TA position.

I suppose my question is a bit more general. I was just wondering what the justification was for graduate students getting a tuition waiver and a stipend. I realize that TA's and RA's actually work for the university which is why they get paid, but they also take classes. Could someone provide me some numbers or something to show that grad students should be getting both types of financial assistance? \n\nI am certainly not against grad students receiving both tuition waivers and a stipend, I'm just wondering what the actual reasons are. The only reason I really ask is that a friend of mine who is also an alumni brought up this point. He and I are both in law school and are currently taking out loans to pay for it. Is that not an option for grad students? If this sounds combative, I promise I'm not trying to be. I'm just looking for some reasons behind the amount of financial assistance that grad students have available to them.   Firstly: could you please respond to the email that everyone received from the Illinois Provost on November 15? How can you justify using tuition waiver security as an excuse to strike when the email states: \n\n\"Contrary to a steady stream of communications from the GEO, degree seeking graduate assistants do not need to fear that their assistantship tuition waiver support will be reduced or eliminated. Providing tuition support through assistantships, scholarships and other financial assistance is the cornerstone for maintaining the excellence of our graduate programs.

I feel like that's an important detail.  He didn't just \"shoot at\" the dogs.  He killed one of them in front of a little girl.\n\nThis guy's judgement is clearly terrible.  He opened fire in a suburban area across the street from a high school to stop a dog fight.  [deleted] With the aim and decision making skills this officer demonstrated, the outcome could've been much worse.  He's lucky the girl didn't try to step in to save her dog.  He's lucky there weren't other kids nearby to catch a stray bullet.  Hell, he's lucky you didn't catch a stray bullet.\n\nUsing lethal force is a serious decision with serious consequences.  This officer cannot be trusted with that responsibility. [deleted]  While I think we can all agree this cop displayed very poor judgement, why was he dispatched to a dog fight? Does Champaign not have an animal control unit? If two dogs are fighting getting in the middle of it is dangerous, but animal control has the equipment to handle it.    What the fuck? What is with going straight for the gun? It's not like police officers are equipped with batons, tazers, or pepper spray. Geeze. Normally I'd be defending police in a situation like this, I think people are too critical of them.  But I think the issue here is he shot the family's dog (that did nothing but defend itself) instead of the pitbull with no owner that came out of nowhere and attacked it.\n\nedit:  are you saying you would attack a pitbull with a baton? He fired 8 shots(by the daughter's estimate), ONE hit the family dog, I think it's safe to say that one shot hit \"Dog\" by mistake.  \n\nI'm not defending the cop's bad decision, just read more carefully please What the fuck? What is with going straight for the gun? It's not like police officers are equipped with batons, tazers, or pepper spray. Geeze. I concur with the pepper spray idea...seems like a much better first option than the sidearm. Pepper spraying a dog won't make it stop, it'll make the situation much much worse. Now you'll have a dog who feels threatened by you. Even the most harmless pet can kill you if it feels like its life is in danger. I'll take my chances with a pepper-sprayed pet over it being shot. B/c the life of a dog is more valuable then the safety of your own body? \n While it's true people have noted that my actions have a tendency towards recklessness, in this case I am trying to state that if it were my dog in that situation, I would want pepper spray tried before shots being fired.  If it doesn't work, and there's no other option, then shoot.  But yes, I am willing to risk personal harm to save the life of my dog.  If that's irrational, so be it.  I say this having the experience of being attacked by two large, feral dogs at once in the middle of nowhere, and I managed to fend them off suffering a bite on my arm, bruises and scratches.  Had to get rabies shots and everything. I believe you and honestly if it was my dog, I'd completely agree. But it wouldn't be us in danger. It would be the officer. Police (espcially UIPD) are underpaid and underappreciated for all the work they do. A fair point - one I concede.   I believe you and honestly if it was my dog, I'd completely agree.

If you really have been attacked by two large feral dogs, and are condemning a police officer from protecting himself AND others in a situation almost identical. \n\nSeriously?\n I conceded the use of lethal force over pepper spray from the officer's point of view.  But that's not what I would do if it were my pet involved.  That's a risk I would definitely take.  So either I'm confident in my abilities to handle variations on situations which have previously been able to manage, or I'm a little nuts.  Take your pick, I don't really care which you go with. I'm very impressed with how rational this conversation has remain.  Part of the reason I think I feel so differently than you as I am sick of the human concept of valuing the life of a pet/animal over the life of another human being. \n\nDuring a presentation on the black death I was explaining how nearly a third of the earths population died, my classmates continued to listen to my speech.

So a cop should not shoot a criminal that has a gun pointed at him until he is shot?  I'd say until he's been shot at, but there's a difference between \"a criminal\" and \"a dog\".  I'm got-damn tired of cops who are so afraid of being bitten by dogs that they blast away the instant they see one moving toward them.  Family pets who are curious about the new guy in the yard don't merit being shot, and a cop who is so fearful of his own safety around dogs that he opts to shoot first shouldn't be a cop -- because sooner or later, he'll do it to a person. &gt; family pet\n\nUnrestrained pit bull attacking a girl's dog   Let it go maybe the cop was a bad shot, maybe he meant to hit the pitbull but missed no one knows but the cop.

Football wise yes. But just imagine from a basketball perspective. Literally the only \"tough\" teams would be Michigan and Michigan State. I dont know how this would work with 14 teams, but right now, we don't use divisions for basketball. We play 7 teams twice each year and the other 4 once for a total of 18 league games.

Maybe have each division play a tournament, and the champs play each other for the Big Ten title. As you mention, there are no divisions for basketball now and there probably won't be in the near future. The Big East currently has 16 men's basketball teams and they do not have divisions. The Big East tournament uses a combination of a two-round bye and one-round bye.\n\n*Edit: Adding, the B1G could easily seed 3-14 with 1 &amp; 2 getting a one round bye.

I'm not saying one side is right and the other is wrong, but this is my analysis of the situation.  There are several inaccuracies in your observations.  Although it is correct that this university does have three separate classifications, they are largely identical in payscale and all equally covered by the GEO's contract (pay being set at an hours per week worked rate).  Additionally, all graduate students working for the university receive their tuition waivers from the graduate college.  The \"funding\" you're talking about is only in terms of the source of their stipends (and even then, not all RAs are grant funded).  The GA classification is for those holding positions not involving research or teaching, but that does not mean they are unimportant.  Many GAs in my department hold administrative positions that will prepare them for appointments later in their careers even though they do not fit within the terms defining TA and RA appointments.\n\nBut most importantly, this contention is NOT solely about GA positions.  As several have pointed out, the News Gazette is not using \"graduate assistant\" in a nuanced fashion in that one particular sentence.  They're using it as a blanket term to cover all graduate employees holding assistantships.  The GEO wants contract language to protect waiver reduction or withdrawal for all graduate employees. After looking through the sources, I agree that this involves both TA's and GA's. It seems that the university either cannot afford to, or does not want to maintain a competitive program in the fine and applied arts. It is regrettable, but without funding, what can you do?\n\nAs for RA's, it is true that they receive tuition waivers from the graduate college, but when a PI receives funding for a graduate research assistant, 60%+ of that goes to the university as \"overhead\" , which is intended to cover tuition, among other things. The rest goes into lab equipment and the actual stipend for the RA.

However, [this petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-illinois-community-and-supporters-help-us-protect-tuition-waivers-for-teaching-assistants-and-graduate-assistants) indicates that the administration is seeking to reduce tuition waivers for TA's as well.\n\nI don't really understand who GA's are: these are graduate students not teaching, and not supported by research?

I'd be interested in seeing an official source from the university seeking to reduce tuition waivers for TA's. Everything that I've read so far only mentions GA's.  I'll probably get downvoted to hell again, but so be it.  The last plan I was aware of involved calling the strike on the first day back from Thanksgiving break.  This is the time of the semester when it is essential to have class un-disrupted.  Calling the strike at this time will not put much additional pressure on the administration as a strike at some other time would; what it *will* do is wreak havoc among undergrads who are trying to get ready for finals.  The GEO is using undergrads as pawns in their battle against the administration, and that is downright despicable.  Striking during syllabus week in January will cause just as many headaches for the university, and virtually none for other students. [deleted] The university is broke; the state hasn't fulfilled its funding obligations since before I was a freshman in 2005.  The fact that lots of TAs want more money and tuition wavers won't magically make the money appear in the budget.....today's announcement from Hostess makes that abundantly clear.

You understand that is a lie right?  The money from the state is down but the numbers show the university is not \"strapped for cash\". I am making this comment now so I will come back and edit it with a link.\n\nFurthermore, the GEO's points are that if the University is in such \"dire\" needs why do they continue to pump money into overhead administrative costs that feed the salaries of those involved in scandals.  The amount of money the University has pumped into the legal battle over contracts is absurd at this point.  Undergrads should be appalled that their money is being used like this.

[deleted] So you think that all strikes are despicable?  Walmart employees are hired to work at walmart, and they time their strikes to maximize the disruption for their own benefit.  And the reason they do so is that this is the only way they can force their employer to bargain.  I see no difference with the graduate students. [deleted] I am with you man.  Being a TA is a privilege and not a right.  If the person doesn't hold a role of an educator they shouldn't be allowed the benefits.   Your logic is basically saying it's a privlege to have a job.  It comes down to the fact that the University needs TAs/RAs/GAs and ya they can replace them with shit but then their whole Research 1 status will go away pretty quickly when the caliber of student accepted by the various departments drops drastically.\n\nThe word is already spreading and when possible-future graduate students in various fields here that their tuition-waiver can be in jeopardy every 3 years, they don't want to come here. I am with you man.  Being a TA is a privilege and not a right.  If the person doesn't hold a role of an educator they shouldn't be allowed the benefits.   &gt; If the person doesn't hold a role of an educator they shouldn't be allowed the benefits. \n\nTA's do hold the role of educator and are trying to keep the benefits from being reduced. I have been a TA for several classes and portions of my pay do go right to the GEO. My department pays well enough for myself to live within my means.  I still hold firm that the job is a gift and not a right.  True a lot of profs would collapse if they had to grade or teach all of their students.  But to see the GEO banging and chanting on drums like in 2010 was just embarrassing.  If someone doesn't want to work.. there are lines of people who would gladly take their position. \n\nAlso the claws that \"Payment to support family\"  the departments do not pay \"your\" family to work.  The choice to marry and have kids in your 20's is not the concerns of the University.   &gt; I still hold firm that the job is a gift and not a right.\n\nAs long as the terms are mutually beneficial, then I can agree with that. UIUC gets to pay a TA much less than a professor to teach a class, while the TA also receives some of the benefits (not all) that a professor receives.\n\nI haven't heard the \"payment to support family\" claim. Can you clarify? This time of the year is when TA's have maximum leverage over the university.  A strike at that time will anger the university's paying customers (students and their parents) and thereby imperil the university's revenues.

Of course the unions are trying to get the undergrads involved, since only the undergrads (or their parents) have any leverage over the administration. The TA's striking the week after we get back will do nothing but solidify animosity between me and a \"teaching assistant union\" Yeah, and I'm sure they couldn't care less if you hate them, as long as you pressure the administration to end the strike.  Your previous non-animosity did nothing to help them.  GEO handled the vote in a really shady way. They only allowed online voting for five hours each day over 3 days. I'd be surprised if very many members voted on the strike outside of the GAs with a vested interest. For the record, voter turnout among GEO members was over 50%. The claim that the way the vote was run was deliberately meant to discourage voting is downright ridiculous. Regardless of the motivations, the voting process left much to be desired.\n\nThere was little notification of the upcoming vote, voting itself was limited to a narrow time window, and the raw results were not published.\n\nRefusal to supply the news gazette with the actual vote count is completely unacceptable.

Pointed words on an anonymous forum are easy. What do you think needs changing in 385? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Fair enough.\n\nDisclaimer: My lab partner was the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen. Super senior complete stoner that cheated his way through undergrad. He had already taken part of the course and then dropped, saving it for his second to last semester. Still managed to be useless. Not a single piece of work delegated to him was done correctly. I did the final project singlehandedly. IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON TAKING ECE 385, HAVE A COMPETENT PARTNER CHOSEN AHEAD OF TIME.\n\nit's worth 2 credit hours. That in of itself is some kind of sick joke. I wouldn't have minded a few homework assignments throughout the semester to justify the extra credit hours. But in reality the extra hours are already justified.\n\nIf you have a bad lab partner you're completely fucked. More so than other lab courses in my experience.\n\nLecture was particularly useless in 385. I went most of the time, but I don't think I ever learned anything from lecture that the lecture slides wouldn't have told me. \n\nNot having access to the lab at all hours or a lab with all of the necessary materials. The keyboard lab in particular was bad for this. Lock up the expensive stuff, and give people swipe access  to the room :\\\n\n\"Difficulty points\" on the final project were pretty arbitrary. I did a mini-jack to VGA audio visualizer (with 2 modes) and got a 6 just like the group next to me that did the suggested, COMPLETELY ORIGINAL \"snake game\" with no extra functionality\n\nTo my knowledge the lab assignments have been identical for a few years. It's no wonder cheating is rampant in 385\n\n\"Here's how you're gonna learn VHDL: we're gonna shove you off a bridge and hope you don't die. After the drop date\" ***this one in particular bugged me. Sure, VHDL isn't that hard once you get the hang of it, but they just drop it on you with no guidance. Online documentation for VHDL is way worse than it is for non hardware descriptor languages, (Python, C, Java, etc.) so I think more guidance on that front would have made a huge difference. Also, Quartus was super buggy for me. Granted, ModelSim in 411 has been even worse in that you can't even get your own copy.\n\nI think the breadboard segment of the course is far too long in comparison to the FPGA segment. After 4 or so breadboard labs, I'm pretty sure any ECE that actually did the labs would be competent enough at laying down wires and TTL chips to do it in a situation where it is necessary.\n\n\n\n\nDid I learn a lot from 385? Yeah, but the course is inconvenient for the sake of being inconvenient and outdated. I'm just going to respond to a few sections of this.\n\nFirst off the lab partner, eh... that's not so much the course's fault so much as your own bad luck. A bad lab partner is what it is, you can always try changing and eventually it sucks, but doing it on your own.\n\nThis may or may not add to your argument but I was in a meeting with the admin about courses once and the reason 385 is only two hours is because if it were 4 (about what it should be) it would hurt too many people's GPAs. It's most people's first intense lab and they don't want to hurt anyone too badly.\n\nLectures, yeah, kind of useless. \n\nFor the lab, you could have always joined IEEE for help with the first labs with breadboards. They have the test boxes, very useful. That lab is used for so many other classes that they can't give access to everyone. \n\nI'm not sure about all the trouble you had with VHDL, the copy/paste lab has enough documentation that you can refer to it for 90% of your problems and if not ask your TA/google for it. My Senior Design Project was entirely based on VHDL and the only knowledge I had was 385. \n\nYes it has it's issues, I'm not sure how to fix it. But as you concluded with, the course ultimately accomplished its goal to teach you a lot.  If you want to improve it make sure you fill out your evaluations in detail, the TAs/teaches really do read those in detail. Yeah, it's hard, it's tough, but even a bad grade in the class will teach you more than an easy lab. \n\nEdit: I just want to say that no matter how hard ECE Illinois is, all these classes which seem hard for no reason, you're going to come out of the program HIGHLY desirable. So long as you graduate with an ECE degree, you are set for life and will be able to find a job. Depending on GPA and such it may be harder/easier, but it's not a matter of if you get a job, but what job you get. ECE 385, 411, 391, 445, plenty of times you have no idea why they're so hard, and they could be better  in plenty of ways, but by getting through them you've proven yourself. Just saying I'm from ECE Illinois is enough of a resume to plenty of people. I don't mean to argue your points, they are all perfectly valid in my eyes, and it's nice to see alternative viewpoints on 385. Just some thoughts:\n\n\nIf 385 were 4 instead of 2 credits, people would probably take one less class that semester and thus do better in the course. Maybe. Alternatively, splitting the course into 2 semesters of 2 credits with extra material tacked on at the end would be helpful too. \n\n\nThere's no way the ECE department doesn't have the resources to allocate a lab room just for one of its most important and grueling courses that is the first with a heavy lab component.\n\n\nI agree with the part about being desirable. My GPA is garbage, my non-academic resume is mediocre, and somehow I'm still managing to score interviews with great companies. Really excited for some upcoming on-site interviews on the west coast :)\n\nKeep your chins up underclassmen. It gets better when you've got money for all the video games, junk food, and alcohol your little heart could desire. (How I felt during my internship this summer) Be active and I guarantee you can find a job or internship (if you're a junior. no guarantees for sophomores and freshmen unfortunately. More of your classmates have yet to be weeded out!)\n\n\nECE 391 was the turning point in my college career. STEVE LUMETTA for prez 2016\n\n\nedit: really hoping the new ECE building has some really nice labs for 385, 391, and 411. with beds. and coffee machines. and ergonomic keyboards. DAT CARPAL TUNNEL. I'm guessing that they expect underclassmen to have heard the horror stories of 385 work and account accordingly. Plus everyone is supposed to have their advisers sign off on their schedule, in theory there are enough checks in place to make sure no one overloads. For that actually being the case... not as much as it should be. I wish it had been 4 hours, actually would have helped my GPA...\n\nYou'd be surprised about the lab space. The department really doesn't have the space to have a 385 only lab, lack of lab space is a major reason we're getting a new building. I don't think 385 is getting a dedicated lab, but there will be the open lab which everyone will have access to to work on 385. I haven't looked at the blueprints in a while.\n\nYeah, I got interviews with companies I was more than a tad shocked by (but very happy for) with my GPA. Good luck on your west coast interviews! My actual motivation to continue in ECE was realizing it was a source of unlimited karma on this subreddit.\n\nThanks for the good luck wishes dude. i think it's worth noting that if you are a CompE going for a software job - ECE screws you over big with classes like 385. The reasons are two fold:\n\n(1) You are directly competing with CS students, who don't really have classes like 385 or 391 - while the CompE is slaving away  for a B, the CS major is breezing through CS 232. Not only will they have a higher GPA - they will have more time to apply for jobs and beef up their resumes with extra-projects.\n\nGranted, it's my fault for not choosing CS - but the reason I bring this up is because I heard an engineering tour guide answer \"What's the difference between CompE and CS\" and not mention how much harder you will be working as a CompE and more importantly that CompE != Software Engineering\n\n...sorry for rambling ! (not really) I don't mean to argue your points, they are all perfectly valid in my eyes, and it's nice to see alternative viewpoints on 385.

Not to sidetrack this but it is 2 days old so I feel like I can.\n\nWhat are some tips you can give for getting all those interviews?  I wasn't in ECE (I was in Math/CS) but my GPA was fine, my experience list was crap, yes, but I could never get far in any interview process at all and only worked one summer.  I blame it at first on me liking theoretical CS rather than software engineering, along with just being too scared to talk because I knew I had no experience and didn't know what I was looking for.\n\nNow I'm in graduate school in California, feeling poor as hell, seeing my classmates live \"the life\" so to speak, and I feel like I'm kind of stuck because I'm not in undergraduate school anymore, and if I (for whatever reason) had to drop out of this school, I keep thinking I'd have a very hard time getting hired.  But reading what you wrote, it seems like it would definitely still be possible. You need to understand that most of the other people getting jobs out of college don't have experience either. \"Knowing you have no experience\" is a terrible mindset with which to approach your job search. CS isn't one of those stereotypical fields where you \"need experience to get experience.\" Attend hackathons. Contribute to open source projects. Have a pet project. Any of those things count as experience for someone studying CS.\n\n\n Be aggressive about pursuing any job that seems remotely interesting to you. Go on Symplicity (or equivalent for the school you're currently attending) and send 20 resumes out in 30 minutes. Follow up with recruiters and interviewers when possible. \n\n\nDuring your interviews, you need to realize that for technical questions the interviewer is not necessarily looking for just the right answer (especially seemingly impossible problems that Google might throw at you). He's looking to see how you approach a difficult problem. Do you ask him questions to clarify what he's looking for? Do you clearly state assumptions and check for errors? All of these factors are not necessarily part of the answer itself, but can weigh positively or negatively on you.\n\n\nNot knowing what you're looking for is kind of a problem, but not necessarily a death knell. When an interviewer asks you what you're interested in, realize that they're not saying \"what would you like to lock yourself into doing for the rest of your life?\" People pivot in their careers all the time, and how you answer that question does not obligate you to stay in that field forever. However, you can't just act all surprised when they ask that question and give a shitty answer. Talk about projects, schoolwork, and courses that you found most interesting, and why. \n\n\nIf your interests are in theoretical CS, I think you made the right move going to grad school. Things should be easier as far as getting job now that you're in grad school. Meanwhile, don't worry about how your classmates are living \"the life.\" Money isn't everything, and some have called grad school \"the sweet spot in life.\" \n\n\nFinally, realize that CS at UIUC puts you at a distinct advantage over 99.9% of the other graduates out there. Be confident during your interviews, and good luck man. After all, luck is another huge factor in the hiring process. Fair enough.\n\nDisclaimer: My lab partner was the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen. Super senior complete stoner that cheated his way through undergrad. He had already taken part of the course and then dropped, saving it for his second to last semester. Still managed to be useless. Not a single piece of work delegated to him was done correctly. I did the final project singlehandedly. IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON TAKING ECE 385, HAVE A COMPETENT PARTNER CHOSEN AHEAD OF TIME.\n\nit's worth 2 credit hours. That in of itself is some kind of sick joke. I wouldn't have minded a few homework assignments throughout the semester to justify the extra credit hours. But in reality the extra hours are already justified.\n\nIf you have a bad lab partner you're completely fucked. More so than other lab courses in my experience.\n\nLecture was particularly useless in 385. I went most of the time, but I don't think I ever learned anything from lecture that the lecture slides wouldn't have told me. \n\nNot having access to the lab at all hours or a lab with all of the necessary materials. The keyboard lab in particular was bad for this. Lock up the expensive stuff, and give people swipe access  to the room :\\\n\n\"Difficulty points\" on the final project were pretty arbitrary. I did a mini-jack to VGA audio visualizer (with 2 modes) and got a 6 just like the group next to me that did the suggested, COMPLETELY ORIGINAL \"snake game\" with no extra functionality\n\nTo my knowledge the lab assignments have been identical for a few years. It's no wonder cheating is rampant in 385\n\n\"Here's how you're gonna learn VHDL: we're gonna shove you off a bridge and hope you don't die. After the drop date\" ***this one in particular bugged me. Sure, VHDL isn't that hard once you get the hang of it, but they just drop it on you with no guidance. Online documentation for VHDL is way worse than it is for non hardware descriptor languages, (Python, C, Java, etc.) so I think more guidance on that front would have made a huge difference. Also, Quartus was super buggy for me. Granted, ModelSim in 411 has been even worse in that you can't even get your own copy.\n\nI think the breadboard segment of the course is far too long in comparison to the FPGA segment. After 4 or so breadboard labs, I'm pretty sure any ECE that actually did the labs would be competent enough at laying down wires and TTL chips to do it in a situation where it is necessary.\n\n\n\n\nDid I learn a lot from 385? Yeah, but the course is inconvenient for the sake of being inconvenient and outdated. I know this may fall on dead ears, but here goes anyway.\n\nIt sucks to have bad lab partners, but in the end, you end up getting what you pay your tuition money for, skills/knowledge. The fact that the partner gets the same credit (most of the time) doesn't help from feeling as though you are being robbed, but it is quite the opposite. The amount of work that you had to do in order to get that grade, that work that your partner didn't do, it's not something extra that went nowhere, it went into your knowledge bank, not his/hers.\n\nAll my college career and even in my early grad career, I've had to deal with countless number of incompetent lab mates for one reason or the other, whether they were actual idiots or they just didn't have time (senior grad). Either way, I did the work, came out on top, and when I talk about the things I learned from those lab experiences, I am confident that I know what I'm talking about.\n\nThis trend seems to exist in other disciplines as well. My brother, who has a degree in Architecture, constantly complained how incompetent his studio partner was and he had to redo everything he did (or just do what he didn't do). That partner went nowhere with his degree after barely graduating, while my brother got in top grad programs.\n\nI've been there and I know how emotional you can get when slapped with such blatant injustice, but in the end, that really doesn't leave any lasting effect. What does have lasting impact, however, is the work that you do and the hours that you put into that measly two credits. Pointed words on an anonymous forum are easy. What do you think needs changing in 385? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Pointed words on an anonymous forum are easy. What do you think needs changing in 385? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I just got a massemail from the provost explaining how GEO's wording of the situation is misleading, and that they never even suggested cutting tuition waivers for TAs/RAs/GAs in the first place.\n\nDid they actually suggest that and retracted once the issue got some publicity? Or is this a conspiracy? If you wouldn't mind:  please read the open letter from the GEO in regards to the Provost's email.  Please note that their reply is intercalated.\n\n\nDear GEO members,\n\nYou likely received an email today from the Administration distorting and outright denying the claims we have made as a union. First, this type of correspondence from the Administration is not uncommon during this point of contract negotiations. Indeed, similar emails went out in the days leading up to and during the Strike of 2009. It means that our organizing efforts have caught their attention, and that is due to the hard work and dedication of our members.\n\nHowever, we would like to respond to the following assertions (listed below in quotes):\n\n1) \"Contrary to a steady stream of communications from the GEO, degree seeking graduate assistants do not need to fear that their assistantship tuition waiver support will be reduced or eliminated.\"\n\n\u00b7 The administration\u2019s actions do not support this claim. In November 2009, approximately 1,000 GEO members went on strike and successfully won tuition waiver protection in their contract.\n\n\u00b7 During 2010-2011 academic year the University administration began to charge hundreds of dollars of tuition each semester for incoming graduate employees in the College of Fine and Applied Arts, in direct violation of our contract.\n\n\u00b7 The GEO filed a grievance on this contract violation. In September 2011, a neutral arbitrator ruled in favor of the GEO. The administration continued to fight to be able to reduce these waivers. Just today the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board found unanimously in favor (5-0) of the GEO supporting our tuition waiver contract language.\n\n\u00b7 This means this Administration has already spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees trying to change tuition waivers.\n\n\u00b7 A representative of this Administration has told officials of the GEO in a meeting held on March 2, 2012 that they actually see graduate tuition waivers as a means to \u201cgenerate revenue.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 The Administration has continually refused to keep language in our contract that would protect tuition waivers for all of our members.\n\nIt is only logical to conclude that the administration sees graduate student tuition waivers as a source of revenue and is even willing to stand in violation of legally upheld contract language to make money on the backs of some of our lowest-paid members.\n\n2) \"The GEO's second recurring theme is that the University pay proposals are unfair and do not provide assistants with a livable wage. Such accusations are inaccurate. Under the GEO contract that just expired, teaching and graduate assistants are guaranteed a minimum annual rate which translates to an approximate hourly rate of $19.00 per hour. The average rate on campus is $22.03 per hour (or $17,183 per year for an assistant with a 50 percent 9 month appointment). Over the three years of the GEO contract that just expired, the minimum stipend level was increased by 10 percent. The University has presented wage proposals that would guarantee that continuing assistants would receive salary increases consistent with those given to other employees under the campus salary program.\"\n\n\u00b7 This false and misleading. During bargaining, this Administration continually offers the majority of GEO members \u201cthe campus wage program.\u201d The campus wage program means that the administration sets wages at their sole discretion, and provides no guarantee that anyone will receive any wage increase. It would be the equivalent of the GEO giving up the right to bargain salary if we agree to this misleading tactic. Both sides must bargain the entire salary and benefits package for each year the contract is in effect.\n\n\u00b7 The $17,183 average cited by this Administration includes members who make far above the minimum wage as well as those who are paid at the lowest scale. Approximately a third of our bargaining unit makes the minimum wage for Teaching and Graduate Assistants, $14,820. The GEO has proposed bringing that minimum up to what this Administration itself calculates as the living wage for Urbana-Champaign (which for 2012-2013 is $16,926), and to date this Administration has not agreed to that proposal.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to work with the administration at obtaining a fair and living wage; we sincerely hope they plan to meet us in this effort as much as they have just claimed.\n\n3) \"Despite the strike authorization vote taken by the GEO, we want you to know that a strike is neither inevitable nor necessary. The issues of tuition waivers and pay can be resolved through negotiation and mediation, as they have been in the past. We urge you to become familiar with the facts and make decisions based on all of the relevant information related to the negotiations process.\"\n\n\u00b7 We wholeheartedly and emphatically agree with the Administration's statement that \"the issues of tuition waivers and pay can be resolved through negotiations and mediation, as they have been in the past.\"\n\n\u00b7 However, the GEO has met with the Administration more than 20 times since last April. The GEO has been working without a contract since mid-August. Two sessions with a federal mediator have not garnered agreement on health care, tuition waivers or wages. We didn\u2019t receive a proposal of any kind on tuition waivers until just yesterday. That proposal includes flawed language that places many graduate employees at risk. We still believe there is no need to change the current language, which assures all members tuition waiver protection.\n\n\u00b7 We also \u201curge you to become familiar with the facts and make decisions based on all of the relevant information related to the negotiations process.\u201d The GEO actively encourages all members to attend bargaining sessions. Dozens of members have sat through these sessions and have formed their own opinions based on this process.\n\nThe next two bargaining sessions are: November 26, 1 p.m. and 27, 8:30 a.m. at the Levis Faculty Center. We encourage all GEO members to join us at these sessions.\n\nThe GEO proposals are reasonable. The top 28 administrators on campus received an average 5.86 percent wage increase this year. That's over 5 percent added on to their six figure salaries. Compare that to the administration's best offer to date, which leaves hundreds of TAs below the standard of a living wage. Under the current GEO wage proposal, total salaries for members would account for only 2 percent of the yearly campus budget. To put this in perspective, we teach 20 percent of all classes on campus.\n\nFinally, the GEO has strong support on campus and beyond, that is growing every day. A petition on our behalf to the Board of Trustees has received more than 1,200 signatures in just 2 days. If you would like to add your name to the petition and send a message to the Illinois Board of Trustees, please follow this link to the petition: Solidarity Petition.\n\nSolidarity,\n\nThe GEO\n Thank you.

I'd like to hear the background story on this whole issue. I just got a massemail from the provost explaining how GEO's wording of the situation is misleading, and that they never even suggested cutting tuition waivers for TAs/RAs/GAs in the first place.\n\nDid they actually suggest that and retracted once the issue got some publicity?

Great info. Thanks.  Could a research university even survive without providing graduate students with waivers?

This would scare the hell out of me if I thought they'd be anything like 211 or 212, but it seems like there's not as many labs/all that SmartPhysics bullshit. I actually enjoy having material presented and learning it on my own for the most part.\n\nIs it even worth it? Would a physics minor on a resume help me get a job any more than if I didn't have it? Anyone with a physics/other applicable minor have any input on this?  I'm a EE and have looked into getting a CS, physics, math, or Matse minor. After talking to various advisors and people in industry, I think I can confidently say that minors don't really matter at all. I would encourage you to take classes you find interesting, rather than trying to find classes that fit x requirement or y credits. When it eventually comes to applying to jobs, your \"minor\" will just be a very small bullet point on the entire page- below the far more important \"major.\" \n\nRather than highlighting the \"minor\" part, I would encourage you to think about how to present individual coursework you did; whether that amounts to course projects or theory you found interesting. Besides, given how lax quite a few of the requirements for minors are, I doubt you'll gain much knowledge or insight from a full fledged minor over just taking a few classes here and there. \n\nI guess my point is that if you need like 1 or 2 more classes for one or you're really excited about a particular field of study and find the required courses interesting, go for it. Otherwise, minors don't mean shit.     I have no idea if it would be useful, but as a physics major I can give some insight on how difficult it would be.\n\nThe first class you'd take after the 21X sequence is PHYS 255.  It's usually taught by Naomi Makins, who is a fantastic teacher, and it will give you a much better idea of how upper-lever courses are taught -- heavy reliance on homework, test averages that extend occasionally into the low 50's, emphasis on really understanding the material to the point where you can apply it.\n\nThe rest of the classes you'd take are probably 325, 435, and 486 (classical mechanics I, electrodynamics I, and quantum I respectively).  These courses cover the same material as 211, 212, and 214, but in much greater depth.  Instead of applying F=ma, you'll take F = dp/dt; you'll rederive all the equations from 212 using vector calculus (not as bad as it sounds) and actually USE maxwell's equations; Schrodinger's equation in QM is now a differential equation you solve for (albeit simple) potentials.\n\nYou can probably tell, I love my major.  It's not easy, but damn it's satisfying.  We have by and large good teachers for the upper level classes, and honestly if you apply yourself you will excel. Agree with everything you said, but it's 225, not 255   you have to take 325 to get a minor right (assuming the nomenclature hasn't changed- its the mechanics/relativity class with calculus)? I would take this, and see if you want to keep going. Compared to the 200's, its pretty brutal. you have to take 325 to get a minor right (assuming the nomenclature hasn't changed- its the mechanics/relativity class with calculus)? I would take this, and see if you want to keep going. Compared to the 200's, its pretty brutal. It's also more or less the weed-out course in the Physics department. Things may have changed in the ~5 years since I went through that sequence, but 325/6 were the two hardest courses I took in the physics department. So I would say take that, and if you are still interested, keep going, but just do it because it's fun---no one will care about what minors you do or don't have when you're applying for jobs/grad schools.   I'm not sure whether it's worth it, but PHYS 325 definitely isn't a weed out class. ECE 190 is a weed out class, this is a walk in the park compared to that. It just requires you actually use diffy Q, which you should be able to handle doing if you invest yourself in this. \n\nThe first week of homework is hard, but then you adjust and you know what questions you want to ask and can figure it out from there. The only thing this class requires to do well is a little time management. The homework doesn't take me more than three hours, and Gollin is available all the time to help you. You have plenty of time to complete his tests which are structured to be significantly easier than the homework. He doesn't give you a problem you haven't seen before AND his problems are funny. \n\nIt's an enjoyable class, and with respect to a lot of other classes, it's not hard at all. His last test average was a 78, curved only in the sense that he wrote one problem which was difficult and only a handful of people got (I ended up getting everything right except that problem, and I'm no genius by any means), so he accounted for that. Don't let people deter you from taking the class. I'm not sure how the other professor is, but I'd suggest taking it with Gollin because he makes class fun. Weaver's not bad, but from what I've heard Gollin's 325 is almost as good as Naomi's 225. Take it with him if you can.   [deleted] Holy hell.

The only part that got cut out was \"Dear Building Occupant,\".\n\nNow why do you get pissed off at them asking for raises (regardless if it's 1.7% or something else) instead of the administrators taking bonuses 3x the amount that the 800 workers want? I never said I wasn't upset about the admins getting overpaid. But the fact that they are misleading and intentionally trying to garner sympathy in places where sympathy might not be due doesn't seem right to me.\n\nMaybe this one hasn't had things cut out, but then there was another one being handed out that had more information. I know, I got it and read it. Tangent to what you're saying, but: The admins aren't nearly as overpaid as you might think. Compare [these numbers](http://data.illinimedia.com/salaries/index) to private industry numbers for people with similar degrees and experience - you'll notice that they almost always take a cut by working at the University. For good reason probably, it's probably a much better environment to work in with far more job security. That kind of shit doesn't show up on a paycheck but are pretty invaluable.\n\nDo the figures you posted include the awesome benefits and retirement packages university employees get? Factor those in and they may not be under the private sector anymore.\n\nFurthermore, you say it's less than the private sector without offering figures. \n\nIf you wander into source territory you better be thorough. Once you stop wildly speculating and start being empirical the bar raises pretty quick. The only part that got cut out was \"Dear Building Occupant,\".\n\nNow why do you get pissed off at them asking for raises (regardless if it's 1.7% or something else) instead of the administrators taking bonuses 3x the amount that the 800 workers want? This \"evil administrators\" card gets played all the time. [They aren't paid nearly as much as you'd think](http://data.illinimedia.com/salaries/index). In fact, the vast majority of them would make far more working for private companies. Take a moment to actually look at what the deans are making - realize that they all have stacked resumes and advanced degrees. I'm sure I'll be downvoted to hell because I'm going against the grain on this one, but seriously, these people are usually making much less money than they would in private industry - because they actually DO give a shit about students and want to help them. Wow, the football coaches are paid over one million dollars a year? And we still suck this bad?!\n\nWhat the flying fuck. This is all to entertain some students? I am always surprised by the ability of this school to waste money, when it really doesn't have much. The school isn't wasting money. The salaries of the athletic department are paid for separately - by the athletic department. Your tuition does not go to them.\n\nThat being said, yeah, one million dollars to win 2 games a year? I think I might be able to win 1 game a year for 500k... This \"evil administrators\" card gets played all the time.

The question is, why are admin positions multiplying and tenure positions decreasing? Broadly speaking, of course, UIUC may be different in this regard, but over the entire higher education industry it is a verifiable trend.\n\nLast time I checked admins didn't teach courses. So why the fuck are there more admins and less professors, and why the fuck do we pay so much tuition just to, more or less, be taught by fucking grad students?\n\nShort answer: the administration is incompetent. That's a different discussion entirely - but I'll play along.\n\nOne: Let's assume that it's as you say - the administration is incompetent. What's your solution?\n\nIf the administration is incompetent, then we need to hire a higher caliber of employee - somebody who can competently perform their jobs. OK. To draw in higher quality administration, what do we have to do?\n\nOh, right. Pay them more.\n\n______\n\nTwo: Let's look at our current administration, and figure out what the problem is. Incompetent administrators - the problem. And, let's say that higher pay is out of the question. Where are we getting our administrators from? A few I pulled off the top of my head:\n\n[Hirschi](http://abe.illinois.edu/faculty/M_Hirschi)\n\n[Ravaioli](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile.asp?ravaioli)\n\n[Andrejasich](http://www.arch.illinois.edu/people/faculty/andrejas/)\n\n[LAS's entire leadership, basically](http://www.las.illinois.edu/about/leadership/)\n\nWhat's the common theme? I've got one - they all came from their fields. None of them have actual degrees in administration. In fact, almost every single Dean started out as a professor. The administration is not, in fact, administrative professionals. It's a bunch of old professors.\n\nYou could see how this could be a problem.\n\nNow, here's two things I want to point out. 1) You're right, we have less tenured professors- because they keep going into administration. 2) We have established a status quo of all administrators being ex-professors.\n\nThis status quo is an issue - and here's why; when an actual professional administrator comes in, the professionals can't do their jobs right. Weird, right? The faculty is used to the administrators being other ex-professors who \"worked their way up;\" lo and behold, they don't listen to the professional administrators. And just like that, your competent professional administrators are rendered useless - and not due to any incompetence or fault of their own, but in fact because of the professors - who we try so hard to hold blameless.\n\nIt's funny, things aren't nearly so simple as they seem at first.  &gt;If the administration is incompetent, then we need to hire a higher caliber of employee - somebody who can competently perform their jobs.\n\nThis is a short-sighted answer. Sometimes incompetence exists because of the individual, but most of the time it exists because of administrative structures. Put all the UIUC administrators in an institution that is designed better and you'll get better employees most of the time.\n\nOf course, this is America, and we tend to believe individual effort is everything, but at the end of the day context is usually far more important. I suppose I should have pointed this out to begin with, but it usually doesn't occur to me to include my broader philosophy in every post.\n\n&gt;1) You're right, we have less tenured professors- because they keep going into administration. 2) We have established a status quo of all administrators being ex-professors.\n\nI'm glad ex-professors take up administrative roles. It shouldn't be any other way, but it's incorrect for you to say this phenomenon is what is causing less tenured professor positions to exist. It's a budgetary reason it's happening, it isn't happening because there aren't quality professors out there looking for a job.\n\n&gt;And just like that, your competent professional administrators are rendered useless - and not due to any incompetence or fault of their own, but in fact because of the professors - who we try so hard to hold blameless.\n\nSo, everything is the professor's fault? In that case lets fire all the professors. What do these silly professors know about education compared to somebody who has never stepped foot into a classroom?\n\nI, for one, am not interested in putting our schools into the hands of corporate suits who only know how to focus on numerical metrics. Teaching to the test and multiple-choice scantron tests are already prevalent enough in our educational institutions, we don't need to put people in charge who will only increase such things. Jesus, have we learned nothing from Leave No Child Behind?\n\n&gt;It's funny, things aren't nearly so simple as they seem at first.\n\nWhat's funny is that you bought into the bullshit lie that generic MBAs can do a great job in any industry. Every industry is different, and you want people to run things who understand those differences. You don't want some suit who only knows generic business practices to come in and be in charge.\n\nPS: You get an upvote from me because fuck Redditors who can't notice a decently constructed argument. You shouldn't have been downvoted. &gt;This is a short-sighted answer. Sometimes incompetence exists because of the individual, but most of the time it exists because of administrative structures. Put all the UIUC administrators in an institution that is designed better and you'll get better employees most of the time.\n\nAgreed. I don't believe in that argument one bit - it just bothers me that people argue that the administration is incompetent and underpaid - and then offer NO solution whatsoever. I actually am not nearly as pro-administration as these arguments might make me look - but everyone loves to beat that stupid \"The administration is incompetent\" drum, and it drives me up the bloody wall.\n\n&gt;So, everything is the professor's fault? \n\nNo. There needs to be balance. A whole bunch of professors and nobody who has been trained to administer = A clusterfuck where nobody knows how to get things done. A whole bunch of administrators and nothing else = A clusterfuck where nobody knows what needs to be done. There is an absolute need for both kinds of people. Similarly, there's no reason that the professors shouldn't take courses in how to properly work in university administration - the U of I has specific courses in how to properly administer to a university; why aren't we taking advantage of them?\n\n&gt;I, for one, am not interested in putting our schools into the hands of corporate suits who only know how to focus on numerical metrics. Teaching to the test and multiple-choice scantron tests are already prevalent enough in our educational institutions, we don't need to put people in charge who will only increase such things. Jesus, have we learned nothing from Leave No Child Behind?\n\nThat's hyperbole. There are issues - for instance, a professor recently was unhappy with the way that students were performing in his studio classes. This was one of the colleges where a professor's students' performance can affect whether or not said professor gets tenure. The professor mandated 2 extra 3 hour studios per week - on a Thursday and a Sunday - and said that if the students didn't come to these studios that were not on the syllabus, they would lose one letter grade per absence.\n\nHaving a professional administrator there to tell them \"Hey, you can't fucking do that\" is really important. In a lot of departments, those extra-curricular studios are part of the culture, and it's not a big jump to go from \"strongly encouraging\" to \"requiring;\" having that professional from an outside culture there protects against that.\n\n&gt;What's funny is that you bought into the bullshit lie that generic MBAs can do a great job in any industry. Every industry is different, and you want people to run things who understand those differences. You don't want some suit who only knows generic business practices to come in and be in charge.\n\nDidn't say generic MBA, don't buy into that lie. I said a professional administrator - someone who specializes in administration in education. Do I want a businessman in there? No. I want a guy with a degree like [this](http://education.illinois.edu/epol/programs/edadmin).   I agree that the University administration is for the most part a group of selfish morons, but my experiences over 2 years with dining workers has not been good either. The majority of them act like it is the biggest pain in the world to prepare food for me, and when it is busy and food is out they just saunter around like they don't care one bit. So it's not like they are righteous, always hard working employees either Not all dining hall workers are like that, I know a good amount of dining and other building workers that are always doing their job, are friendly,  and always have a smile on their face as they work. I see where you're coming from though, I have also seen some that act like it's such an inconvenience to do their job, but it's not everyone.

They did this two years ago when I lived there. I lived on the first floor and could hear them demanding better conditions at the top of their lungs. Nothing like being woken up at 6 AM by people demanding things. If anything I just rooted against them because they disturbed my sleeping patterns. ^ Typical selfish suburban kid. Fact: College is damn expensive, even with in-state tuition.\n\nFact:  Few things restrict academic performance as severely as sleep deprivation.\n\nFact:  For various reasons, many college students work late into the night, and at 6AM, may have only recently gone to sleep.\n\nFact:  Students and their parents both have the right to demand that they get the maximum value out of their college expenditure.\n\nWhile some students might be \"selfish suburban kids,\" and are only angry at the demonstrators for aggrivating their hangovers, there are lots of students who actually might be harmed.  How would you feel if you messed up an exam because you had been kept awake by protestors?  What if that one test dropped your grade in the class, resulting in the loss of a scholarship?\n\nThey're trying to use the students as pawns in their little chess game with administration, and in so doing, they're either forgetting or ignoring the fact that without the students, they wouldn't have jobs in the first place. &gt;Fact: For various reasons, many college students work late into the night, and at 6AM, may have only recently gone to sleep.\n\nlulz-worthy\n\nGuess what, the world doesn't stop for you, me, or anybody else. 6am is daytime. At 6am, it is legitimate for loud things to be going on outside your apartment.\n\nProtip: Most of the country is *not* on a college student's schedule.\n\nNow if they were protesting at 4am, that'd be a problem. To be fair, 6am is probably the earliest something like road construction or protesting could begin. \n\nKeep in mind lots of professionals wake up *before* 6am, especially those who have a long commute. I don't know about other places, but in my hometown, the noise ordnance forbids lawn-mowing or other loud noises before 8AM on weekdays.\n\nFurther, the world doesn't run on a college student's schedule, but oh, wait....where are we?  Right...Champaign-Urbana.  A *college town.* So what, because CU is a mid-sized city with a huge university everybody else who lives here is supposed to converge on a college students schedule? Wishful thinking.\n\nMost students on the UIUC campus are transplants, mostly from Chicago it seems.

Yet another thrilling D.I article...\n\n\nIm a math major so maybe my opinion is skewed, but does this article not just sound like a page of whining? Out of curiosity, did you test out of the calculus series courses or did you take them?  I would say that the courses are okay, but when you compare their structure and organization to that of PHYS 211 and 212, they are quite lacking.  He makes a good point with the lectures, too: many engineering students go through basic math classes where they are shown nothing but proofs and example problems on the chalkboard.  Generally engineers understand concepts better if they are taught intuitively rather than through rote methods.\n\nHe's definitely whining a little, but there aren't many other ways to point out that the math department may need to fix a few issues. I tested out of Calc I,II and took calc III freshman year. I don't have a basis for comparison having never taken Phys 211,212 unfortunatly. I understand an engineer being disappointed in the prevalence of proofs, but bear in mind that it is a math class and a lot of math majors are in the class too. \n\nIll be the first to admit that the class and the department are far from perfect (Im a double major and like the econ department significantly more), but as someone above mentioned the writer lists the math department's shortcomings, but doesn't seem to provide any constructive ideas as to how to improve them them.

Believe me, no one complains about the lack of proofs.  Yet another thrilling D.I article...\n\n\nIm a math major so maybe my opinion is skewed, but does this article not just sound like a page of whining?  &gt; This exposes the deeper problem that many professors simply do not care about teaching and consequently have diverted all of their attention to their research.\n\nDing ding ding! We\u2019re a Research I institution. Research is so highly valued here that deplorable teaching\u2014especially in the sciences\u2014is pretty much par for the course. I don\u2019t know how to fix this, but it\u2019s something that students (and prospective students) should keep in mind. Granted, I haven't hit 400 level courses yet, but I can only think of two teachers I didn't care for and I took Calc 2 -&gt; 286. Only one was particularly bad (an ECE course), and the other just wasn't a good fit with me because I was too stubborn to read the book (calc 3 prof). I don't think the \"professors are busy doing research and don't care about teaching\" argument holds as much water as people think it does. Granted this is anecdotal, and I have an advantage in that I get early registration, but even most of my friends haven't gotten stuck with horrendous professors.      This guy talks about how awful their teaching methods are but offers no solution. I don't know what he expects them to change. Proofs are a pretty fundamental part of mathematics and there's really no going around it. He also seems to expect to be babysat by the teacher, complaining that the teacher didn't assign problems.I hope he realizes that there's nothing stopping him from doing these problems on his own. This whole article seems like one large exaggeration. This guy talks about how awful their teaching methods are but offers no solution. I don't know what he expects them to change.

Proofs really aren't a fundamental part of Math 285 or 415, though... :/\n\nAnd his 285 and 415 instructors really did both have an average of 1.3 on ratemyprofessor, with plenty of data points. :) Remember that the minimum is 1, not 0.      I took CalcI\\II over at UIC. Was really a fan of their teaching model (or maybe i just got good professors). \n\nAnyway there would be 3 lectures and 2 optional discussions a week. Lectures would consist of professors doing some basic proofs but mostly spending time explaining really hard problems to you, then assigning tricky problems for homework. Then the exams would consist of prettying much the basic concepts of the material we learned, \ni.e. integration of parts would have a relatively easy problem that didn't involve obscure trig identities. \n\nHere i feel it is the opposite teachers spend time teaching the absolute basic concept (proofs), then expect you to apply those proofs to really hard problems on the exams.  That would be a great change of pace for math problems. I hated having to memorize obscure trig identities yet have almost no application of them on exams.  Im really against the idea that test should try to trick the user as much as possible. I feel like if you can get the basic idea of integration by parts, you can easily figure it out when you need to do more challenging things. \n\nSo go on make the homework as hard as you can, but dont expect\n us to be able to do the same problems while under the stress of an exam.

There is always a line till the door and for that price you can have a meal at a Mexican restaurant with chips, salsa, service and a guaranteed place to sit. Ordering online is a lifesaver. I love walking past everyone in line, picking up my food, and looking like a proud motherfucker on my way out the door.\n\n(but Super Taco &amp; Mas Amigos are both much better options) Good idea, but unless I go there in person I don't get to try out the [tricks](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s376a/my_uncle_orders_his_mcdonalds_fries_with_no_salt/c4aw2zh) I've recently learned to get the most bang for the buck (almost 7 bucks) at Chipotle. You can probably get away with doing that online. They let you get both kinds of beans at no charge, and you can ask for whatever in the comments. I dunno if they'd give you 2 tortillas though.

I run a bit, but I want to start putting on muscle. I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to working with weights and lifting. I'm thinking about getting a trainer at least once a week to learn how to lift/so I don't kill myself, etc. \n\nAnyway, any experiences, recommendations for trainers?  I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/ Ignoring quality issues (I can't speak as to the quality of personal trainers, so we'll ignore that), for many people spending money on something psychologically affects how they view it.  \n\nIf you have paid for an appointment, it is a lot easier to make sure you put the time/consistency in, and for many people, this can be very important to make sure they follow through.\n\nFor many people (myself in the past) consistency is more important than the quality of their workout, and I feel a small investment to ensure that isn't a bad thing.

I paid $50 for a group fitness pass one semester thinking it would motivate me to go to the gym to get my money's worth, but I went to exactly 3 classes that semester. In general I think gym memberships are often underutilized, people buy a membership as a New Year's resolution and then give up on it after the first few weeks. I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/ Why is that? My roommate is a NASM certified personal trainer, and he has been for 4 years now. I'm fairly certain he knows what he is doing. Plus 1-on-1 personal training is only 25$ per session or 20$ per session if you buy 10 sessions, which is fairly cheap. Why spend money on something you can get for free? My roommate is also a trainer, and he's legit, but OP would likely reach his goals just as fast with an experienced workout partner. Oh I completely agree, but if OP had an experienced workout partner to learn from, they probably wouldn't be posting this.  I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/  I'm going with what logged_in_for_this said: stay away from the personal trainers. If you want to learn how to lift, I can guarantee someone from Illini Bodybuilding Club or Illini Powerlifting would be happy to teach you. I'd personally be happy to teach you if you are free to hit the ARC in the evenings. Any of these options would allow you to build muscle a lot more efficiently than what most PTs can offer you.\n\nWith that said, if you're bent on going with a personal trainer, I would highly recommend going with Matt Clark or Sergio Luna. I know them personally, and they take training very seriously. Can vouch for Sergio, here. Workout buddy (to some degree) of mine. Dude definitely knows what he's talking about and doing and he's just an overall great guy, too. Yeah, definitely! I feel like he's one of few who are actually driven to be a PT or in the RST program. It really is his thing.\n\nBtw, do I know you? I'm James, the guy who started the Illini Bodybuilding Club. Okay, next question... I don't know if you're the right person to ask, but if I do want to work with Sergio, do I still have to fill out this [sheet](http://www.campusrec.illinois.edu/personalTraining/) online?\n\nIt seems like that would randomly assign me a trainer, and I'd rather work with one of the people you recommended.  Yeah, definitely! I feel like he's one of few who are actually driven to be a PT or in the RST program. It really is his thing.\n\nBtw, do I know you? I'm James, the guy who started the Illini Bodybuilding Club. Nah, probably not. My name's Kelton and I've worked in with him a couple times and chat with him every time we're both down there now. I generally work out alone but have considered joining one of the groups (powerlifting/bodybuilding) for the social aspect or advice/pointers. Ah, okay. Yeah, you should join the Facebook page. If you see someone in a club shirt, feel free to say hi too. I'm going with what logged_in_for_this said: stay away from the personal trainers.

I know them personally, and they take training very seriously. I'm a co-worker of Sergio's and can also vouch for him. He is amazing at what he does and has an incredible view on fitness/lifting/nutrition etc. You should definitely make an appointment to meet with him. You won't regret it.  Hey, how do I make an appointment to meet him, like I said earlier, it seems like I'm just supposed to fill out a form and they assign someone to me. \n\nIs there any way I can request him?  I've met and talked with several of them and they are nice people.\n\nThat being said, personal trainers are best for people who just can't get motivated to go to the gym for any reason. Their business model exists to get you to keep paying them, when in reality a personal trainer could teach you everything you need to stop requiring their services in four or five sessions. If you're an *absolute* newbie, my recommendation would be to buy [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360247917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=starting+strength). It's not the end-all be-all of weight training, but it's the best I know of for a beginner.\n\nAs to the ARC trainers specifically, I have seen some of them doing good work, and others doing bullshit bosu ball core crap. I have seen at least one training clients to squat with improper form. They may be correcting their form over a few sessions. After they get hurt?    I am a current client of a personal trainer at the ARC (Sergio). I have been working with him for almost a month now. As a student who started off as a complete beginner (I had a trainer for 3 months last semester) having a trainer helps immensely. I *highly* recommend a personal trainer if you can afford it. Having someone who is NASM certified to construct your fitness plan based on your own personal goals is completely worth it. \n\nAlso having a personal trainer is great for instruction. It's not always how much you train or what you do, it's *how* you do it. Technique in the beginning is essential to ensure that you don't get hurt and that your training is more fruitful. \n\nYou probably won't need a personal trainer forever. You are constantly learning while you're training. Also think of all that money you spend as an investment in your future, being a healthy, fit person. It would be a shame to spend that money on medical bills from being out of shape or overweight.

Honestly, I'm pretty firmly rooted in my beliefs.  They won't be able to change me one bit.  But its interesting to hear things from their perspective. They didn't really argue/debate, they just attempted to dodge the subject of Joseph Smith's reputation, the characters that Lucy Harris copied being declared nonsense, or how Joseph Smith was unable to reproduce the Book of Lehi when the original manuscript was lost.

I left the store with my laptop, refusing to pay such a ludicrous price for a simple procedure and searched online for a replacement screen. Found the one I needed within a minute on amazon for 50 bucks, and a tutorial video on how to replace the screen myself.

I always got the slimy-car-salesman feeling from them. I called them to get parking for my current apartment last year and I was assured that there were over 5 garage parking spots left, and was quoted prices for indoor and outdoor parking.

I asked them to add it to the lease but they gave me some corporate response saying there was no need to blah blah blah and it was already June and it was the last 1bdr under $600 in west campus. So it was that or I had to go live in Urbana not close to my classes. Regardless it felt good to take a stab at them for once.

So I signed a lease with CPM for next year. What exactly is so terrible about them, and what alternatives are there on campus. I looked into roland and jsm, their stuff is way to expensive.  They just neglect buildings until the last possible minute. They will penny pinch and cut as many corners as possible. They talk out of their ass and make so many promises and offer you \"free parking pass\" (they do actually give you the pass). They are rude and come in whenever they please to show your apartment. They will asses as many fees as possible for any little thing. They come at your for bogus \"no rent paid\" claims and if you don't stand up they won't back down. My TV was stolen from them over the summer and they flat out denied that anyone was in there even though there was a note left by a CPM worker. They didn't even return calls from the police and its not like most care to go the extra mile. My friend had his laptop stolen another had his Xbox stolen. They are liars and thief's. One guy who's as bipolar as they come is Jerome. Hes the tall black guy. He's seems as professional and nice as anyone but once you lease he doesn't care what you have to say is extremely rude and condescending. All I'm all I have lived with Roland, University Group, and CPM. Even though they all cut corners somewhere CPM is flat out incompetent. They get tenants every year because of their low rents but they have the worst reviews. The other ones are worth the extra money. So I signed a lease with CPM for next year. What exactly is so terrible about them, and what alternatives are there on campus. I looked into roland and jsm, their stuff is way to expensive.  So I signed a lease with CPM for next year. What exactly is so terrible about them, and what alternatives are there on campus. I looked into roland and jsm, their stuff is way to expensive.   lessee of CPM here, I had very low expectations from all that I heard about cpm. While living in my apartment all year, they have fixed things that we didnt even ask for, changed ALL the mattresses and box springs within a day of the inquiry, remodeled the cabinets cause we asked them too, and patched a hole in the wall... Everyone needs to learn how to fix small things and stop expecting everything to be done at their whim. Other people are just as busy as you.

Might I ask what conservative group got kicked out and why? Academy on Capitalism and Limited Government Fund.\n\nhttp://chronicle.com/article/U-of-IllinoisConserva/41752/\n\nProfessors thought it would affect the University's research. Can we not? We just chased a conservative group off campus because we believed it would influence academics at the university. Inviting a foreign government seems like it would do more of the same. Mandarin is a very important language that doesn't get enough exposure in the US. More people speak Mandarin than English in this world, and yet American educational institutions ignore it in favor of familiar languages like German and French. These languages have merit as well, but when you consider that most Mandarin speakers also speak English at some level, it's pretty clear that Americans are behind the curve when it comes to learning other languages. Don't be so quick to assume that this is some infiltration attempt - it has been assessed as very low risk, and it is a downright useful program to have. We let the EU and the Austrian government fund educational programs on our campus, why not give the Confucius Institute a chance? I could not find the Austrian government funded educational program here, so I cannot comment on their contributions. The EU group runs it's own degree rather than offering money to another established group on campus. Additionally the EU represents a huge chunk of Europe encompassing many ideals. The Confucius Institute is offering money to a group that already studies multiple countries in east asia. I can't find out if the money is no-strings-attached money or not. Would the Chinese government be fully OK with their money being used to study issues in Japan? If that is not the case, then this is the so called \"Influencing research priorities\" that people are worried about.\n\nEDIT: Why not support the Freeman fellows? They've been on the brink of closing for years. I am a Chinese student. I got an intern in Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China. From my experience in MFA-PRC,here is what I can tell you:\n1) Although China is one of a super powers country in the world, it only has economic influence. According to a survey conducted by The Times, majority of western country residents think China is a autocratic country like old Russia. It is true that China is still ruled by one party but compare to Russia or India, the \"autocratic\" government is more efficient and has more probity. The stereotype of \"undemocratic\" country ignored the fact China is trying to more democrat and a complete democratic election may not be good for China. To increase the political power and change the stereotype, it is important for foreigners know that our government is more efficient than some other democratic country, for example India or Russia. We also want foreigners know more about our culture. Not just ancient culture but also popular culture like our movie, our books our TV. The academic classes normally will not discuss modern China as the way our government want. So it is necessary for us build an institution to  show American a real China.  This is not brain washing because we just present facts, present how does our cities look, how it used to look like, our TV, our music everything... We want you to draw conclusion after seeing our achievement.  It is not a political propaganda, it is simply display how modern China looks like and then you will see the China is way much better than your thought.\n\n2) Freeman follows and some other USA scholarship are truly brain washing. They try to convince participants that they should use their experience to tell Chinese people what their government or society should be by letting them talking to normal people. But they ignore the face that what fits for America doesn't necessarily fit for China. For example, like direct election. There will be lot of bribery happened in the undeveloped area. \n\n3) True, the whole \"Confucius Institute\" program seems like a little bit political. But please understand that there exist too many misunderstanding regrading China. It is one of government's responsibility to clarify these worries. Isn't that also what USA try to do in Cuba by building culture center to let Cuban people a real America for good? We admit that we are not a real democratic country but please don't just look that part, there is also a part that you will be amazed. For example, I am a Chinese student. I like my life and my country. Though I can't use Facebook or Twitter but I still have many interesting to do. I can criticize my government if I have enough evidence showing I am right. If a local government office is corrupted I can still tell media to expose that. We are more open and transparent than you think! A fun fact, Chinese government does not have my fingerprint but USA government does! Who can tell what does that mean? It is really important for USA people know that because it already affects the business and career of normal Chinese people' lifes.  (US government rejected Huawei's acquisition , Harder for Chinese Students to Get a Work Visa in US, Worriedthat outsourced and cheap Chinese products will hit American economy) It is important for everyone know we are open and clean.\n\nSo yes, be open mind, you will see a different China through \"Confucius Institute\" Don't you enjoy the diversity Japan Garden brought to campus?\n\n\n\n To the rest of the world, what you are saying may sound brainwashed. Adult citizens being told by their government what they can and cannot do with regard to basic things like accessing information on the internet or how many children you can have will sound like a basic human rights violation to many people. From what I hear:\n\n1. The government severely restricts/monitors the internet (Facebook, twitter, certain Google searches. Surprisingly reddit is still not blocked, maybe the government doesn't know about it?). If you don't know what happens in the rest of the world and your government controls what information you can access, the way China is ruled will be the only way you know and it will seem normal to you.\n1. You don't elect your government, you have no say in how your country is run.\n1. There is a big divide between the rich and the poor - you allow the US and other developed countries to use your severly underpaid countrymen and women to produce goods for these countries.\n1. Your government tells you how many kids you can have. If you have a second one by mistake, your choices are to pay a hefty fine or abort it. Since boy children are more valued in China, I hear female foeticide is pretty common - since they can have only one child, they want it to be a boy, leading to a skewed sex ratio.\n1. The government rules with an iron fist, not allowing any dissidents, and [didn't allow the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo to accept his prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo#Nobel_Peace_Prize), and initially even censored information about him winning the prize. \n\nI think people who grew up in a democracy would find it very disconcerting if they had no choice in electing leaders or affecting laws and policies, and if their government gets to decide what is best for them. Believe or not, you can everything you said in China are just be fine.Because we are not Iran or North Korea, to some extent, we do have speech freedom. You can say everything above we already got answer for you:\n1.True. Block information sucks. But one thing about social network is that there too many rumors. And normally people just tend to believe these rumors because they don't trust anyone besides their own family.  If you use the Chinese social website, you are personnel information will be recorded but only authorized government staffs know. So in future if anyone lied to your friend about you on Facebook and want to get evidence, they can resort to government. It is a compromising solution that both protect privacy and stop rumors.\n\n2. Election means money. We don't want to waste money on election if you no big change will be made if you elected both party.  But we do have congress called Ren min dai bao da hui , where people elected one of their neighbor represent them to reflect their concerns to government. It is kind of election. Many people hadn't done that but from inner news I have heard that, government is working on that. Soon not only people live in rural area but also people live in urban area will also get chance to elect their Ren Min Dai Biao.\n\n3.True there is big divide but another thing is living cost in China is dramatically varies in different area of China. Living cost (food electricity and housing ) will have no big difference (more than 50%) between Illinois and Montana but living cost of Beijing or Shanghai could be 100 times of the living cost of the undeveloped western China. There isn't lots of people suffered from hunger. (It is kind a big achievement, if you don't believe it, take look of India, still there are lot of people in India are suffer from hunger). The difference of rich and poor people are decreasing now because a new amendment just passed last week to charge rich people more tax and use these money to help poor people( like Obama did. But still, the tax we charged is still far less than the tax Obama charged)  So, the difference is not that big and we are working on that.\n\n4) To be fair, if we don't control population , we won't have enough food or resource, seriously can you feed those extra babies? How about let half of Chinese population immigrate to USA? We are also working on that, here is our policy now 1) if you are a minority you can still have more than one child. that's our respect to minority race , for example like Tibetatian 2) if both you and your wife are from single-child family, you are allowed to have more than one child \n\n5) Liu Xiaobo commit a criminal, trying to make a riot. You can't just based on his word, you should really say what he did. He believed that people lived in western country are more educated and thus these western countries should colonized China for 300 years to help us get used to democrat system. What a bullshit! He said lots of racist words too. (He is a racist of his own race. I feel like he just simply hate of being a Chinese and wished to born as a American white male.) And also his word did bother some innocent peoples's life and according to law he should lived in jail. Everything is legal, if you don't believe that you can check our court record. We have enough evidence to sue him. Prisoners should not leave the jail.\n\nTrue, many Chinese people are complaining about our government. But there are way much people believe that by their hard working can bring fortune to themselves and bring prosper to country. In fact, if you ask a random Chinese student in Champaign, they will say appreciate their life today and do not want the democratic changes affects our society. Government are also changing for them by putting effort on issues they really care like education (college tuition is way much cheaper in China) or health care( Beijing residents can get most of the money they spend on medical service refunded ). Without western democracy we can still survive, but without a good education and health care system, you can't even complain!\n\nAll I want to say is please, throw your our thought stereotype toward China away.\" Confucius Institute\" is a great chance for you to know a real modern China. We should appreciate it. \n\nDemocracy is not the only solution. The political system of China may turned out to be best for a country with such a huge population and could be used in other country like India, North Korea, Pakistan or Iran...

The name \"Fighting Illini\" pre-dates the Chief Illiniwek symbol and was bestowed upon the team in honor of Illinoisans who fought in World War I; the use of the name \"Illini\" dates to the 19th century.\n\nNice!  The senate didn't save a damn thing; people are just misinformed about where \"Fighting Illini\" actually came from.\n\n&gt;co-sponsored a well-attended debate between the College Democrats and Republicans. \n\nGood, just what everyone needs.  College aged kids arguing about politics.  So useful, and no one ever hears it enough.\n\n&gt;In November, ISS passed a resolution urging the University to divest from coal, an issue at the University for quite some time\n\nIn November, good job!  From:\n\nhttp://www.dailyillini.com/features/article_dd73d7f5-602f-5ef7-a88a-57f72fc8a8ad.html\n\n\"[Abbot is] currently in the middle of a transition away from coal, as called for by the University\u2019s 2010 Illinois Climate Action Plan, or iCAP. The iCAP aims to eliminate all coal use at Abbott by 2017.\"\n\nWay to be on time and relevant, ISS.  Please don't change.\n\n&gt;Just last month, we established the iRent Program and rented out free iClickers to students, saving them about $8,000.\n\nFuck you.  Get more professors to start putting the homework questions online or handed out in class, so students can buy old versions of textbooks for $20, not $200.  You know, something useful, instead of a $20 bauble that we'll use several times throughout our education.  The iclicker is probably the best thing we buy, in a uses:cost ratio.\n\n&gt;We passed a resolution urging the University to remain \u201ccarry-free\u201d due to the proposed firearm changes in Illinois\n\nSo, earlier, he was talking about good debates and political views.  Shouldn't this have been decided there, instead of by the ISS?  Not that their resolution would do anything.   WE'RE IN ILLINOIS.  You're about as likely to get the government in Georgia to start handing out posters promoting abortion clinics as concealed carry on this campus.  [Oh yeah, I have a source for this:](http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx)\n\n&gt;there are 21 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus: Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming.\nIn 23 states the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nIt sure is likely that Illinois, which *still* doesn't have concealed carry (yet), is going to force the campus to have concealed carry.  Good job.  The ISS, again, passes a resolution akin to \"The sun should rise tomorrow\".\n\n&gt;Many students, despite our efforts, still don\u2019t know who we are or how we can help them. Promotion is an important part to any organization\u2019s success.\n\nNo, it's just like regular politics, but to an even lesser degree (at least they can pass binding resolutions).  We've heard of the ISS (lord knows we see enough sidewalk chalk), but as long as it keeps its hands out of our pockets to do nothing and play the silly resume fluff game, we don't care.\n\n\n&gt;we avoided a possible split from the graduate delegation through committee reconstruction.\n\nDon't care.  again, stupid internal games.\n\n&gt;Although some senators may disagree with our spending, they are hypocritical in doing so. The same senators mocking our efforts actively participate in the Senate\u2019s work. \n\nI'm not even sure how to begin addressing this bullshit point.\n\n&gt;The events that we host and co-sponsor are beneficial, such as the College Democrats and Republicans debate. \n\nI see why this is the point that she chose to raise again.  It's the *least* asinine \"accomplishment\".\n\n&gt;To argue that the Illinois Student Senate has done nothing this year but promote itself is incorrect. \n\nGood point!  Time and money wasted, with no real accomplisments.\n\n&gt;Rest assured, we will continue to be the voice of our constituents and welcome anyone to attend our Wednesday meetings to voice their concerns. Remember, elections are coming up, so if you want to directly change this organization, the power is in your hands.\n\n\nThe only useful part of the whole thing. Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume? Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume?  Does the ISS have any *real* power?  Are any of their decisions binding upon the Board of Trustees, or do they just pass non-binding resolutions expressing the \"sense of the student senate,\" similarly to how Congress declares \"Turnip appreciation day\" or \"National gravity awareness week\"?  I have twice said (on Reddit) the ISS does nothing to improve my education. This article hasn't done anything to change the factual accuracy of that statement. \n\nFacilitating a debate between students arguing within a false dichotomy? Passing resolutions that amount to nothing more than recommendations (and pointless ones at that, grade replacement for transfer credits, lol-worthy)? What the hell is the female leadership program supposed to do, and why should any of us believe the ISS knows anything about leadership? What else? Coal? Like the university administration isn't already aware of the issue. No-carry? Thanks for letting the next armed nutcase walk on to campus knowing none of us can fire back. \n\nAsking a private company to divulge their budgetary information? Here's an idea, instead of laying on some private company why don't you apply pressure to the UIUC administration to lower tuition and fees? Oh, that's right, it's an important issue directly affecting students, so obviously it isn't an issue the ISS cares about.\n\nThe article is a typical non-answer.

In today's market, I've seen these exams going for maybe 100 to 150 dollars a piece, but that's from a perfect exam stand in. With this particular instance I'm a little suspect because of the location of the posting, and the non native language which suggests this may be a reproduction \"CS125 God.\"  \n\nI would put the value of this guy at about 50$ per exam, with the final being maybe 75$.   I was cruising that message board for a few minutes and it looks like this kind of \"job offer\" is not uncommon. Is it just an international student problem? Do these people think they can discuss this on a public forum in the most widely used language in the world and not get caught?\n\nEdit: Ok, to be fair, I read more of the forum on my bus ride to work. The vast majority of the posts are benign. There were 3 asking for people to take test/attend class on their behalf and 2 posts looking for people to write college admission essays on other's behalf. As someone who has been on both the student and teacher perspectives, I would like to offer this closing thought: everyone cheats, and Chinese international students are by far the most entitled and unapologetic cheaters.

I see them working very hard (at least the graduate students), so I wonder why they would need to cheat. &gt; Chinese international students are by far the most entitled and unapologetic cheaters.\n\nReally? I see them working very hard (at least the graduate students), so I wonder why they would need to cheat. That is my observation for undergrads only. I don't personally know any grad students that cheat, nor have I heard of anyone in my department blatantly cheating.  This is really interesting. I had a friend in MSE 401 last semester who observed that during an in-class quiz, one international student, wearing a white hoodie, asked to go to the bathroom, and another international student, this one wearing a purple hoodie, came back.\nWhat saddened me most about this was that it was unclear whether anything was done about this at all- I imagine it would have been pretty easy to prove that there was something academically dishonest going on. Your friend should have said something after class. Professor Dillon would have at least started watching that student more closely.  Remember kids, crime pays.  Anyone have a screenshot of the message that was posted? It has now disappeared. Word must have spread fast and reached the original poster. \n\nI'm also curious, is this kind of behavior accepted in Chinese culture - the end being more important than the means? If hypothetically I wanted to hire someone to take my exams, I would be too embarrassed to post it on a public message board, I would do it more discreetly to maintain some semblance of dignity/respectability. There must be many Chinese people on /r/uiuc - please clarify this for the rest of us. Do the others who read those boards simply accept it as normal and look the other way and leave these posts unreported? Even OP calls themself \"wasnotmybusiness\".

I'm going to overly generalize this but I feel like it's applicable to international students from all countries, not just China.\n\nMany come from VERY wealthy families. This should be pretty obvious as out of state tuition is already insanely high. I know a lot of people with wealthy backgrounds who fuck around 24/7.\n\nThe other percentage of international students came here with a lot of  hard work. Often times their families have spent all their savings in order to provide their children with a good education in the States.\n\nNo, it is definitely not accepted as a part of the culture. There are idiots in every culture. &gt; No, it is definitely not accepted as a part of the culture.\n\nI disagree. From what I've seen they have a very different cultural understanding of what constitutes cheating. During one of our \"ethics\" lectures, we had a group of chinese students argue with the professor that if you're sick for a week and can't make it to lecture, it's perfectly okay to copy your friend's homework since \"it wasn't your fault\". A large group of them also got caught buying past exams (which weren't supposed to be available) and when the professor found out they complained because they bought them fair and square. The entire exam results were thrown out.\n\nThings like this seemed much more common with the Chinese students than the other international groups. It's not that they want to be lazy --its the opposite. They care *so much* about succeeding that they go to great lengths to do it. &gt; No, it is definitely not accepted as a part of the culture.\n\nI disagree.

You don't just submit a thesis and get it, people would realize you haven't done a lick of research (plus things like qualifying exams and prelims).

Is it multiple choice or requires code? I'm guessing answers floating around won't be of much good for the test?  thread deleted ... :( did someone get a screencap?  I dont really understand why people make sucha a big deal about cheating. So what if some people get away with it on a few tests. Its gonna come back to bite them in the ass in subsequent courses, or when they try to find a job. \n\nEven if you somehow managed to cheat on every test and graduate with a 4.0, im sure you would not get past the interview process.  I agree somewhat: The curves in many core classes mean that a cheater who gets an A is robbing a deserving student of that A.\n\nThen again, grades aren't that important in CS if you're just trying to get a job after undergrad. They're just one method of earning a job interview with many companies.

How is banning smoking expensive? A) Enforcing the ban costs money (staff, processing)\n\nB) Setting up places to sequester the smokers (smoking huts, designated areas, etc)\n\nDo you have an idea of how much just those goddamn metal signs cost? It's ridiculous and most of of all DOES NOT MAKE THIS CAMPUS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE CASH-COW THAT IS INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS Two points:\n\n1) ISS did not sponsor or support the smoking ban. Regardless of what University officials may have said, the ban was conceived and promoted by the former Student Trustee - an elected official beyond the control of the ISS.\n\nI for one hate smoking, but a total ban on a campus this size is ill-advised and a clear violation of personal freedom.\n\n2) As a member of the Academic (faculty-student) Senate's committee on University Student Life, I don't remember smoking shelters or designated areas coming up in discussion. I wouldn't expect to see any. 1) The resources of the campus police or whoever would be enforcing this waste of time are not infinite, and either the university must spend more to add officers to not cut on policing elsewhere or they will be tied up doing garbage like citing people for smoking instead of driving around giving jaywalking tickets like we need them to (sarcasm on that last bit...) And yes, the funds for this sort of thing won't come from the ISS but they have to come from somewhere and I sure as shootin' know UIUC is not running a massive surplus.\n\n2) The shelters and such had been discussed by various people involved with the ban in the past, didn't realize there wasn't an a policy of \"hit the bricks, asshole\" instead of one of accomodation. Actually, it looks like they are going for more of a 'hit the bricks, asshole' approach.\n\nhttp://www.campusrec.illinois.edu/Smoke-Free/faq.html\n\n&gt;Question: Will there be designated smoking areas on campus?\n&gt;\nNo. Smoking will be prohibited on all campus grounds. There are two reasons for this:\n&gt;\nEstablishing designated smoking areas undermines the new policy. The purpose of the policy is to create a health-supporting community for everyone, tobacco-users and non-users alike. Creating smoking areas does not contribute to that purpose.\n&gt;\nSmoking zones and perimeter policies have not been found to be effective or enforceable, and smoking shelters are expensive to construct and maintain. Campuses with full smoke-free policies have reported fewer problems with compliance than policies that include smoking areas.  But guys, if we don't fund the Student Senate, then how else will they be able to pay for [more than $9,000 in self-advertisement?](http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/article_8b09184a-47e2-11e2-af22-001a4bcf6878.html)\n\nSeriously, I hate our student government for shit like this.  If other RSOs need to raise their own money if they want more than basic funding, why does the student government deserve special treatment? I can literally think of dozens of better ways to spend that money on campus.  Why give it to a bunch of entitled, self-involved clowns?\n\n1) Repaint the bike lanes on campus\n2) Improve CITES infrastructure/staff\n3) Build/improve bus shelters on some of the more common stops on campus\n4) Fix some of the aging AV systems in the classrooms on campus\n5) Better quality toilet paper for the restrooms on campus\n6) Improve the desks/chairs in some of the older classrooms\n7) Investigate safer ways to route street traffic through/around campus\n8) A student sponsored scholarship for underprivileged or underrepresented students\n9) An annual campus wide reward to recognize outstanding instructors\n10) Improve the security systems on the dormitories\n11) Pay for campus police to do extra patrols of some of the more dangerous areas on campus\n12) Replace/repair some of the damaged equipment in the ARC\n\nAnd those are just off the top of my head. To address your concerns:\n\n1. I've been told that Urbana and Champaign actually own these. Although that never made much sense to me, you'd get more traction calling your City Councilperson.\n2. Does anything in particular bother you about CITES?\n3. Again, I'm not sure if the shelters belong to the University or MTD. I'll look into it. Any stops in particular you'd like to see? (I spend most of my time north of Green, so I'm not ideally placed to know about the southern bus routes.)\n4. ISS once tried to have a ceiling projector installed in a room at the Union. The University wanted $15,000 just to install the mounting bracket and power outlet. That should give some perspective on how much an AV system costs.\n5. God yes, though I would wager the budget for toilet paper is more than any twenty students pay in tuition.\n6. Last I heard, the state of Illinois owes the University tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars for maintenance and renovation projects. Combine that with a multi-year planning, purchasing, and evaluation process, and renovating one classroom or lab can take the better part of a decade and $100,000. The Academic (faculty-student) Senate has started a lobbying effort with the state legislature to fix some of these issues, but it's going to be an uphill battle.\n7. There are Campus Committees dedicated to this kind of thing, but they often lack students willing offer input. [Apply here](http://www.iss.illinois.edu/ccapplication.aspx).\n8. Agreed.\n9. University administrators giving large cash gifts to faculty? That sounds like a recipe for corruption to me, but I'm a bit of a cynic. The ISS [gives out \"Teaching Excellence Awards\" annually](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/16wadn/seeking_nominations_for_teaching_excellence_awards/) by the way, based on student nominations.\n10. As a graduate student, I'm not familiar with security at the student dorms. Anything particularly concerning there?\n11. I agree that we need to up police presence on campus at night. I did my undergraduate at Virginia Tech, and the campus police there were far more active at night than here.\n12. Campus Rec receives a very generous budget from the University and student fees. If something is broken and not fixed quickly, it's most likely not been reported up to the people in charge. I can get you the contact info if you have specifics.\n\nAnything else? That was super interesting and informative, and I can tell you put a lot of thought and effort into it.  Thank you!  If I could transfer my karma down here to get more attention to your post, I would do it.  People should definitely read it.  I'm not going to do a point by point response to distract from it (but I do want to discuss all of this more!)\n\nThe reason for my list was more to make the point that an increase in tuition should go toward improving the life of students on campus, and that I could easily think of some of those ways off the top of my head.

No. I cannot see what the Student Government would need with $85,766 annually.

Keep in mind that number is for... you know... *actual businesses*. Unless they're swimming in printer ink, I refuse to believe that they can run through that much money.\n\nI hope that their actual *spending* was nowhere near the amount that they *budgeted*. The average business doesn't have to print out **54 copies of everything**.\n\nBecause each senator has to receive the agenda, minutes, and pieces of proposed legislation in print at the meetings, the ISS goes through a mountain of paper and ink - even printing two pages per side and double-sided. (It has been suggested that this be done digitally only, but that would unfairly exclude student senators unable to afford electronics.) Then you start piling on staples, binders (for storing all those documents until the session ends), pens, printer repair/replacement costs...\n\nI don't think the amount spent comes near the budgeted amount in the end, but that budget reflects a sort of worst case scenario. (That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Why not just hold your meetings in a lecture hall with powerpoint capability?   \nCouple that with reminding senators that there are plenty of tech labs on campus, you'd save a significant amount of money on supplies regardless of what it actually is.

(That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Honestly, many students (if not most) have either a laptop or smartphone, or something to read digital documents off of. And if they don't they can print out a copy before the meeting.   I wish that most of the students who would be voting on this could see the discussion going on here. I feel like a big problem in this referendum wll be all the students who don't know anything about the issue (myself included) who read the question and say \"meh, 2 dollars, no big deal, and anyway it boosts student power\" and don't know exactly what the ISS does. To this date I still don't know what the ISS does, all I've seen are ads from them. Frankly I think my residence hall's executive board puts on better events than they do, and their funding comes from the University Housing payments so they're not about to charge students just to entertain them. When is voting going on?\nI did not hear about this until I saw this thread and I can't find information about this online.    I am a prior Student Senator. I think that the separate fee is not a good pursuit of the Student Senate's time and energy. The Student Senate had significant independence some time ago (pre-2008 IIRC) and it resulted in some heavy corruption, but also a huge restructuring by the Senate in self-policing and oversight. While I was there, we had great Treasurers that ensured everything was financially accounted for, and frequently wound up . That said, the Student Senate can often get a little bit pushed around by the University administration to toe the line on some issues, so I can understand their desire to obtain financial independence from what the administration deigns to provide.\n\nSecond, people have asked what Student Senate even does. Are there a lot of fratstars in the Senate? Sure. It's a power position, it's bound to attract those kinds of people. However, we do a variety of things for the student body:\n\n-Lobbying Springfield on behalf of the student body and University (this is probably where most of the phone bill cost comes from). We also host the cost of bus transportation for the student body to assist on Illinois Day with lobbying.\n\n-Educating students about their rights regarding interactions with police. Given the degree of intoxication that goes on, we do this several times a year to try and provide some legal knowledge to the student body.\n\n-Hosting the Student Trustee debate (arguably the most important position in the student body)\n\n-Determining better use of traffic systems (I saw this point come up further down the page). There are committees that actually manage this. I was on one myself.\n\n-Serving as the sounding board of the student body. You get a diverse array of opinions in 40,000 students, and while individual groups can push for action on an issue, we serve as a way to pare down all those different opinions into one that is easily digestible by the administration. Dear God, you should have seen the debates that occurred about the administration's actions taken during the Next Dance.\n\n-Finally, I won't mince words. We also serve as an extra funding board for student issues. This can range from assisting Habitat for Humanity, multicultural social events, graduate student town halls, or environmental action nights. $9,000 on just advertising is a lot to drop and plain ridiculous. That would eliminate numerous valuable events that could have been held, and Activity Day is actually a better return on our investment ($12 registration fee for a table netting hundreds of interested students).\n\n**Source:** I am a former Student Senator, 2009-2010, and literally drafted by my classmates (I didn't choose to run until they put me on the ballot and voted me in based on my advocacy work regarding the MTD cuts that year). I got to experience developing the student body's stance on issues including the clout scandal and Chief's Next Dance). Thank you for giving us an insider's perspective.  If I may ask, how important do you think the student government's independence from the administration is?  Is the $60,000+ budget they are asking for justifiable, or is there a significant amount of wasted spending there?\n\nI ask because I there are some items from last year's spending--such as thousands spent on some sort of Big 10 student government conference--make me curious whether some money is spent on the senators and not on the functioning of the senate.\n\n(edit: some words)  No. As a suggestion, they can fine the smoking people and make that money.  This is actually how the first student government at UIUC funded themselves. Later governments stopped because it was really, really annoying... I was being sarcastic actually. Although I don't smoke I have no problem with the people smoking outside.

The really sad thing is that the senate is getting away from their true purpose and that is to stand up for the students not promote themselves through outrageous $9000 cheesy advertisements at sporting events.  I wasn't able to attend last weeks meeting, but since I was recently reappointed, I had a couple of senators on my behalf fight against a fund allocation for a 10 dollar name plate for me. I didn't want it, and I sure didn't want my constituents money spent on something that serves absolutely no purpose.  That is approximately 500 bucks wasted every year on stupid name plates.  Well apparently, there was a movement to amend the fund allocation to remove my nameplate, and it failed.  Fiscal irresponsibility at it's finest right there, and there is no reason there should be an additional fee if the ISS can't spend it's current budget wisely.

In my opinion, ISS continues to push itself further into obscurity.  Things have gotten notably worse within the organization.  They seem to spend a majority of their time talking about fund allocations and internal procedure, and less time on ways to represent students.  I can't say that I've ever heard more people use the word \"distinguished\" in a single meeting.     Is there a timeline for when this will be brought up in a meeting or when students can vote?     Many people here do not have a lot of money and many of them are on student loans. As a result, they should not be forced to pay additional fees, especially if there are having difficulty paying for tuition. If they want to implement a mandatory fee, it should only be for people who have extra money to spend.\n\nIf the Student Government needs money, I will gladly donate at least $10 if they give me an easy way to do so such as allowing me to charge the donation to my student account.\n  http://iss.illinois.edu/documents.asp\n\nA link to the ISS governing documents and their site for anyone who wants to look at such things.

Here's what I have to say about anything and everything:\n\n* 95% of the issues that piss people off are out of the control of us student workers (help desk &amp; lab sitter stations). All we can really do is notify the higher up staff who is already spread extremely thin. They try their hardest to do everything they do, but most of the IT Pros really do have a lot on their plate.\n\n* Part of what has happened recently is we are moving to \"unified services\". In the past every department (ECE, MechSE, CS, Aero, etc) had their own IT services. Some like TSG for CS was very good at it, specialized in CS needs, while other IT departments were horrible. Now it all resides under Engineering IT, which is a double edged sword.

Right guys? I mean we are all studying for finals and we don't have any projects or mps to complete. Right guys? But let's be honest. There are 6000 students logged in at any one moment over the rest of this week and next. You might have anticipated that? Just saying. I did, but so should EWS. How could we have made it better? Just saying. I agree with your point of view that money should be better spent on preparing for such incidents. I just hate when people keep saying shit like \"oh you should have started earlier\" and blah blah blah implying it's absolutely our fault. I guess there's nothing which will be done about it in the near future...  I mean we are all studying for finals and we don't have any projects or mps to complete. Right guys? [deleted] Sorry, I meant that comment to be sarcastic. I am in 290 as well and I can understand the frustration..  As someone who works engineering IT, fuck you. The Engineering department way underfunds us, and our servers can't handle 6000 students all trying to log in at once. I'm sorry we're not running a Google Data Center, could you please back off? Hey,\nYou or someone familiar with the details of how it all works, should do an AMA on the infrastructure, issues, etc behind EWS. I mean, I know the basics of how it all works. haha But I've only been on the EWS team for about 3 months. I can ask one of my redditing coworkers if they'll do it! Are you a full timer? I don't know of any full time people who reddit.  No, I'm an hourly student worker. But I poke around a lot. haha Yea same. I worked here over the summer and still don't know how it all works, because unlike what most people think, its pretty complicated.  As someone who works engineering IT, fuck you. The Engineering department way underfunds us, and our servers can't handle 6000 students all trying to log in at once. I'm sorry we're not running a Google Data Center, could you please back off? Why not?   Everyone else deploys to amazon AWS which can scale to add as  much demand as your dept would ever need. \n\nPlus it is easy and cheap. You could probably even supplement your own servers with EC2 AWS instances in a way that no one would know the difference.  Why not?

You could probably even supplement your own servers with EC2 AWS instances in a way that no one would know the difference.  Who exactly is \"everyone else\"? I've never heard of a college using AWS for IT services, and top of that, as kbotc points out so eloquently below, Amazon doesn't really give two shits about its users' privacy. Hence, we can't use it by federal law. By 'everyone else' I'm referring to a significant margin of modern IT, not necessarily university IT departments. \n\n[However university IT departments are using AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/education/)\n\nAWS has become really popular because of the ease at which you can deploy services and instances, scaling is super easy, and relatively inexpensive.  It allows really small teams to do the work of a much larger IT department.\n\nThe university nearly completely outsourced mail services to google and microsoft so cloud services aren't without question at the university level, and there is certainly a pathway to FERPA compliance.\n\n Who exactly is \"everyone else\"? I've never heard of a college using AWS for IT services, and top of that, as kbotc points out so eloquently below, Amazon doesn't really give two shits about its users' privacy.

But there are **hotels and coffee shops** that have 24/7 IT on-call and EWS doesn't?  Why is it that there's no *phone number* that I can call to reach you guys?  Why is it that it takes two days for email responses to ews@illinois.edu to go through?  Y'all are being paid for this for god's sake... how do you expect reliable outage intelligence and response when there is literally no client feedback involved? \n\nTrust me, I know it sucks working IT for a lot of users and being underpaid for it.  I've been there.  But goddamn it, we're paying enough to expect a functional network.  My frustrations aren't directed at you in particular, they're directed at whoever's fault that is.  I'm sure you know better than I.\n\nBut I know there are professors who pay thousands for managed instances, and I've seen that \"management\" at work.  Hours if not days to respond to e-mails, incompetent solutions, etc.  In the private sector, $1k a month will buy you some beef in a tier 1 datacenter, fully managed with e-mail response guaranteed within minutes, 99.99% uptime or your money back, and full support for flexible backups/restores as well as OS installation and software troubleshooting.\n\nAgainst pretty much all modern benchmarks, EWS and ENGRIT are jokes.  You literally have no idea what you're talking about. You can kindly go fuck yourself, because nothing you've said has been constructive or helpful, just whining like a little bitch. \n\nEdit: To attempt to answer your legitimate complaints, but just expecting you to be a dick about it: \n\n1) By \"Hotels and coffee shops\" I'm sure you mean multimillion dollar, nation wide companies. Pretty sure it makes sense for them to have something like that, not an extremely local and as nameless912 said, underfunded program like ours. Dude, wake up. \n\n2) Every time you send an email to ews@illinois.edu it gets sent to a queue. That queue is monitored by all the Helpdesk workers (ie students), a some of the full time staff. That means that if you send an email to us over the weekend, its not going to get answered unless one of us feels like answering easy tickets while on other duties, or the guy working at Siebel for 3 hours on Saturday and Sunday answers it. \n\n3) Everything else you said is just bullshit. If you think you know this much about how it should work, maybe you should come talk to the head of the department. I'm sure you can figure out who that is. \n\n4) By \"paying enough for it\", do you really think you can quantify that? You have no idea how much of your tuition comes to us, and as I've sort of figured out along the way, its not much.  Wow, *you're* telling *me* to calm down?  All I said is that our IT is a joke, and should be better for the amount of money we pay in.  I think you'll find it's not an unpopular opinion, and I only started taking an aggressive tone about it after this random guy who works at EWS responded to my headline by telling me to go fuck myself.\n\nI knew egos were bad in Engineering, but god damn, take some criticism.\n\nI know how the system works, and I'm just saying that in literally any serious IT for any organization ever with more than 50 concurrent users has 24/7 support.  My entire family works in IT, and I've spent several years doing the same bullshit.  It's pretty much a minimum requirement for any serious service... when you have 6,000 users, \"wait until tomorrow at 9AM when business hour start\" is simply not an acceptable response to an outage.

Functional network? I'd be willing to be donuts to dollars that the network was fine. My personal guess? The storage became overloaded and you couldn't get your NIS data, ergo, no log in. $1k would get you enough server space for about 1 concurrent engineering student per month. I'm going to guess you've never had to support a lab environment where your servers are getting hit by several thousand concurrent users who want to run compilers and modeling software. This is not exactly an easy task, no matter what you say.\n\nResponse is difficult due to privacy concerns. We can't outsource it, so we have to have the same folks who are trying to fix the problem responding to end users while professors are breathing down their neck. Not a pleasant situation for anyone. They're probably reading the email and not responding while they're working on the issue at hand. &gt;$1k would get you enough server space for about 1 concurrent engineering student per month.\n\nI think you could get *at least* 3 concurrent users, even of complex modelling/rendering software, on a properly designed $1k component of a larger cluster. I'd say you're likely very wrong. IO waits are going to kill you. They always do. Shared hosting is usually very terrible for that in particular.

EWS is a joke, because there is so much political bullshit going on between EWS and the College of Engineering. You're right, the amount we pay compared to the service we get absolutely BLOWS. But it's not our faults, it's the college of engineering being stupid with our money. And there is a phone number you can call, it's just not advertised well enough in the labs (217-333-1313). And for the record, the only reason it takes a few days for an email to be responded to is because we get literally hundreds of tickets a day, and have maybe 30 people that are working on the ticket system throughout the course of a day, usually no more than 10 at once.\n\nAlso, how do you expect 24/7 IT on call? We're mostly student employee run, our full timers have lives that they want to spend out of the office occasionally. And, without the support from the college of engineering we need, how can you expect 24/7 uptime and a 24 hour staff that can respond to server outages quickly? Or even servers with the capacity to support 6,000 login instances at once?\n\nEngineering IT and EWS are 3 years old. They have little departmental funding compared with what they need. They don't have many full time staffers. I'm sorry we're not the best tech department on the face of the Earth but Goddammit we're trying.\n\ntl;dr I'm sorry that you can't wait til 8 AM the next morning when your porn doesn't load on university computers. I'm not blaming you, I'm just venting.  Your inability to take what is, in my opinion, legitimate criticism speaks volumes towards the inability to tame such a large network of the current EWS staff.\n\nI've worked in 4 person IT shops.  4 people running ~50 boxes.  We had someone on call 24/7 and we each made about $1,000 a month.  In the private sector, this shit costs peanuts.\n\nThe first time I e-mailed, I even detailed exactly what was wrong (some issue with degradation of the disk synchronization you guys have between machines).  The response I receieved was 2 days late and not even legitimate.\n\nAlso, let's stay away from personal attacks?  I'm not watching porn on EWS, I'm using the autograding scripts our CS classes require, scripts not provided at all outside of EWS.  If I had another choice, I'd take it, but I have work to do and the way it stands I need EWS.  You directly insulted the department, saying that we obviously don't have any idea what we're doing, and that we're all useless. Well, that hurt. Hence why I had to point out all the stupidity you just spouted. Also, ~50 boxes run by 4 people is nothing compared to 1500+ boxes (counting faculty machines, lab machines, and everything in between) as well as a massive, aging server infrastructure run by maybe 20 full time staff and 60 student workers, most of whom provide L1 support, if that. You're expecting us to operate like a department with 5x the funding we have.\n\nEdit: large network of staff, my ass. Twenty full-timers on 1500 boxes is not a bad ratio.  I never said you guys were all useless, because if you were, I wouldn't be complaining about the downtime of the service in the first place.  All I'm saying is that EWS needs better support and outage response.  The headline image was not intended to offend, it was intended to make people laugh after being frustrated that they were losing hours during finals week.  Judging from the response it got in private forums other than /r/UIUC, it was pretty effective in doing so... I'm really sorry people here seem to take it so personally and mean you no offense. Twenty full timers to 1500 boxes is 75 computers PER PERSON, assuming every person in ENGRIT works directly with user support (which is not the case-we have 2 guys that serve as our Windows and Linux admins, as well as 3 or 4 people that handle infrastructure specifically). Now, this might still not be a problem if not for the fact that, no offense, but many (I don't want to say most, but most) of our users are absolutely useless with computers, and that goes for a lot of the profs as well. We need at least double the staff we have now, and triple would be even better to fully manage our entire network. In institutional IT, 75 boxes per person is not an unmanageable load.  I think the problem comes when many of the people working for EWS are consumed by low-level end-user support, increasing the number of boxes/sysadmin.  How does EWS handle \"I restarted my computer and can't figure out how to get into Linux\" type requests differently from a \"it seems your distributed filesystem is crashing and burning, here are some access logs and a timestamp\" support requests?  And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Go to [this page](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/) and check the stuff on the right. It tells you how many computers are being used in what labs. I know about that page, but I don't think it updates frequently enough, because at MEL, Grainger, Eng. Hall and DCL there were literally zero computers open when I got there that day. Still, EWS needs more computers regardless And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Depending on what you need, you might be able to remote in. Check out your options [here](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections). I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha Just making sure. It's crazy how many people don't know their options.  Remote desktop is really convenient if you need to get something off your EWS drive or something like that , but I wish it was fast enough to do the heavy stuff. And if it had MS Office that would be useful. It's still nice that they offer it though I agree that sometimes it isn't the fastest, but it seems that NX client is good enough for most of my linux needs. As for the Windows machines, I think they have MS Office. Linux doesn't have it for obvious reasons.  MS Office isn't offered on Citrix mainly because its too expensive, but every windows lab has it, yes.  MS Office isn't offered on Citrix mainly because its too expensive, but every windows lab has it, yes.  Yes it is....? I just logged in and I could use it no problem. ESCs have access to MS Office, everyone else doesn't. I thought my roommate was crazy until he showed me he didn't have it. Then someone from windows admin told me they can't offer it to everyone because of the cost of licensing.  I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha Revit and Inventor are both available over Citrix. Because of the way citrix works, its actually quite fast. All the computations are actually done server side, and it just sends you a graphical interface. This means its just as fast as actually using one of the computers in the labs. \n\nEdit: To be clear, this is not how NX works, and why its generally slower than using the computers in the labs.  I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha You can get most autodesk software on your computer with their student edition software. That's where I got Inventor on my laptop.  You have to register yourself first.\n\nLink: http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=17355061 And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work.

WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  The worst is when people log in, lock the screen, then walk away to study elsewhere for an hour or two.  There were about 4 or 5 computers in that state in Grainger the other day. For future instances in which you see a computer like this, if the user has taken with them all of their stuff, leaving only the computer locked, feel free to take their spot. You can force a logout by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace on Linux workstations, or simply doing a hard reset on Windows machines. That's just it, they leave a single notebook or waterbottle.  Otherwise yes, I would have no qualms about logging them out.  They kept coming back every half hour or so. And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Most people are trending to reducing the amount of labs due to the birth of the mobile generation, UIUC might be doing the same, you should find out!\n\nSource: I manage all the public computing labs here at UIC and they want to reduce/cut our lab population (I run about 1800 machines). That's interesting. I would agree that for general computing labs that is a reasonable strategy, but for engineering workstations, which most people use (or should use) for heavy duty applications I would think the demand would not decrease due to mobile devices.\n\nThanks for the insight though, I would imagine the biggest constraint on capacity is cost  Is it just the Linux systems that are down? I sat in 057 Grainger for an hour before giving up. But then I went to the linux lab on the second floor of Everitt and it was working fine, but I want two monitors!!!!!!!!!!!  Is it just the Linux systems that are down? I sat in 057 Grainger for an hour before giving up. But then I went to the linux lab on the second floor of Everitt and it was working fine, but I want two monitors!!!!!!!!!!!  Given the symptoms that I observed (inability to log in and general lagginess), I'm guessing it was both Windows and Linux. There was a brief outage Sunday with similar symptoms that affected both Windows and Linux labs. I've been using one of the windows systems for a few hours and it seems to be working fine. Yeah, I was in 057 on Sunday and it was very frustrating. I emailed ews to ask why this happens and say it's really inconvenient. They said, \"The infrastructure team is aware of the server issues, and has been working on making it more reliable all semester.\" Hey, that was me! And they are! Sucks they still have problems, but honestly, it seems to be better than the last couple semesters.   It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Isn't Matlab free on the WebStore? Just download your own. Or is that subject to the same pool of licences?  It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Some of the Math and LAS labs have Matlab, right?\n\nEDIT: I just asked, G8B in FLB has Matlab. I think you have to have the software installed on a computer, but you also need a [license key](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/faculty_center/licensing.html) to use it, and the university has only a finite amount of these license keys. Many people are simultaneously using Matlab at this time, so it is difficult to get a license key and use it. You have to wait until someone closes their application and releases a license key.  It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Use GNU Octave? https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ No, I haven't, I've heard Octave is like Matlab but free - is that true? Is it as user-friendly (to install and to use) as Matlab? I'll be honest, I've never had a reason to use either. But one of the goals of the Octave project is to replicate MATLAB's functionality and make it easy for people to migrate, and from my understanding the differences are minimal. There are some small differences in syntax, but that's all I know off the top of my head. \n\nIf you're using Windows, here's a link to an installer:http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Windows#Octave-3.6.1-mingw_.2B_octaveforge_pkgs\n\nIf you're using Linux, it should be in your distros repos. So yum install octave, apt-get install octave, pacman -S octave, etc etc.  Thanks, I would have to install it in Linux. Do you know if it has the full functionality of Matlab, for example, does it have the different toolboxes?   Anddddd netfiles down for maintenance 3:30 till 9am. NPRE 402 exam at 8am. Guess I can't wing it by reading up lecture notes the night before. Just gonna wing it. Why are you still using Netfiles? It's gone in 9 days. Anddddd netfiles down for maintenance 3:30 till 9am.

TSG doesn't exist anymore, its all under Engineering IT now. There definitely seems to be an interesting relationship between the CS professors and IT, but I think its more complicated than you're making it out to be.  CS faculty hate EWS because CS wants its own IT department. And I mean, they have their own L2 support separate from EWS that has access to the ticket queue and whatnot because they've bitched about it enough. But it's really just CS faculty being whiny and wanting special treatment. ", "url": "http://i.imgur.com/wEGB2.gif", "id": 706, "title": "EWS down for 6+ hours during finals week.

What happens when you run out of eraser? How is the quality of the eraser? What size lead? 8)  I love my mechanical bic pencil, but this looks like a sharp pencil. Before this pencil I usually used pens or mediocre pencils like Papermate Sharpwriters.  If you're talking about those cheap plastic Bics that you can buy like 10 of for $5, I absolutely hate those.\n\nI bought this thing in March and I have not used a pen or any other pencil since.  Literally the only time I use a pen is when I have to (a signature or a check).\n\nThe pencil ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Kuru-Toga-Roulette-Model-Auto-Lead-Rotation-Mechanical-Pencil-0.5-mm-Gun-Metallic-Body/pd/6547)) uses 0.5mm lead.  There's a cheaper, all plastic version of the pencil called the Kuru Toga for about half the price.  The Roulette is the metal version.  I bought three packs of the recommended Uni-ball NanoDiamond lead from JetPens ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-NanoDia-Low-Wear-Pencil-Lead-0.5-mm-HB/pd/3742)), and the claims that they make are true.  I press hard when I write and this pencil's lead has broken less than a dozen times in the last *8 months*.  The eraser is small, but I just ended up ordering a high polymer eraser which I carry around with the pencil ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Boxy-Eraser-Black/pd/499)).\n\nAs for sharpness, I will repaste what I wrote in reply to a different comment:\n\n&gt;But the really unique feature of this pencil is the fact that every time you press down and then lift the pencil up again (such as in between letters), the pencil will rotate the lead about 15 degrees. It will constantly rotate the lead, making it stay perfectly sharp.  I'm sure you've written with a mechanical pencil before. You probably rotate the pencil in your hand every minute or so so avoid the flat side that forms after writing. The Kuru Toga gets rid of that problem and your lines are perfectly uniform without the need for you to rotate the pencil in your hand.\n\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSgh6SJuWTs)\n\nBuying this thing, in hindsight, was a very good decision.

I will definitely be ordering one of these ASAP!! \n\nActually, let me know if you order on from that website... Free shipping on orders over $25 The first time I ordered I got the pencil, 3 packs of that lead (should last you years), and that eraser, which was just over $25.\n\nKeep in mind that shipping can take up to 7 business days... in case you are going home for break early next week.

They automatically deduct a bunch for carpet shampooing (and it says so in your lease), but what pissed me off most was that they charged us for repainting when the walls in my unit were clearly fine. It was just something they wanted to do to the whole building even though not every unit needed it.

If it spins up and works you just need to buy a new enclosure which can be found for pretty cheap on the internet.  Is the hard drive still under warranty? The manufacturer should be able to help you out and save you some money. You *might* have to pay for shipping.  What brand is it, how old is it, and is it powering on or click,ing? If its a newer WD Passport, you're fucked since they use a proprietary ZIF connector inside. It's a Seagate FreeAgent.  It's about 3.5 years old.  And it's not powering up: no spinning disk noises, no light, not showing up on my computer.  It may just be a bad cable, but I'd like to just take it to an expert. wouldn't it make more sense to just replace the cable first? Sure, if I could find one that fits.  I bet a computer repair store might have one that they could test that with.  And if that's the problem, I bet I could buy it from them, too. If its three years old, its either USB-B, miniUSB, or microUSB. Post a pic and I can tell you which it is. All are very common.  It's not even powering up.  It's the power cable that may be bad.  [Computer Deli](http://www.computerdeli.com/) should be able to help you diagnose this problem\n\nIf they are unable to fix it and you REALLY need the data you can try [Drive Savers](http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/) but this is a pretty expensive service I think. I noticed Computer Deli with a Google search, but they didn't have any reviews.  You recommend them?\n\nDisk Savers seems like a pretty neat service.  I especially liked their Museum of Bizzare Disk-astours.  More the likely just a desktop SATA drive in there, I would try replacing the case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182155\n\nLess then $20.\n\nOr take the drive out of the enclosure and bring it by one of the campus departmental IT offices. They should have an adapter like the one sold with this adapter: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812232002\n\nThat way you know if the drive is bad or the case. It will take them less then two minutes to plug it in and see if the drive powers up.  You can go to the Tech Zone at the Union, I used to work there.

You're holding up a whole bus load of people!\"  After our luggage was stowed, he continued to yell at us about how inconsiderate we were and how we were banned from every using the service again.

They were obsessed with LEx when it was there, and they cannot let go of it even when it is gone.     As much as I hate Suburban because they're assholes, I swore I would never take Lex after last year. They were almost always late, sometimes by more than an hour, which was annoying. But not too awful. But the thing that finally made me say enough was the time I took a bus back to Champaign at night, and the headlights of the bus weren't working. At all. And yet we drove all the way back to Champaign in the pitch dark. Driving at night without headlights is illegal in Illinois. I'm quite surprised they weren't pulled over by state police, because they're mainly in charge of enforcing imminent mechanical vehicle regulations, just like anyone else can get pulled over and written up for a traffic violation for driving without headlights.\n\nThanks for the response, please get in touch! Since you've researched the matter, which states allow one to drive at night without headlights? I'm curious. I didn't mean to imply there were any states that do allow driving without headlights at night. But if you're that curious, you could probably start [here](http://www.dmv.org/il-illinois/safety-laws.php). It really depends on the vehicle code of the state you're in. It may not be specifically illegal depending on the cop/lawyer you're dealing with, but it's an easy way to be cited for reckless and dangerous driving and grant probable cause for a traffic stop anyways.

Are you asking for more? 1. The Illinois Student Senate created a special commission in the Fall to look into ways of improving the ISS Constitution (e.g. to make the student government more effective and representative). This question asks the Student Body to approve the commission's draft as adopted by ISS - as a referendum vote is the only way to change the student government Constitution.

The ISS is currently funded by the University's Office of Student Affairs, from general student fee money. The second question aims to replace this money with a direct student fee. This is intended to make the student government directly accountable to students and open up it's funding to review by the Student Fee Advisory Committee in the same way fees for McKinley, Krannert, and Assembly Hall are reviewed and require renewal periodically by referenda vote. At $1.00/semester, this would account for slightly less than a doubling of the ISS's funding, iirc. While this seems a bit extreme, the fee would require approval by SFAC, who have a history of severely cutting fees post-referendum. For example, Illini Media was granted $3.00/semester in last Spring's vote, but SFAC cut that to $1.85/semester.\n\nTLDR; 1) Approve the new, reformed Constitution for the student government, 2) move the student government to a funding system subject to review and periodic renewal by the students. a number of senators are idiots then. The original amendment was going to be \"Do you approve of the reorganization and existence of the student government through...\".  They wanted a direct mandate from the students (Since the current form of ISS sucks...)  One senator was worried that if it was rejected it would mean a dismantling of the senate and gutted the language.   I stand by my statement.

We have United States senators we elect to concern themselves with these issues. We have the ISS to deal with campus issues.  That depends, how many hundreds of dollars worth of cupcakes will this cost us all?    ~~What confuses me is how the sponsors chose to introduce this resolution. Had they submitted it the Sunday before the meeting, it would have been placed on the agenda **automatically** and would have been referred to a committee like any other resolution. Instead they decided to amend the agenda after the meeting began, forcing this awkward confrontation and the failed vote. I don't understand their thinking...~~\n\nThat being said, I have to side with the Treasurer on this one. If a student group wants the ISS's help to lobby their Congressional representatives, then that's fine - that's part of why ISS exists. But ISS shouldn't act as a means to condemn things \"as the Official Voice of the Student Body\", especially on issues where they lack the perspective to make a truly informed choice.\n\n**Update:** I was contacted by a source close to the matter shortly after posting. According to this source, the resolution was submitted prior to the Sunday deadline, but was not added to the agenda. After contacting another source close to the agenda setting process, I was informed that the submitted resolution lacked a sponsor, precluding its consideration and thus addition to the agenda. I'm not really sure what to conclude from all this, but that's the update. I've stricken the first paragraph of this post to mark the error, but I think it's still worth reading if you're interested in submitting a resolution to ISS at some future date. [deleted]   This is crap. Disband them immediately. CBoidy, I agree with you! How can the ISS exist if their constituents dont WANT them to exist? To be fair this comment was sarcastic. It would be by and large a waste of time to cover the topic.\n\nThat said, I still think they should be disbanded in favor of a more representative system. Though I cannot speak to the mechanism that would be at work in such a system. In order to be more representative, people have to care. How many students even know that ISS exists, let alone what it does?    There are Israeli students whose homes and families are affected by a nuclear Iran.  There are Iranian students who are affected by the Iranian regime and its human rights record.  Why shouldn't the ISS tackle this issue? By that logic, we should be condemning numerous countries because of their human rights issues, including Israel. We can't just pick and choose which countries to publicly condemn, especially if the whole student body does not agree with it.  ISS is a representative government, not a direct democracy.  In a representative government, the leaders decide what is best.   There are Israeli students whose homes and families are affected by a nuclear Iran.

I'm not surprised that ChairYeoman is defending the Student Senate as the ISS is paying him $1000+ to be the \"webmaster\" according to his flair.\n\nIt is important to understand what the original intent was of the ISS as we discuss its relevance today...10+ years ago the only purpose of the ISS was to lobby the academic/faculty senate on issues relating to the academic/university issues. There USED to be a \"Illinois Student Government\" which pretended they were government officials. The ISS of today is acting more like the ISG of yesterday, squandering thousands of dollars of senate dollars acquired through mandatory student fees and tuition.\n\nWe need to go back to the basics. The civic leadership situation is a prime example on how the ISS can genuinely serve a purpose...

It turns out I can pay only $&lt;insert amount&gt; for similar services from X. Could you please reduce my bill somehow? Otherwise, I would have to change service provider.\"\n\nAnd thats it - they would be happy to give you a better \"limited time\" deal. I know because I did it recently, and I am neither a student nor poor. You might have to repeat it after a year or so - their deals are always limited.

They are all part of a river system that was bought up in the 1960s with the intention of flooding it all to turn into a lake. There was a ton of push back from environmental groups, so it just ended up getting split up into these three parks, as no one agency could afford to run the whole thing. \n\nKickapoo - This is a cool area that is a reclamed strip mining site from the early 20th century. There are tons of small lakes that you can rent canoes on and paddles through some really clear water. They also can drop you up a few miles with canoes and tubes on a river that runs the length of all the parks. It's a nice park, but the busiest of the three. There are lots of small hiking trails here and it' worth checking out. There is also a frisbee golf course here.\n\nKennekuk County Park - This one has one big lake that has about a 7 mile loop that goes around it. It's a really nice hike that goes up and down through forests and parries, and with it being that long without many entrances, it's a good opportunity to get away and not have to see many people for a couple hourse. There are a few picnic tables and benches along the way so take a lunch. There are also mile markers so you know exactly how far you have to go.\n\nMiddle Fork Fish and Wildlife Area - This place has 35 miles of hiking trails looping through forests and grassland. Tons of day hikes available here, it's the farthest from CU at about 35 minute drive. You can get to Kickapoo in 25 minutes.\n\n\nThere are other things around, Lake Shelbyville is a little over and hour south. Clinton Lake has a nuclear reactor on it, and if you're looking for something really cool to do right now, get there in the early morning when the sun is just coming up. The lake is heated by the reactor, so there are fish flying all over catching insects that can still survive through winter, they dive through the steam rising off the water, it's a beautiful sight. There's also Turkey Run State Park over in Indiana, and Shades State Park in Indiana also, those are about 1.5 hours. Homer lake is alright, and probably the closest, it's 10 miles east of town and has about 20 miles of hiking trails.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions.

OK, I mean, my phone is already lost, and I didn't download those apps to it before it decided to get lost... so, can I still utilize any of those options?\n\nThanks again for all the responses. My phone may still be lost, but the help is making me feel a bit more hopeful. So, it's important that you answer a couple questions. Was it powered on? Was Mobile Data turned on? Was GPS turned on?\n\nIf your phone is on, and data is on, you can *remotely* install tracker apps, such as [this one.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&amp;hl=en) Just log in to the same google account you used for the phone's setup, and click install. From there, follow the app's instructions to locate your phone.\n\nLet me know if you get stuck anywhere. It was on, and I believe it's still on because when I call it, it still rings and doesn't go straight to voicemail. I think Mobile Data was turned on... and I'm not sure about GPS.\n\nI guess I don't know how to push apps. I'm trying but it doesn't seem to be working. \n\nTbh, the main problem I'm having is remembering the google account I created for the phone setup. I can't access it because I don't remember the username or password. Which is just dumb of me, I should have written it down somewhere, but didn't :( Here's a way to jolt your memory. Whenever you added a contact, it says the google account you're logged in under at the top. Do you remember what it was?\n\nAlso, do you have a gmail? Which email account did you read on your email app?\n\nHere's how pushing works. It's really simple! So, go to this page: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd\n\nand in the upper right corner, log in to your google account (that you definitely remember :) ), then click the little \"INSTALL\" button on the left next to the little droid guy. A \"Checkout\" dialog will pop up. Select your device from the dropdown menu (it'll be selected by default, assuming you don't have more than one android phone on this google account) then click \"INSTALL\" one more time.\n\nThe phone takes care of the rest! You'll receive emails about the phone to the email that you logged in with.\n\nAlso, for that particular app, here's a great tutorial about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gcTZbreowJM#! You are very thorough and helpful, thanks so much for trying. \n\nMy parents freaked out about the phone being lost and just deactivated it. My very old phone is now reactivated (not a smart phone). \n\nSo now I'm assuming nothing much can be done about finding it...\n\nU.S. Cellular reported it as missing in their records. \n\nI will continue trying to remember my gmail account information, just because. That's a good trick to try to trigger it. \n\nThank you again for all the help. I'm so sorry! I wish I could be more help, but I can't do much about that. I'm so sorry!

[Black Dog](http://www.facebook.com/BlackDogSmokeAndAleHouse) is a BBQ restaurant in Urbana that uses a lot of locally grown and raised products and prides themselves on that. It's a BBQ place so it's definitely possible to eat really unhealthy there, but you pick your own sides and the sauce comes on the side so it's also easy to eat healthy if you want to. As a bonus their beer menu is usually pretty good. Black Dog is my favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, and is in the running for my favorite anywhere. But I don't see how you can call it healthy. I honestly can't think of one meal that you could put together on their menu that would be \"healthy.\"\n\nI'm going to go ahead and keep on eating there anyway. You can get a beef brisket or pull pork platter at black dog with a sweet potato and veggies as your side. They put the BBQ sauce on the side so you aren't forced to smother your food in sauce. There's nothing that unhealthy about it.\n\nOrdering a pulled pork sandwich smothered in sauce with fries and pit beans on the side would be a way to make it unhealthy. Smoked meat is fairly unhealthy. Beef is fairly unhealthy. Pulled pork (pork shoulder or pork butt) is quite fatty and generally unhealthy. \n\nAs far as BBQ goes, what you're describing is healthy. But BBQ is not healthy. \n\nI'm going to keep eating there, regardless. There's nothing unhealthy about beef or fatty meat, really. Saturated fat isn't bad for one's health. That's plain inaccurate. The exact nature of the link is somewhat unclear, but saturated fat is generally considered among medical authorities to be unhealthy. \n\nAnd, unlike the lack of clarity on saturated fat, there's absolutely no debate about the fact that beef is bad for you. And that smoked meats are bad for you. That's not even in debate. \n\nBut hell, an accountant asserts otherwise. Smoking meats is a great way to add flavor without calories. I'd like to see you come up with a healthier way to cook chicken/turkey.\n\nThe sauces don't have to be unhealthy either. A pulled chicken platter with Carolina Vinegar (It's exactly what it sounds like. Apple Vinegar with dried ground peppers in it) would be a great way to go at Black Dog if you're tying to keep your caloric intake down. Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket is pretty awesome if you're concerned about protein though.\n\nOn the other hand, Ribs are TERRIBLE for you. 400 calories a piece and not much else. Yes, but the smoking process is also infusing the meat with carcinogens. That's plain inaccurate.

We went to the CPD today but they weren't very helpful as the guy in charge was out of office.  I'll be emailing him, but I was just wondering if anyone knew of any rules/laws my roommates and I should be aware of before throwing this? We've thrown huge parties for Unofficial before but they've always been indoors.  you will get boned if you have a single under 21 in there      I noticed you said kegS. Not sure how it works for a yard/outdoor party, but I know you're not allowed to have more than 1 keg at any indoor party. Last year CPD caught us getting 2 the day before, took one away, and gave us a $320 ticket. Double check to make sure how many you can have. How did that happen? Why didnt you tell them they were not going to the same location? Or if they showed up at your place, why did you answer and let them in? I guarantee they didn't have a warrant.  I put 1 keg under my name, my roommate put 1 keg under our neighbor's name (they had given us permission but were all at work for the night, and this was the Thursday before Unofficial). Cops saw us put 2 kegs in the car, followed us, then once we started bringing the second keg up they busted us, mainly because we didn't have our neighbor's keys on us so they were being put in the same apartment right away. \n\nRecommendation: take the time to go to multiple liquor stores and get 1 keg from each. Not only will you not get caught how we did, when the cops get the records of keg purchases there won't be two at the same location from each store.  Wow I can not believe that cops followed you to your house because you had kegs. That just fires me up but I know there's really nothing you could have done. It also really bothers me that cops have records to keg purchases. Is there no privacy or explicit rights on a college campus when it comes to drinking? Yeah it was pretty shitty, especially cuz at that point we knew they would have an eye on our place for any questionable activity all day. I'm not sure if there are normally privacy laws, but I know a lot of laws are 'changed' in a sense on Unofficial because of all of the injuries/alcohol poisoning/death that has happened in recent years. i.e. you can get multiple kegs legally with a permit, but said permit is not available for Unofficial. Also, supplying minors got bumped up from a standard ticket to a criminal misdemeanor last year.  You can have 2 kegs. You just need to get a permit at city hall for $25 bucks. They don't give that permit out for the day of unofficial. At least they didn't last year, because when I was getting the ticket I asked if there was anything we could have done and he told me about that permit but that they don't allow it on unofficial.   yeah id say best bet is to invite your 21 and over friends. Also try renting fences to control the inflow and outflow. Make sure you get your kegs a day or two early.

Just how tough is the class? Also both lectures are full right now. Will it be tough to get a spot or will a ton of people drop after the first couple of lectures? Thanks for the help guys!  I was in the same position last semester, however I talked to someone in the department and many people dropped the first week. \n\nAs for difficulty, it will be much harder if you have no programming experience. You will have to do the readings and the TuringsCraft assignments (That is important they will teach you the semantics or programming which is not covered in class). However Angrave is one of the best teachers on campus he gives you weeks of extra time to complete MPs, and then regrades them all at the end of the semester. Also pretty much everyone gets 10% boosts on all the exams. I think it's important to note that it will be much harder with no experience because it's an intro class. If you already know Java, it'll be super easy because it's just basic Java. Kind of like how Calc 1 will be super easy if you have already taken calculus classes. It will be easier if you know how to code, but the class is run assuming you have never written any code in your life. OP should certainly not be discouraged by having no coding experience.   If you're willing to put in the effort, you'll do fine.  It's a great class and a ton of people enjoy it.\n\nI'd imagine people will drop after the first week or so.  Just show up to the class and keep checking over the next few weeks because a spot will inevitably open up. That's what I figured, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't getting in over my head. Thanks a bunch! Just wanted to add, make sure you have enough free time. Programming can take up a lot of time; I didn't take CS 125, but ECE 190 MPs (machine programs) were tough to get through at that moment. Don't overload yourself because you may end up involuntarily hating programming.\n\nAlso, if after the few days no spot opens up, try emailing the teacher saying how you're a Freshie Undeclared and you're extremely interested in the CS curriculum and are really looking forward to getting an early taste of what that career path can offer. BS a little and I believe you'll get in.\n\nGood Luck!  I am a course assistant for CS125 this semester, and having taken it last semester, if you are willing to put in the effort, do the readings and practice writing code you will do fine. That being said, I highly recommend it, I am undecided as well but taking this course really helped me to find out what I am interested in.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask!

Well first off a mostly white school using a native american as a mascot is not exactly the wisest thing to do. \n\nAs to people not accepting a new mascot. The majority of students right now have never had the chief as a mascot. The new students would accept it. I disagree. I just complete my first semester at the U of I and it barely took any time to notice how much love our student body still has for the Chief. It didn't take me long to catch on, and it would be difficult, even awkward, to have a different mascot.  Racial sensitivity, especially given the gruesome history of treatment of Native Americans, is more important than awkwardness over a new mascot. \n\nNew mascot being awkward, and difficulty adjusting to it: First world problem. Oh fuck off nobody means it to be insenstive to the mistreatment of Native Americans. \nIf we really care about the Native Americans why dont we give their land back?\n Because they are, kind of, dead? A mascot shouldn't be a mascot even if *some* people have a problem with it, especially if they find it offensive (as opposed to merely lame/dumb/uninteresting). It is meant to unite all students, not divide them. It divides even people who aren't Native Americans, because they either take a stand against it, for it, or are indifferent - thus dividing them into three distinct groups. I dont think all Native Americans are dead. Also, it seems that even though the chief may not longer be our mascot he is till uniting the student body, i.e chanting his name at games, this thread, etc.\n\nI feel that there are more over politically correct white kids offended by this, than actual natives.  Still uniting the student body? Whenever the 'chief' comes up, a massive emotional argument seems to break out. Some unity. How is it offensive to native Americans even? I have seen the Chief dance at a game. The Chief is dressed in traditional gear and performs a war dance, which is essentially cavorting around on the field during half-time, as a source of amusement and entertainment for the audience, in the same way as cheerleaders.\n\nIf you are white, how would you feel if a caricature of a respected figure of your race, say Abraham Lincoln, was made to cavort around on a football field for the amusement of college students, with the audience loudly cheering? If you are black, how would you feel if  a caricature of Martin Luther King Jr. were to be used the same way? And bear in mind that since there aren't many Native Americans around, as compared to whites or blacks, for many people the Chief is probably their only image/idea/impression of Native American tribes - these weirdly dressed people who dance funny. And these are comparisons without even going into the genocide issue, which makes it all the more disrespectful.

I heard this rumor from people that worked at NCSA (National Center for Supercomputer Applications). \n\nIt seems plausible, to me at least, because I can't understand why would so many computer labs and infrastructure are in a foreign language building basement? Online education for languages doesn't seem to be that old, at least not older than the labs (although I don't know when they were made, does anyone know that?) and I have no idea if any foreign language classes make use of them. \n\nAlso, this university is one of the pioneers in supercomputing and research; we would have had the capability to make it during the cold war era, that's for sure. \n\nThe other reason that the rumor persists is because of the FLB itself. The architecture makes it looks really out of place compared to the other quad buildings. The central space inside the building is fully open, with the floors staggered, but that space doesn't seem to be the focal point of the building, no room to gather, no art, no features - its just a wide hallway. Most buildings that have a huge indoor space (like the Union ballrooms or BIF for example) use that space to gather - for FLB you really can't (its hard to walk in that hall between classes). \n\nMaybe I'm just bullshitting, but that rumor has always crossed my mind when I'm in there. Its fun to think about, that there could have been some secret computer that was doing something so awesome and dangerous it had to be hidden from everyone in the place that it would never be. A computer so powerful that that the Soviets would send a missile past the coasts, all the way to Urbana Illinois - AS AN ACT OF WAR, just to prevent US from using the data on that computer on them. Is fun to think that the US' secret weapon was lying just beneath some students trying to learn verb conjugation. I guess that's what I'll need to motivate me to go to class there in the mornings.

I myself didn't make it the first year and was a painting major for a year before applying again. GD also has a two-step system, where they look over your portfolio, and they also call you in for an interview. I think the interview format changes every year. Jennifer Gunji is the head of the department and she can be very intimidating, and she is very no-nonsense. Our program also tends to be more print design heavy, so don't expect too much in the way of UX or web design, thats something the department is still working on. You should also keep in mind you don't make a ton of money by doing design. I just graduated this past spring, so if you want to ask about the program you can pm me. I know theres also GD kids on this subreddit, so if you're really interested maybe you could make another post?  I'm on it now and I'm freaking out. I refuse to tell my parents because they'll kill me. I've been having panic attacks all day now - how are you dealing with it? Dude, just tell them. It's seriously not a big deal. You're in college now, this isn't high school. Shit's hard. Tell them it's hard and you'll do better. Plenty of people are put on probation, it's just a scary sounding word, all it means is they're going to watch you closely and make sure you do better. I was on probation for a semester, and still got into grad school and have quite a nice job now. It's nothing to lose sleep over. I'm on it now and I'm freaking out. I refuse to tell my parents because they'll kill me. I've been having panic attacks all day now - how are you dealing with it?

I've been having panic attacks all day now - how are you dealing with it? Lie  Hi, I switched from math to GD, so I've got a pretty good idea of how that works. I see your edit, so this is probably not relevant. But if you have any questions about the subject, feel free to reply / PM me, and also here's a mountain of text, that I wrote in another thread.\n\nI did that, exactly.\nThere is a lot more you should be aware of besides GPA. You will need to take an additional 4 years of school. Most, if not all, A+D majors have core classes that cannot be accelerated, as they are offered per semester and sequentially. So, once you are in A+D, you will have 4 more years, and since you couldn't get in until Fall of your Junior year, that would bring you to 6 years total. Make sure that you can afford to stay in school that long, and that mentally you can handle staying here that long without burning out.\nThe only exception to the 4 years is if you have taken proper analogous courses at a good school that can have their credits transferred. It doesn't matter how great you are at any subject, you will need to take those classes.\nBesides the portfolio, you may need to write an essay whose prompt you'll receive. You will very likely not need an interview right away.\nFirst year, you will do \"foundations.\" This is a year of intensive studio work focusing on hand drawing and also design, as well as lectures on art. Overall, this year is to broaden your artistic horizons and prepare you. Then, there is a very stressful process of applying to several majors. Yes, when you get into A+D, you will not have a major. You need to apply to one at the end of the year, using an updated portfolio, followed by an interview if they like it, followed by selection. Know that it is completely possible to not get into the major you want. So, if you only want one, and there aren't several you could be happy with, make sure you are very prepared and have a strong portfolio. I have seen several people get into nothing they want and end up dropping out, or burning a year and re-applying the next year. Graphic Design in particular is the hardest major to get into, and accepts few people. (To give you numbers, out of the 100 or so that get interviewed, 30 or so will get in.)\nAs for the Foundation year studios, you will be drawing. 3 hours straight, 2 days a week. Be sure that you can handle this sort of thing. It's okay if you can't draw well, but you need to be willing to draw that much, and that long. You might have to do things like draw the same chair, in charcoal, for 3 hours.\nBe aware of the financial costs, also. For graphic design, especially, you must have a Mac laptop. It doesn't have to be new, but it must be both a Mac and a laptop. I am not saying it needs to be that because they are better or anything, but you literally will not be allowed into class without a Mac brand laptop. I am 100% serious. If you don't have one, they're pretty expensive, ~1100 new.\nIf you have other questions, feel free to ask me. Think hard before you make that choice, but it can be a good one! Do they really not let you in without a mac? One of my former classmates has a ThinkPad (or had one the whole 4 years in undergrad), and no one ever told her she absolutely had to change. They'll probably push you to get one, but I doubt they wouldn't let you in the program without one. I'm 95% sure Ike is stretching the truth a bit considering that FAA has split labs. There may be pressure from peers, but that's going to be waning now that Macs are no longer \"cutting edge\" Do they really not let you in without a mac? One of my former classmates has a ThinkPad (or had one the whole 4 years in undergrad), and no one ever told her she absolutely had to change. They'll probably push you to get one, but I doubt they wouldn't let you in the program without one. I really didn't want to buy a mac, so I emailed Jennifer Gunji, who runs the GD program, about it. I asked if I could use my home computer, but she insisted I needed a laptop. (Definitely would be a hard major without a laptop.) When I asked if it had to be a mac, and couldn't it be something with equivalent specs, she insisted Mac, and ultimately told me I wouldn't be allowed into the first day of class without a Mac. Like, actually. \n\nThat said, plenty of the teachers are chill... you could probably get away with it, it's sort of up to your own discretion. But, that is Gunji's stance on the matter. However, I thoroughly feel that a PC would have absolutely been fine and I would have run into minimal or no troubles, especially considering the Adobe Suite is multi-platform.  I'm not in graphic design (I'm in ENG), but I can guess a few things you'll have to do:\n\n**Check the requirements to graduate from graphic design** to start taking graphic design classes (and other requirements needed for the degree) this semester (**EDIT: If you're accepted or approved**). Just because you are in a certain college, doesn't mean that you can't register for a course, unless the course is restricted ~~to you~~ (**EDIT: because you're not in FAA**). this means that -\n\n**You have to go to ~~LAS~~ FAA deans** to indicate that you are interested in graphic design so that you can possibly get overrides to register for major specific courses that you can't otherwise get into.

Hopefully you will get better advice than from me. You won't be able to transfer directly into Graphic Design.  Thanks for fixing that up. I didn't know that it takes such a long process to got into a major. I just know what it takes to get out of engineering with our too many problems. I think Graphic Design is an exception. When I switched from EE to MatSE it took 6 days after I did the paperwork. The reason that it wasn't that bad is because the majors are in the same college. I started in MechE and went to MatSE and it was no prob - the only thing you have to do is take the classes that the adviser in the major you're going into requires. When you switch colleges, its a lot more headaches because there's more paperwork, and even apps as neoblackdragon has alluded to.\n\n**EDIT:** Restricted classes too - especially in the case of this thread. You probably need someone's approval (dean or prof) for that, and that would be hell to do over winter break when you're not in that college. I think Graphic Design is an exception.

I am looking for interesting 'STEM classes', for lack of a better descriptor, to fill my schedule with. Were there any classes you've taken in your major that you've found to be really cool or worth taking? An example is something like MATH 347 that a lot of people credit with introducing them to proofs and 'real' math.\n\nAll my gen eds are done, all my major requirements are done and I have taken every obviously interesting undergrad class in my major (physics). If I can't find anything, I will take a grad physics class but I thought I might poke around the rest of the departments before I get stuffed into 'all-physics-all-the-time' for grad school.\n\nDon't worry about pre-reqs or what-have-you and please no 100- or 200- level courses.  ECE470. You learn the math behind robot arms. Prof. Bretl is amazing.  ECE470. You learn the math behind robot arms. Prof. Bretl is amazing.  Will look into it, thank you! Oh and you get to program a robot arm. So awesome. But I see your post about never touching C++, which is the language for the class.  The labs are the best part of the course (unless you love linear algebra *that* much). I even named my robot arm. I miss Fisto. lol...the path planning stuff was pretty cool too. Also the linear is super easy and wtf fisto? lol  Fallout new vegas reference.  If MATH 347 is the Real Analysis class, take it. Learning to write rigorous proofs is a useful skill to have in almost any quantitative discipline. I wish I had taken an analysis class at some point.\n I took MATH 347 (Intro to Proofs or some similar title) and MATH 444 (Real Analysis) and enjoyed both greatly, though the textbook for 444 was frustrating. Thanks for the rec though. You could always teach yourself real analysis if you've taken calc already. My suggestion would be to take some non-physics class that would be useful in grad school but you wouldn't have time to take in grad school / it wouldn't satisfy any course requirements / wouldn't be useful in preparing for quals / you would simply be expected to learn it by yourself. I am not sure what your concentration will be in grad school (experimental, theoretical, or computational), but a couple of general examples would be courses on programming or statistics. You could choose something other than these based on what your specialization will be in the future, so that you get a head start in grad school. Experimental condensed matter. I have taken a programming class in atomic simulation, can program in FORTRAN (and will not touch C++, Java, or Python ever) , and have also taken an excellent statistics class specifically for experimental physics. I took an extra year in undergrad almost specifically to take classes like that so I completely agree with your assessment. Those are usually the most common recs for physics grad students and they were very useful, but I have already done them and am struggling to come up with additional 'good to know's.  Math 412 - Graph Theory. Graph Theory can be used all over the place and almost all problems require a unique approach -- the proofs are never mechanical. It's a very fun course, though brutally fast.\n\nCS 398 (will be 233 in the Fall) - Computer Architecture. You start from the level of a simple logic gate and work your way up to designing a simple processor. I know you said no 200 level courses, but I feel like recommending this anyway. It's really cool to see the machinery behind everything. The ece version of cs 233 (ece 290) is more legit if you're actually interested in that stuff. \n\nOr take ece 411 #yolo ", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/15iazg/recommendation_request_favorite_upperlevel/", "id": 573, "title": "Recommendation request: Favorite upper-level science/engineering/math classes?

This may sound really absurd but, if you decide engineering is \"for you\", now would be the time to beast mode your networking skills. Meet everyone in all of your classes, form solid study groups (This is an important one!), and find solution manuals to all of your classes! I didn't really change my study habits (I studied usually by myself in my room) while trying to boost my GPA to get off probation, instead I just increased the intensity of my studying. This approach did not work so well. It took me a while to realize that college success is pretty dependent on studying efficiently, and that usually entails reaching out to people who are in the same classes as you. Engineering is HARD, and if you are struggling, chances are many others are too. Don't worry too much about being inadequate.There will always be some freak of nature smart people who take 18 hours of all technical courses and get straight A's. Don't feel intimidated by these kids, find them, and study with them. Once you get through the calcs, physics, and Tams (depending on what type of engineering you are), things get easier. \nBest of luck!\n Thanks, it really helps getting advice from someone who's been in a similar positon as me. I think improvement has a lot to do with maturing too, and getting out of that \"high school\" mode. College is a different scene and requires new levels of dedication. I'll definitely look into study groups and more networking. Much appreciated lastsemesterEng.

It is a large sealed event, so, as with booster draft, everyone starts on a level playing field.\n\nIf you decide to go to any events, just PM me and let me know, maybe we can meet up! I don't know if I'll go this week, but time will tell.\n\nTL;DR: Last week at this time I had no clue how to MTG, now I am going to a Pre-Release and have this collection in front of me (total of like $70 investment): [Link](http://imgur.com/fzabF).\n\n**Edit:** I went 2-6-1, and lost all 3 rounds, but it was fun, and most of the games were very close. It's Swiss format, so you play people with like-records. That sounds amazing. I don't come back to campus until the last day of break on the 13th, but I definitely want to check it out that week now (will they have it that week?). I haven't technically bought anything yet so I guess I'll go there early like you said and try to get a setup going.\n\nThanks! I'm 99% sure that every Friday they have FNM which is a draft + standard tourney. I don't imagine that it'll be any different next month :) How friendly are these to newish people?

I personally would recommend not taking all of the chem courses though. That's just me and what I learned from the past 3 years.  Building upon this, OP, if these are retakes, this means that you are having some difficulties with the material. Taking 102 through 105 at once means you wont have enough time to absorb the concepts presented from 102 or 104, especially because it takes time to do two labs at once.

I'm pretty low in the dumps. I don't even want to tell my parents because I was a pretty good student in high school I know I could of done better but I didn't focus on the right things my first semester here. \n\nEDIT: It's worth mentioning I'm premed (Bioengineering) so I know I need a 3.5 at least to be competitive for grad schools. I was hoping to have around a 3.5 my first semester here..Any advice is welcome.   First and foremost - The reason that you had trouble isn't because of your intelligence, if that were the case, you never would have gotten into this school, especially in bioengineering. The reason that you had trouble is because ITS HARD. If people tell you otherwise, either a) they had a great physics teacher in high school which taught them this stuff already, or b) they're saying \nBS to sound smart. Some people get things more quickly than others in classes like these, but it definitely aint a cakewalk. The college of engineering is one of the most difficult colleges in the country, and stuff like this is why. Your class sizes are huge, the material is fast, and in the case of the physics department, there's not much extra course materials to help you out. Its hard. You'll get used to it.\n\nSecond, life doesn't end when you're 19. If you keep making progress, eventually you'll reach your goal. Being a doctor is hard, but the challenges are finite.\n\nThird, I don't know that this applies to you, but I had a lot of difficulty throughout my time in ENG - I felt like everyone was better, more prepared, and could just buckle down when they needed to and finish their work, and I just couldn't. I knew something was wrong, and I went to the counseling center (a couple of separate stints) to try to get help for it. Eventually, I learned last year that I had a mild form of ADHD. I finally understand more about myself and I've been able to work with it and be more patient and forgiving with myself. Im definitely not going to diagnose you, but if you really feel that you're incapable of handing the work for some reason (known or unknown), use the resources in the U of I to help and learn how you work and how you are. Everybody in ENG has the intellect to succeed - the challenge is dealing with the emotional or organizational aspects of school.\n\nLastly, over my time in college, especially in a place like this, I leaned at least one thing - **college is an opportunity, nothing more.** Use every day to further yourself, because its no one else's responsibility anymore to make sure that you do. You're an adult, and you made a big investment in school that you'll have to pay for no matter how well you do. Just remember, you always have an opportunity to help yourself - you just have to be resourceful enough to find what you need to succeed and patient enough to see yourself through the process of improvement.\n\nA bit long winded, I know, but hopefully some of my words helped you out. Now go enjoy the break and come back strong! &gt; I felt like everyone was better, more prepared, and could just buckle down when they needed to and finish their work, and I just couldn't. I knew something was wrong, and I went to the counseling center (a couple of separate stints) to try to get help for it. Eventually, I learned last year that I had a mild form of ADHD. I finally understand more about myself and I've been able to work with it and be more patient and forgiving with myself. \n\nIf you don't mind sharing, can you say how exactly were you diagnosed? I too struggle with and get overwhelmed by simple tasks that other people find easy, like meeting deadlines, being punctual, time management, making plans and sticking to them, focusing on the task at hand and not getting distracted, keeping my place tidy and organized, etc. Most frustratingly, I run to the bus stop every day and still miss my bus. I feel these things are so easy for other people that it is almost second nature for them to be able to be on top of these things. I was diagnosed at the counseling center - I had an interview with one of the ADHD specialists and he realized that I had ADHD-NOS (Not otherwise specified). In my case at least, it means that I have mild severity now (as a child, I was way worse, but ADHD can go into remission as one gets older), but its still interferes with my functioning. Over the past year, I've been going to support groups for ADHD and procrastination at DRES and the counseling center and its helped me out a lot about adjusting my paradigms from \"Why does everyone else not have a problem with this?\" to \"I'm going to have to do this differently if I want to succeed.\" It was really satisfying, because I had a couple of stints at the counseling center previously for just more general counseling (one was more of a coach-type relationship), trying to figure out why I kept bottoming out and running in place. \n\nI'm no doctor, but if you do have concerns, you don't have anything to lose by going - although there is a waitlist for testing. Also, use Reddit as a resource - browse /r/ADHD to get idea of the challenges they face and see if you relate; trust me, its a good place - the mods there are the best - best reddit community I've seen by far. They have FAQ Friday, which is a thread where people ask questions and will get answered, most likely by a mod. You can post general threads on there too though. &gt; I'm no doctor, but if you do have concerns, you don't have anything to lose by going - although there is a waitlist for testing.\n\nIs this at the Counseling Center? Can I just call up and ask to be put on the waitlist, or do I need a referral from someone? Do you remember who you saw?

Should it be people from my classes?  Thanks! Sit in the front if you form them with kids you meet in class.\n\nStudy group with kids who sit in the front = good\n\nStudy group with kids who sit in the back = \"Hey man, have you done the HW yet? Can I copy off yours?\" As another student who would like to do better, with whom should I set up study groups?  Should it be people from my classes?  Thanks! Yes, form study groups with people from your classes so that you can discuss the material, do homeworks and MPs, and prepare for quizzes and exams together. Do this especially for the harder courses. Group study makes hard courses less stressful. It helped me stay motivated and interested instead of getting disillusioned by difficult course material. Try to find some smart and serious but nice and friendly study buddies in your early semesters, chances are that they will be taking a lot of the same courses as you during the later semesters too, so you can be study buddies with them for several semesters instead of hunting for new ones for every class. Thanks a ton!  I have a hard time making friends and actually talking to people, but I'll be trying as hard as possible to start getting some study buddies.  It makes sense that it would be far easier and better to have study buddies.  Again, thanks! Forming study groups is actually a good way to make friends, it is easier/less awkward to say \"Hey, did you get started on the homework yet? I am finding it hard, do you want to do it together? I am planning to work on it at 7 tonight at Grainger.\" than say \"Hey, wanna hang out?\"\n\nIf you have a hard time making friends you could make use of university resources to help you - UIUC has a lot of resources, you just have to find them and be willing to take the initiative to use them. For example, the Counseling Center organizes [Tuesday @ 7 Workshops](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/?page_id=72) to help people with common problems many college students face, and the first workshop of the next semester is on developing social confidence.     I don't know how helpful this will be for you, but there are student support services for people who have nonvisible disabilities. I'm already in graduate school and I have adult onset ADHD, which is technically a learning disability. I've been seeing counselors at McKinley for ADHD and social anxiety this whole semester, and it just got recommended to me to enroll with getting an academic coach and whatever else through this department. \n\nLink here: http://www.disability.illinois.edu/academic-support\n\nI was also a really bright high school student (and did not have ADHD at that time), but as I got older, my sense for motivation went out the window and I know that I suffered from social anxiety *immensely* as an undergrad. I don't know enough about you or your situation, but this might be a start. &gt; I have adult onset ADHD, which is technically a learning disability\n\nHow exactly did that get diagnosed?  I was told by a friend of mine who has bipolar disorder and severe ADHD that some of my everyday problems with doing one task at a time and doing it to completion sounded familiar. I went to a psychiatrist at McKinley and completed a diagnostic survey that confirmed for my doctor suspicions of ADHD. My version is not hyperactivity, but mostly attention deficit.  &gt; I went to a psychiatrist at McKinley and completed a diagnostic survey that confirmed for my doctor suspicions of ADHD.\n\nDo you just call up Dial-A-Nurse at McKinley and ask to be tested? Or do you need a referral from your primary care provider? \n\nIs the diagnostic survey a questionnaire? Is it like the quizzes you can find online? In that case why do you need to see a specialist, can't you diagnose yourself? I was told by a friend of mine who has bipolar disorder and severe ADHD that some of my everyday problems with doing one task at a time and doing it to completion sounded familiar. I went to a psychiatrist at McKinley and completed a diagnostic survey that confirmed for my doctor suspicions of ADHD. My version is not hyperactivity, but mostly attention deficit.  &gt; some of my everyday problems with doing one task at a time and doing it to completion sounded familiar.\n\nI struggle with time management and focus too (I think I struggle more than others, though I am sure everyone struggles to varying degrees and it is a normal distribution), but I sometimes wonder if it is a skill not yet learned/acquired properly or whether it is an intrinsic trait. Considering it an intrinsic trait is probably not helpful. I was a very focused student in high school and then my social anxiety took a huge dive as I got older as an undergraduate student. I was a high performing undergrad who knew how to study, but that has changed as I have gotten older. \n\nDRES will help students pick up the time management skills that are helpful for counteracting learning disabilities like ADHD (from what I understand), but for many people, it isn't helpful to think of learning disabilities as an inherent deficiency. Instead, it is better to think about ways of treating what can be observed as a real challenge to academic success and allowing that person to achieve more.  &gt; some of my everyday problems with doing one task at a time and doing it to completion sounded familiar.\n\nI struggle with time management and focus too (I think I struggle more than others, though I am sure everyone struggles to varying degrees and it is a normal distribution), but I sometimes wonder if it is a skill not yet learned/acquired properly or whether it is an intrinsic trait. In my case of ADHD, the biological traits have faded somewhat with time -but the behavior doesn't necessarily. I got diagnosed when I was 21, so for the first 21 years of my life, I had these traits and assumed they were just an odd part of my behavior an not related to anything - after all, I've only been me, so no one to compare it to. And also, everyone's behavior towards me was that they understood that I was just like that sometimes. So, If I think its just me, and and so does everyone else, the behaviors are conditioned and reinforced. Now Im seeing things in a new way at least and trying to understand my ability compared to everyone else's. &gt; In my case of ADHD, the biological traits have faded somewhat with time\n\nWhat do you mean by biological traits?\n\n&gt; So, If I think its just me, and and so does everyone else, the behaviors are conditioned and reinforced.\n\nYes, it has caused me interpersonal difficulties. I am really embarrassed that I am often late and often people think I don't respect their time, but nothing could be further from the truth. I usually end up apologizing profusely though I am never able to give a satisfactory explanation for consistently being late.            If you're getting a 2.5 GPA you aren't pre-med... Just sayin'\n\nYou can fix that GPA pretty quickly though since you're only a freshmen.\n\nAnyways you didn't really give that much info in the main topic. Why do you think you did poorly? I'm sure you could look back on the semester and figure out your main mistakes. \n\nBesides that I'd say AlmostGrad100's post is pretty awesome and you should check out /r/GetStudying  SDN's finest.... you know it. Got downvoted for being realistic gg Is being realistic a euphemism for douche? Just because you have a low GPA as a first semester freshman doesn't mean you can't be pre-med. Getting mostly A's or A-'s for the rest of his time here could significantly boost his GPA. Having a decent MCAT and around a 3.5 [makes him competitive.](https://www.aamc.org/download/270906/data/table24-mcatgpagridall0911.pdf) And if he's willing to go the DO route they honor grade replacement and the average GPA for applicants for DO schools is 3.41, which he could have by this time next year.\n\nOne bad semester will not ruin someone's goals in life. OP, if you read this, you can do it. It will take hard work but most of the people in this thread have good advice. Just remember your goals and use those as motivation to study hard and be sure to find people who can help you along your path.

So far I have a 1.3 GPA (I have bad test anxiety and I had medical issues.) and I'm wondering just how bad academic probation is and what happens while on it. I lost my scholarship, I'm scared, and I don't want to tell my parents. HELP!\n\nEDIT:Clearing up the medical issues thing: I had a sinus infection that was supposedly \"treated\" by McKinley (read: UNTREATED) that turned into strep throat which then turned into Mono (&lt; got treated by my doctor when I visited home). I was pretty sick for about a month.\nAlso was told that these are my precurved final grades, not my legit ones. I haven't even gotten the probation e-mail. Thank you for the help though!  As an eng student who has had his share of problems, I can tell you a few things. \n\nThe probation process works like this: at the beginning of a semester, you will be required to go to a probation meeting that the eng deans talk at. The meeting itself is useless, but what you have to do is talk to your deans often, especially if start out having more trouble next semester. Here's why: at the end of a semester that you're on probation, is that the eng deans will meet in a room and review every single person that was on probation. If you either a) have less than a 2.0 or b) got higher than a 2.0 and took a bunch of classes that don't count towards and requirement to graduate (like bowling), the deans look at what resources did you use to help yourself improve. Did you go to them for advising? Did you go to academic resources such as the counseling center or DRES? Did you get tutoring? Did you go to office hours? If you didn't, they won't have a record of it. And if they don't have any evidence that you tried to get better, the only logical conclusion they can make is that you didn't. And if they make that conclusion, then they remove you from the university. \n\nIf that happens, you must be out of the uni for at least 1 year. You can re-apply after that, as long as you have proof that what ever caused you to have poor performance has improved. This is better than the alternative - never kicking you out and letting your GPA slip into oblivion so that your GPA will never be a 2.0 no matter how hard you work, which is the requirement to get a degree from the U of I. \n\nIf yo are not removed, you're on super-secret probation. But you have another chance to fix things, so take advantage of it. If you get a 2.0 in this, you go back to regular standing.\n\nIf you need to take a semester off, then do so. Leaving voluntarily and coming back later is better than being kicked out. It also costs less.\n\nAnd most importantly, tell your parents. As an adult, you're now fully in charge of taking care of your education, but parents want to help kids with their struggles. Its more about the emotional aspect, because like I said, you're in adult in college - there really isn't much they can do anyway other than provide support for you. But if you don't want to tell your parents - ~~there's a probation letter coming in the mail. Tear it up before they see it.~~ \n\nIts long winded, but I hope this helps. Just take your mind off things and enjoy the holidays. Come back strong!\n\n**EDIT:** I was mistaken about how the probation letter was delivered. In previous years, it was sent by mail, but now it is an electronic letter that is sent by email to you. You must go to the My.ENGR portal and confirm it as it is one of the requirements of your probation I believe. Sorry for the worry and fretting this has caused during your holiday season.

They have some [self-help brochures](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/?page_id=7) on [academic difficulties](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/?page_id=106) on their webpage. They also provide [group therapy for anxiety](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/?page_id=38). Building upon this: OP, go to Disability Resource Educational Services (DRES). Go immediately when you get back to take care of test anxiety, because that is a hard issue to deal with. I know that they give extra time for exams there and they will work with your professors. I've worked with them, they have really helped me out in a lot of ways.  One thing no one has mentioned is the possibility of a retroactive withdrawal from some (or all of) your courses from this semester. I don't know if this is the best idea for you, but I'm just throwing it out there as another option.\n\nHere's what ODOS has to say about retroactive withdrawal:\n\n&gt;If a student wishes to withdraw from a class or semester after the final examinations and/or grade submission, they must file a petition within their respective college, provide proper documentation, and follow corresponding procedures. Students who drop below full-time (12 hours) need permission from a college dean. For more information, please contact your College.\n\nI don't know how this works for the College of Engineering, but here's what the form looks like for [LAS](http://www.las.illinois.edu/docs/students/forms/retroactive-withdrawal-allpages.pdf).   Clearing up the medical issues thing: I had a sinus infection that was supposedly \"treated\" by McKinley (read: UNTREATED) that turned into strep throat which then turned into Mono (&lt; got treated by my doctor when I visited home).

It really sucks your problem developed into strep and mono though. Good luck with everything.  Dude. Same fuckin thing happened to me with McKinley. I ended up withdrawing for a semester so as not to be in the situation you are in. FEw things I would say:\n\n1. Tell your parents. Be honest. They will be mad, but they will help.\n\n2. Ever heard of a retro-drop? If you can prove that you were distressed enough, you can retroactively drop a class. This can get rid of an \"f\" or two.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to lose engineering.

Any kind of information will be greatly appreciated.  This is one of the best physics programs in the country, especially in materials physics. Going hand in hand with that: it attracts some of the best students (from other states and outside the US) and the courses are not easy.\n\nIncidentally: we're looking for an undergrad in my lab. Which lab is that ? I'm really interested in materials .. Fascinated rather!  The best thing I see about the program is the huge number of free electives I'm asked to take!

If you're legitimately concerned with difficulty, then you shouldn't do it.  But if you really want it, then commit yourself to work as hard as you can without worrying about difficulty.  It depends on what your future plans are after finishing undergrad:\n\n* If you want to go to grad school, choose Physics. It will give you a solid background for research in physics and related areas like material science. The rigor and theoretical background of a physics program will be useful in any kind of research.\n\n* If you want to easily find a job, choose ECE. Many subjects like optics and E&amp;M are part of the ECE curriculum, and you will have to take the lower-level physics courses anyway to get an ECE degree, so if you like physics you will have plenty of opportunity to study physics.\n\n* Material science probably falls somewhere in between the above two.\n\nThere are not many major-related jobs in physics after a bachelor's degree. Getting an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering makes you an electrical engineer, but getting an undergraduate degree in physics doesn't make you a physicist - you need a PhD for that.\n\nI think that getting a bachelor's degree in a \"core\" field like Physics, Math, ECE, ME, CS is better than getting one in an applied field like Material Science, Industrial Engineering, etc., but that is solely my personal opinion (I think it is better to be a master of one field than jack of many at the undergraduate level). You can always branch out later. Many (maybe most) people end up working in a field different from their major anyway.  That is actually one of my majors in Engineering Physics with Material Science as well. You honestly have to be interested in physics in order to enjoy this class. The materials science portion of it is easy because there isn't a whole lot to get about materials, and I'm assuming you are doing materials because you like materials. For the PHYS courses themselves, you have to be ready to struggle though it unless you really get it. Phys 225 and 485, and well.. to be honest 325 all kicked my ass because I decided to skip a few classes and didn't attend the office hours. There is plenty of room to wiggle around with different Physics courses you would like.\n\nTL;DNR Don't skip classes and actually put in plenty of effort and you'll be \n\nedit: I can't word  I just got an A- in Phys 325.

Especially the things my math professors told me I wouldn't need to know.\n\nThe upper level physics classes will take a lot of time (I'm thinking 326 and 486 here). They are difficult and some of your homeworks will be several pages of math.\n\nIt can be enjoyable though. It's a great feeling when you finally get your head around a difficult concept and suddenly a bunch of other related stuff makes sense too.  It would help to know where you are transfering from to be a better judge of how difficult a time you might have.    I can see you don't know what physics is at U of I yet. Materials Science is not physics and not affiliated with our physics department. They work on similar stuff to what one branch of physics, condensed matter, does but the approach is different. Materials science is more about the applications and characterization of materials and physics is more nuts-and-blots \"why?\" using quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to investigate phenomena.\n\nEngineering physics is identical to the LAS specialized ('research track') physics is. You pay the same tuition as all the rest of physics undergrads and have one less required class than the LAS kids. So pick one or the other, there is no functional difference between them other than a few gen-eds.\n\nAlso, I am a little worried you're not really clear on what the hell physics is. Investigate it before you enroll, and not just asking a reddit forum what they think. I have seen people come on here and think it is some sort of higher form of engineering, which it is most certainly not. It is not a badge for smart people and no one gives a twirly fuck if you really love Brian Greene or Micho Kaku or wormholes because that is not what the majority of physics is. We lose over half of our freshman physics majors because a lot of them just have no idea what physics is other than it gives them an opportunity to jack their ego all over engineers. It is also hard. Being smart is not enough to make it in physics. You have to be incredibly tenacious because you WILL get the shit kicked out of you a few times before you leave if you're actually trying to learn anything. \n\nThat being said, good luck if this is what you want.

I have had more than one experience of other bike shops telling me \"that can't be fixed, here buy this bike instead\", but Bruce fixed the problem and at a reasonable price because it's \"the fun part of the job\". I think he likes the challenge. (And it's not that he fake-fixes it either, that one bike has been hit by a car while locked up, then again while I was on it, and both times fixed, and still riding really nice after 10 years of heavy use).\n\nI know that a lot of people just don't like his attitude or bluntness, but I don't mind it, and when I'm willing to humble myself and hang around for an afternoon, and just watch and ask questions, I've learned a lot about bikes and how they work. And, contradictory to what one would expect, he teaches pretty well - he's flat out said \"If I can teach you how to do this simple stuff, I don't have to do it, and when you come in it will most likely be one of the fun problems\".\n\nHe has changed since his stroke, some of the fire has gone away, and it's sad... 5 or 6 years ago it was a joy to watch him do the work - like watching any good craftsman when he gets in the zone.\n\nFortunately for the OP, there are several good alternatives in town. They are all a bit different in their target customer base and in their style. This means that you don't have to go to Bikeworks if you don't like it. Everyone has their preferences, getting angry about a bike shop you don't like is as silly as getting angry about pizza places you don't like.   I miss Bruce. He was a regular at the pinball machine at Murphy's in the late 90s when I was in school. True pinball wizard. He was there regularly in 06-08 too, but the stroke...saw him every now and then after that.  It basically comes down to he doesn't need the money to fix crappy bikes and he will tell you this... bluntly.   Seems about right; somebody actually interviewed him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L1m1QIFTtg It basically comes down to he doesn't need the money to fix crappy bikes and he will tell you this... bluntly.    I called him once and he asked me what type of bike I said. Dude literally started laughing and asked \"Did you buy this crap at walmart or something?\" When I told him I got at at sears he made fun of and said he wouldn't pay 20 dollars for my bike. I told him to screw off and went to Durst. They charge a lot but atleast they are nice guys. Durst will keep your bike for weeks without actually doing anything to it or telling you why.  That's not much better. Durst will keep your bike for weeks without actually doing anything to it or telling you why.  That's not much better.

I'm a sophomore in Civil Engineering who doesn't have much to put on a resume in terms of engineering experience. What do you think would make employers want to hire me for a first time internship, or something of the sort? Well, although it always suck to say this but without experience, GPA starts to become a heavier factor. Have a good GPA early on in college and more opportunities are available for you. \n\nBut if your GPA is average or below, then start to make your own experiences. Don't wait to get an official experience. There is nothing stopping you from starting a blog, learning an instrument, founding a club at school (note: take this stuff to the next level, don't just join a club, FOUND a club or be the PRESIDENT). All of these experiences can be twisted into an \"engineering\" experience because they all have complexities which can be solved using real-world experimenting. \n\nFor the blog as an example: \n\nThe absolute first problem every blogger encounters is:\nHow do you get people to read it? \n\nBam! Just by asking the question, you turn from dude who posts stuff to Problem Solver. \n\nSo, here is how to solve the problem:\n\n\nHypothesis: /r/insert_subredditname_here seems like my blog material. \nMaybe people here would like my stuff. \n\nTest: Post it on that subreddit\n\nResults: Did it work?\n\nWhen you can say you performed experiments with a blog and then explain your though process to a recruiter: either on your resume or in an interview, you show exactly how valuable YOU are, even when it fails completely. Recruiters eat this stuff up. \n\nSo, my advice. Get out there and start looking for experiences you can have which you can then put on your resume. \n\nOne caveat: Everybody hates the person who did something only for their resume so it is really important that it is something you genuinely are passionate about. That passion will come out and you will really enjoy your experience. Thank you, I really appreciate it. I have one last question. What do you consider an average GPA? I have a 3.15, so where would you rank that as a recruiter?  That is right about average.   What are some good websites to search for engineering internships? Most of the times I try to search, I end up on webpages looking for fulltime positions.  I must point out these people on campus: ECS\nhttp://engineering.illinois.edu/current-students/career-services\n\nThey helped immensely with my job search, advice, and so on. They would be an excellent supplement to these good people's AMA. Best part: mock interviews! These are excellent practice and help build confidence.  Engineering will be my second bachelor's degree.  I've never used my first degree to get a job, but could the fact that I have it make me overqualified for internships and entry-level engineering jobs?  If so, what can I do to mitigate that problem?  [deleted]  I'm in Aerospace engineering and am a sophomore. I'll probably have around a 3.18 or 3.19 GPA after this semester. Is there any chance whatsoever of finding a job? I know some people here scoff at questions like that but I've had people tell me that without a 3.5 there is no point in applying and I've had others tell me that graduating from here with an engineering degree is fine.\n\nI should point out I haven't put in any real work in college yet (I obviously can't tell recruiters this upfront) and that I plan on getting my crap together but I know courses are going to get significantly harder soon.\n\nBasically my question is am I freaking out about jobs for no reason or am I really screwed?\n\nAlso I've been told the job market for Aerospace engineers isn't to hot right now. Do you know anything about that?\n\nLastly I have a question about useful skills. I speak spanish decently well and arabic pretty well. Are these things that interest any engineering companies even a little? Is putting the fact that I'm getting an Arabic studies minor worth it on my resume?  Yeah. You are freaking out for no good reason. Having a 3.5 is nice and doors will be easily opened for you. But a 3.18 is pretty average. And average people do get jobs. All you have to do is show you are above average and you will have as many opportunities.\n\nI don't know much about the aerospace engineering market (I'm a Chemical). But, the beauty about engineering, you can do anything and the recruiters hiring you (engineers themselves) know this too.\n\nAs for languages/skills, these are the spice that make you a person rather than applicant #23. And who knows, the head recruiter may even know Arabic - making you instantly memorable. So, yes, definitely put these things on your resume. The funny thing about GPA's is, once you get some good experience, companies don't care about it anymore. 3.18 is a great GPA, especially at a premier engineering university. I have slightly above that, and I was able to get an internship last summer and subsequently a job offer because I had worked on campus in IT help the summer before. That experience definitely caught their eye and matters way more than some number.\n\nSimilarly, one of my friends got a job this past fall, and his GPA is lower than 3.18 and lower than the minimum required GPA for his employer. Upon seeing that he goes to U of I, however, they said it didn't matter, because they knew how tough of a curriculum this is. He also had worked a research job with a professor on campus this summer.\n\nIt's all about getting job experience.  What are the pros and cons are of working/having a job?  Do you recommend that students list courses on their resume? I have a couple of summers of internship experience as well as a technical job on campus, but some companies still advise me to list courses that I am taking/have taken instead of that experience.  I would think that the work experience from internships would get priority but another perspective would be nice.

This is just for next semester. It's going back to 19 next year. Why would they do that? Why would they do that? If a bar gets too many citations for minors drinking in their establishment they can get put on probation.  Then if theres still trouble with minors there the police can shut it down for good. So Kams probably got in some trouble for having too many minors there and are making it 21+ until they're off probation.  Same thing happened to Fire Station last year and I'm pretty sure  it had a major role in it being shut down. Why would they do that?

So their policy is, all passengers must carry a physical print-out of the ticket issued by them on their website during the time of boarding. I can bring myself to understand this with a bit of skepticism regarding their archaic system (as opposed to LEX who simply gives the bus driver a list of passengers and checks for ID).\n\nThe following happened to my girlfriend. We were boarding a 4:30 a.m. bus on the south side of ISR, we got there 15min early, and she had forgotten her physical copy of the ticket. They directed her to go to ISR in order to print it out, even though she has no access to the building. While she waited at the door for someone to be on the way out, 2 more people showed up with similar problems. Except one person had a print out of the screenshot of the ticket, which they refused as a proof of ticket. After the person bitched and moaned, they decided to check his confirmation e-mail as proof, and let him on the bus. Apparently they couldn't do it for my girlfriend and the other guy. While my girlfriend is inside ISR printing out her ticket, they decided 5min past 4:30 a.m. is too much to wait for, they left.\n\nNow, they haven't violated any of their policies, I agree, except maybe the guy who had an incorrect print out of the ticket. But really, 5 minutes? And really, you can do something special for one person and not for 2 more? who obviously purchased a ticket? I am very disappointed in their customer service and overall attitude towards their customers.\n\nAm I just biased in this situation because my girlfriend got shafted? Is this a common theme in Suburban Express customer service? Please share if you have any insights.     Is their policy clearly stated? Yes. \n\nIs it archaic? Does it COMPLETELY screw over a lot of people who forgot tickets or were unable to print them? Absolutely. \n\nI too have had to watch a Suburban Express bus pull away because a screenshot wasn't enough even though I had clearly purchased one!   Guys, I would recommend looking at Amtrak. In the past the tickets were always $35+, but this past year, $14 ones are popping up from Champaign to Chicago.  You can usually get tickets for ~$14 if you buy them early enough (and you can be a little flexible with your departing time). If you wait until last minute, you're probably going to pay $35. \n\nI travel back home often and typically pay $28 round trip. \n\nEDIT: I usually head home Thursday night, and head back Sunday morning. My ticket has always been $14 dollars for the 6:49 PM train home and 8:25 AM train back on Sunday. \n\nI just checked the website, next Friday there are tickets (I know this doesn't help because most people want to be home for the holidays but I'm using it as an example) available for the ~6:00 PM train at $14. Two weeks from that there are tickets for $26 and $14. \n\nAlso, most - if not all - of the buses will take you to the terminal. \n Guys, I would recommend looking at Amtrak. In the past the tickets were always $35+, but this past year, $14 ones are popping up from Champaign to Chicago.  I considered Amtrak, the only issues is that you need an additional hour to go from the Union Station to whatever station it is that's close to O'Hare =( I don't even care. Even though I'll have to spend an extra hour or two, and the trip is costing me more (I was supposed to have a ride up originally, so the ticket purchase was last-minute), I'm still taking Amtrak + Metra to get home for break, because the whole experience is better. The comfy seats, leg room, tray tables, more room for carry-ons, snack car, and no need to worry about a bad driver. I don't even care.

I feel they make it pretty clear but every time I ride one of their busses there is someone that shows up without a ticket! Like I said, their policy was clearly stated, and I respect it if they follow through, but I didn't feel comfortable with their special treatment on that one guy.\n\nI also think LEX did spoil a lot of people into thinking they don't need any preparation prior to boarding the bus, but at the same time it's also a convenience they could perhaps look into implementing? Now that LEX is gone, I am sure they can invest some money from their newly regained monopoly into something similar.    [deleted] Any reason you guys choose to publicly shame people who have not paid? \n\nInstead of attacks on other bus companies wouldn't your marketing be better spend trying to show what is good about your company?\n\nAnd I've never been on a  bus that was on time/arrived before the time stated, would it not be better to just change the times on arrival instead of being late every time?(The bus driver complain you guys don't allow time for disembarking when considering the times) \n\n [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] &gt;As another poster noted, paper tickets are the basis for our extremely efficient boarding system. We would never be able to get hundreds of people on buses quickly if we messed around with lists, ID's, and garbage like that. \n\nI'm sorry, but this is bullshit. Checking a name on a list does *not* take significantly longer than checking a ticket. And you could shorten it further by checking only those who have forgotten their tickets. One small change, and suddenly you can make 99.9% happy instead of 99.5%. And before you say that this will lead to everyone \"forgetting\" their ticket and significantly lengthening loading times: Charge a \"lost ticket fee\" for anyone who shows up without a ticket and has to have their name looked up. Warn them about that fee four times throughout the purchase, just as you do about the current ticket policy.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I think your ticket policy really is fair; I just think that a few small changes could make *everyone* happy for a *very* small amount of additional effort.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to bring up the apparent policy of banning anyone who posts complaints about Suburban Express. I'm not saying that *is* what happens, but I have no choice but to believe it until I hear a better explanation. Believe it or not, *customer complaints are good for you*. A complaining customer, especially one who complains directly to you first, is *trying to tell you how to make it right*, not trying to slander your company name. Quite frankly, banning complainers harms you far more than Internet complaints could ever do.\n\nOh, and the following isn't directed at you, but to others who might be reading this comment:\n\n###DO NOT DOWNVOTE SUBURBANEXPRESS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SUBURBANEXPRESS.

So far, all I can find are some non-starter Myth/Fact blurbs on https://www-s.odos.uiuc.edu/care/\n\nA good start may be to bring up that the [CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS)](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/) suggests that in 2010 approximately 44% of rapes committed against a partner of the opposite sex were committed by women against men. If popular opinion is that your program is sexist, opening like this would knock that right out.\n\nAnother area to tackle might be in the definition of rape itself. It wasn't until this year, 2012, that the federal definition of rape even [allowed for the possibility of a male victim](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html). Many young men may not even realize that they've been raped, let alone know how to handle such a situation or who to approach to talk about it.

I read through that section and couldn't find the statistic you pointed out. Maybe I read past it.\n\nYou didn't read past it. It isn't reported, because the definitions of rape used in the NISVS report aren't consistent between men and women, which affects the reported numbers. The NISVS report was conducted before the new male-inclusive federal definition.\n\nI spend time over in /r/MensRights, which sees a lot of analysis of statistics like these. One user [broke down the NISVS report](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/143skb/2010_cdc_survey_on_sexual_violence_shows_that/) in such a way that accounts for the discrepancy in definitions, and arrived at the 44% statistic. I ran through his numbers on my side and couldn't find any glaring errors, though his commentary is a little hyperbolic.\n\nBear in mind that this is a statistic for rapes reported in the year prior to the study, before the new federal definition went into effect, so the user is potentially extrapolating incorrectly. We'll have to give it a couple more years before we can do an apples-to-apples comparison between men and women, if only to account for the revised definition. Until then, *any* nontrivial extrapolation is worth discussion, and this is one.\n\n&gt; A good chunk of the workshop is defining rape, and pointing out that the term is gender-neutral. We talk through a few different scenarios that involve male victims and how they should be treated no differently from female victims (i.e. their concerns shouldn't be blown off because \"dudes love sex brahhh\") and what they can do about it.\n\nAwesome. Keep it up. :) Maybe you could point to some materials that support what you're saying. So far, all I can find are some non-starter Myth/Fact blurbs on https://www-s.odos.uiuc.edu/care/\n\nA good start may be to bring up that the [CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS)](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/) suggests that in 2010 approximately 44% of rapes committed against a partner of the opposite sex were committed by women against men. If popular opinion is that your program is sexist, opening like this would knock that right out.\n\nAnother area to tackle might be in the definition of rape itself. It wasn't until this year, 2012, that the federal definition of rape even [allowed for the possibility of a male victim](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html). Many young men may not even realize that they've been raped, let alone know how to handle such a situation or who to approach to talk about it. Can a woman really rape a man? Men are physically stronger. And how can it be done without the man's cooperation/willingness?  Yes. Some women are strong...some women coerce men into having \"sex\" (\"sex\" that involves coercion is assault)...some women may use drugs/alcohol to incapacitate a man...there are many ways of getting around a man's (potential) physical strength. Yes. Some women are strong...some women coerce men into having \"sex\" (\"sex\" that involves coercion is assault)...some women may use drugs/alcohol to incapacitate a man...there are many ways of getting around a man's (potential) physical strength. Still, how can it be done without the man's cooperation and willingness? A man can have sex with an unwilling woman, but a woman cannot possibly have forced sex with an unwilling man.\n\n&gt; some women coerce men into having sex\n\nYou mean they seduce them? That is different from rape. Erections are not voluntary actions.\n\nIf a woman's vagina gets wet while she's being raped, does that mean it's not rape?\n\nIf a man or a woman orgasm during a rape, does that mean it wasn't rape?\n\nErection does not equal consent. \n\nYou also seem a little hazy on the definitions of coercion and blackmail and how they relate to rape. &gt; You also seem a little hazy on the definitions of coercion and blackmail and how they relate to rape.\n\nI am no expert on these matters, but on a layman-level, I understand rape is different from coercion and blackmail with regard to the degree of control available to the victim. In rape, the victim is physically overpowered or is drunk/drugged or is kidnapped and has no chance of avoiding being sexually violated. The victim does not give consent, it isn't asked for, and no cooperation of the victim is needed. Rape happens when there is penetration, without that it is sexual assault. \n\nWhen I think of coercion, I think of sexual harassment - for example, an employee being asked to provide sexual favors to their boss or risk getting fired. They are still giving consent, though under duress. They could not give consent and get fired, and be unable to make ends meet, and that might be a very high price to pay depending on their circumstances, and capitulating to the demands for favors might be easier. \n\nWhen I think of blackmail, I think of sexual favors as a price for keeping an embarrassing secret or keeping some information about the victim private. There is still some choice there, the victim gives consent under duress, because the shame of the information in question becoming public might be too much for them to bear.\n\nI am not saying the above two circumstances are good or acceptable or are not abusive or are not traumatic for the victim, but calling these situations rape diminishes \"real rape\", in which the victim is completely powerless and cannot get away. If you include the above two situations in rape, it seems to me that that will dilute the definition of rape. \n\nEDIT: Going by the numerous downvotes I got for my comments in this thread, I suppose these are all rape, just different degrees of rape.

Obviously, I can't speak from personal experience but that's just what I've been told.\n\nIf you truly don't want to have sex, but you feel like your hand is forced to because someone else wants it and won't drop the idea at all, it is still rape. &gt; use drugs like Viagra to make a man get an erection\n\nIs that true?

[0:28] Not super surprising. Unless they're very americanized, a Chinese party would mostly be a get together at someone's house or apartment. The International Chinese students tend to stick together so you wouldn't exactly be invited to their parties.  Yeah. I made really good friends with the LLMs at the law school, so in between inviting them to my cookouts and vice versa to their hotpots, we had a lot of fun.  Although it was kind of odd, I enjoyed this video. [deleted] Roughly half of this was filmed in Urbana. Why is only Champaign getting a plug? In Chinese UIUC is just referred to as University of Illinois Champaign. I don't think there's a chinese equivalent for Urbana.  You mean there is a Chinese \"equivalent\" for Champaign, a proper noun?  Roughly half of this was filmed in Urbana. Why is only Champaign getting a plug? [deleted]    I'm confused...is this supposed to be a joke or is it supposed to be serious? If I had to guess, the university commissioned it in order to get more Chinese students to come here... The fact that it looks like a joke is because Chinese culture is ridiculously different from ours, it would seem. I could be wrong on both counts, though. I'm just white and in-state.   to be honest lots of chinese students here are annoying. to be honest lots of chinese students here are annoying. I've never had problems with Chinese students. South Koreans on the other hand . . . to be honest lots of chinese students here are annoying. to be honest lots of chinese students here are annoying. Not really. But they are probably not the fun people to hang out with. They will consistently show off their achievements ( perfect gpa in university and awards they received back in china) .sometimes hangout with Chinese students make me feel that I am a loser. Hanging out with Taiwanese or Singapore  students is probably a more pleasant experience because they seem to understand our culture better.  Why does hanging out with Chinese students make you feel like a loser? Is it solely because of their (real or perceived) academic achievement? And if so, why do you feel that associating with your perceived academic superiors is a limit to friendship? Surely they, too, have feelings, including feelings of inadequacy (such as not understanding why Americans dislike them) ? When you have a friend keep bragging himself, you will understand how does Polk6565 feel... Are all 6,000 or whatever Chinese students braggarts? I don't like braggarts either, but I suspect that a nonzero number of the Chinese students here are perfectly cool people who would love to make American friends, and would not be all \"Bro, not only did I get a 100% on an exam the other day, but I also won the Nobel Prize in everything, Medicine, Chemistry, Physics and Peace.\"  Soon there will be a Chinatown on campus...

Some myths can be dispelled pretty easily, but there are some things I'd really like the police to answer. \n\n1. Champaign compiles those stats in January every year, but records show it's been between 1,000-1,200 each year since 2008, when they cut down on patrols doing the barchecks instead (more on that later).

There's no full-time staff with the Champaign Police that runs the bar raids. Now whether it's wise for them to spend overtime hours on raiding the bars and making around $16 for the city for every $1 they spend rather than patrolling the areas that have seen more crime recently... is kind of a loaded question, but it could be a valid one. The first thing you would want to know is how many overtime hours are spent on extra patrols.\n*Campus police don't directly participate in bar raids*, but the Illinois State Police will often join in.\n\n5.

Remember two years ago http://studentactivism.net/2009/05/05/pre-finals-drug-bust/\nwhen the cops had a whole year-long investigation ($$$) into drugs on campus - and after that enormous investigation they ended up arresting around a dozen kids for pipes, small amount of weed, etc...\n\n\"to protect and serve....\" psh Ermagawd I broke the law and am complaining when caught.   If you legitimately want a CU police officer to do an AMA, you probably shouldn't dive into it assuming you know more about what cops 'focus on' because of the occasional bar raid you see. I think it's okay for OP to state his viewpoint/opinion/impression. If someone from Campus Police does an AMA they can correct OP. It is customary for AMA requests on /r/IAmA to contain 5 questions, so I don't see any problem with OP asking questions based on his experience. Perhaps, but I don't see the incentive for a CU officer to participate if from the get-go they'd be asked question based on false premises. As NikaRiots posted below underage drinking is by no means the focus of the police.

I think its the state police that drive the paddy wagon and bust bars. Also, considering the poverty rate is higher here then in Chicago I'm surprised more shit doesn't happen. I never see cars patrolling campus at night so I assume they stay further north.   I can tell you this much - not nearly all muggings make it into crime reports. \n\nExample 1 - Three friends of mine were robbed at gunpoint last year a block from county. It was reported to the police and showed on the DI blotter, but no crime alert.\n\nExample 2 - My friend was mugged 2 years ago  in Urbana (a few blocks East of Mckinley, past Lincoln). It made it into the blotter, but no crime report.\n\n**tl;dr: there are a lot more muggins and such happening on campus, they just don't all become crime alerts**  Yeah they need to focus on more serious stuff rather than penalizing harmless people. I got a ticket for riding a bike on a sidewalk (though it was Urbana Police), and I didn't even know I was breaking some rule. $100 ticket, no warning or lesser fine even though it was a first-time \"offense\". When the police focus on [actus reus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actus_reus) rather than [mens rea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea), people stop trusting and respecting them.

How many people do you know who suffered grievous injuries because they were hit by a bicyclist? I understand you are annoyed by people biking on sidewalks, but annoyance is different from danger; bike riders pose no serious risk to anyone but themselves. Anyway I was told the police started ticketing people because the restaurant owners complained; they wanted their customers to be able to sit outside on the sidewalk during summer without being bothered by bicycles whizzing past them. I think the sidewalk, being public property, belongs as much to me as it does to people who choose to sit outside on the sidewalk to eat and drink. Screw that, I am glad they ticked your ass.  Sidewalks are public property used for WALKING.  A bicycle is a vehicle and should be used on the street, which is public property used for vehicles.  There is a reason this law exists dumbass, people have gotten hurt by people riding bikes on sidewalks.\n\nDo not tell me bike riders pose no risk to anyone but themselves.  If a bike is whizzing down a sidewalk and nails someone exiting a shop on the sidewalk, it will (and has) pose a great risk to the person stuck (and in fact generally more risk to the person stuck than the person riding the bike).\n\nSo fuck you, should be more than $100.  This is more serious than a 19 year old drinking.... Screw that, I am glad they ticked your ass.  Sidewalks are public property used for WALKING.

I agree with that. Everytime Ive talked to my DGS advisor they just tell me they dont know and to go talk to someone else.  Also hate how the whole idea behind it is to explore potential majors, yet they make it virtually impossible to register for any classes that are not gen-eds.  If you are looking to go into CS attempt to register for CS225 any chance you get.  Im currently going on semester number 3 of trying to get that class and probably wont get off the waiting list.  Best of luck to you tho, maybe in the end you will be able to get the required courses to transfer unlike me.  Not necessarily.

These Illini Alerts are seriously unnecessary. 99% of people who get these alerts are sleeping at that time. People who are near the area will see the fire/smoke and stay away, and the police can cordon off the area and keep people away. There is no need to wake so many people up in the middle of the night. Then don't sign up for the text alerts? It's optional, so why are you complaining? On the one hand I agree, but on the other hand it would be nice to subscribe to \"only alerts that I could possibly care about / react to.\" A reasonable argument to make is that Illini-Alert should only contain such alerts anyway! On the one hand I agree, but on the other hand it would be nice to subscribe to \"only alerts that I could possibly care about / react to.\" A reasonable argument to make is that Illini-Alert should only contain such alerts anyway! I think time of the day, whether the danger is localized, etc. should be taken into account. If there is an active shooter at large or hazardous chemicals have been released from a chemistry lab, it makes sense to inform everyone because the danger isn't contained in a limited area. If it is a fire that isn't spreading, only the building's residents and possibly the ones nearby need to know, especially at that time of the night, and the sirens from fire engines and police cars will wake them up. There was a fire at Za's in the morning last year and it made sense to send out that Illini Alert, since it saved people the inconvenience of going to Green Street and having to come back because it was closed - again, it was not dangerous (to people away from the area who received the alerts), but saved them some inconvenience.\n\nThat said, what is going on at First and John? Half the Illini Alerts are about incidents in that area - this one, and [this](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/courts-police-and-fire/2012-11-04/roommates-arrested-fight-brings-building-evacuation.html) and [this](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/courts-police-and-fire/2012-05-28/all-clear-given-campustown.html).

I applied last year as a senior and got wait-listed, and was wondering if that has any effect on my transfer decision?\n\n I am currently undecided but will complete 34-36 credits by Fall 2013 and possibly looking into the biology program. How hard is it to get in the biology or chemistry program there?\n\nAlso wondering about housing and scholarships. I might consider joining a sorority, so what is the process like for sophomores? And what about the housing situation? \n\nAlso, I know the transfer application deadline is pretty late in the year, and I am worried I will not get be able to apply/receive scholarships or receive sufficient financial aid, so does anyone have experience with this?\n\nI know I am asking for a lot, but I appreciate any input on your experience at UIUC so far!    I was accepted as a freshman transfer last Spring. Here's my experience: \n\nThat fact that you were wait-listed before will have no bearing on your decision this time around. However, as szaero pointed out, if you have less than 30 completed credits on your transcript when you apply, they will look at your high school transcript and ACT/SAT scores. \n\nI had a lot of health problems in high school, so I eventually dropped out. Then I got my GED and began taking classes online through Arizona State. After taking 12 credit hours (with 6 still in progress), I applied to UIUC in the Division of General Studies. Instead of directly applying to a program that interests you, I would highly recommend applying to DGS, as it is less selective and has very minimal requirements for transfers. Edit: It is very easy to transfer into the major of your choice after a semester or two at UIUC, so long as you meet the program's requirements and have decent grades.\n\nI know nothing about Sororities, so I can't help you there. However, with housing, I would not recommend the dorms. Renting an apartment (even a really nice apartment, close to campus) is almost always cheaper than the dorms. I have heard going this route makes it harder to make friends, but if you're considering going Greek and/or have a decent personality, you should be fine. Yup, I agree with this -- try for DGS.  I transferred into sociology before psych.  My GPA and everything was fine, but I had to take my alternative major choice at first because I was lacking one required class (I transferred in as a JR) that my CC didn't offer.  So I might have not been accepted into the program if it weren't for that. (Switching majors within LAS once you're in is incredibly easy-- take the req's you need, do well, and switch.  Easy as that.  Getting in is the hard part.)\n\n This is true except in the case of technical majors, which have entry requirements even once you are inside LAS. I'm glad it worked out for you!!

My subleasee just asked me to pay him a deposit on the place which he says I'll get back at the end. Is this reasonable and a regular thing for subleasees to ask?\n\nI know when you sign a contract for an apartment you need to pay a deposit, but is there any way for me as a subleaser to just have the deposit switched, instead of me having to pay the sublessee independently and just trusting that he will return the deposit once the term has ended??\n\nWhat is the general procedure for this??\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nEDIT: I should add that throughout this entire process, the sublesee has been very helpful and I trust him, but I just in case I don't want to lose a full months rent... I heard some housing companies are just dicks and won't return the deposit anyways, so I don't want to have to pay for the entire years worth of deposit if he wasn't going to be receiving it back anyways...   I agree that it's a good question to ask the Tenant's Union.  A deposit isn't totally out of the ordinary for a sublease, but make sure than the terms of the deposit are described in whatever contract or paperwork you plan to sign.  If I remember correctly, if you give anyone any sum of money, they are not bound to return it if they are not on contract.  I doubt your sublessor has ill intentions, but it's always better to be sure. Ahh I actualy just reread the sublease agreement that we signed and it actually is down on paper. I didn't know about how much the deposit would be, but on my agreement, its for the full deposit. I guess it's probably too late to ask that it only be for part of the deposit huh? :/   With JSM, part of the sublease agreement includes that the subleaser pay the the subleasee some percentage of the original deposit, to be returned upon end of agreement less any damages.\n\nGet your agreement in ink, preferably in the contract, and have it witnessed, signed, and/or maintained by the landlord. Ahh yea, I realized that it actually is on the sublease agreement that I signed, though its for the full deposit and not a percent of the original (though that number had been agreed upon already... now I realize I probably shouldve asked to pay just a percent of the original deposit shouldnt I?)\n\nI trust my subleaser, but I'm just worried since i've heard some companies never return the deposit anyways just because theyre dicks... did you ever have problems with JSM about that? (this lease is with Roland though)  If the apartment owner is CPM and [you getting your deposit back] is contingent upon [him getting his deposit back], then you might want to think about negotiating down to a half month's security deposit, unless the apartment is absolutely pristine. CPM is fairly reluctant to return security deposits at all, and often require badgering. Which is probably sensible for a company with so many tenants who are chicagoland students using their parents' money, eager to leave town as soon as possible. \n\nCPM kept my security deposit, but my roommate that year was unimaginably gross, so I'm not going to call that one dishonesty. I'm more basing this off friends' experiences, so treat this as a secondhand recommendation.

Maybe that's just my rose colored glasses trying to find anything positive though. My issue is Groce's mediocre (at best) record in the mid-majors.  If he couldn't hack it there, he won't hack it here. What exactly about John Groce's work at Ohio suggests that he couldn't \"hack it\" there? He not only made the tourney 2 of the 4 years he coached there  (an impressive enough feat considering they only made the tourney 1 time between 1994 and Groce's start in 2008), but each time, beat a team that was seeded 4 or better. Not to mention he took the #1 seeded team to overtime in the Sweet Sixteen game this year. He also brought in the talent that has propelled Ohio to their 5-0 start. Similarly, he just signed an impressive recruiting class for us in a short 7 months since taking the job. I'd say he'll hack it here just fine. After barely sneaking a win from Gardner-Webb?

You might get very lonely.\n\nI haven't talked to any girls in the past year and a half. That's only a mild exaggeration. And that is no one's fault but your own. Preach. This is a campus of 30,000 undergrads, 15,000 approximately female. You see literally hundreds of girls you have not yet ever talked to every day in the 10 minutes between every single class. So you can not say that you don't talk to girls because you can't find any.\n\nThe next thing you might argue is that there are no 'socially acceptable' ways to talk to girls. I call bullshit, and I will name three:\n\n1) Almost every lecture hall class has group projects, or at least projects where you can work with at least one partner. You could ask almost any girl in the class if she would like to work with you on something. Granted, there may be a smaller percentage of females in a CS class, but I have yet to find a CS class with over 100 students that has 0 girls. Also, she might say \"no, I'm working with someone else,\" but that's fairly unlikely and there are other options and other girls in the class.\n\n2) You can join student groups. Sure, CS groups generally also have a smaller female percentage, but most groups of decent size have at least some girls. Then, there are non-CS student groups which you could join, and women in almost all of them. Hell, if you really care about talking to women, go to Women in CS open office hours. You don't even have to leave Siebel! That group has a majority of female members! They've even got an Xbox with kinect so you can play dancing games with the girls there! \n\n3) You can go to public areas and meet women. If you live in a dorm, you can go to the lobby. If you don't live in a dorm, you can go to a dorm, wait for someone to swipe their iCard, then follow them into the lobby. There are lounges in the union, there are rest places in Siebel, and countless other public hang-out places I don't even know about. All of these places you know about, or could've easily found out about. Once you are in a public place, you can talk to anyone you please, and unless they ask you to leave them alone (as long as you're moderately pleasant, they most likely won't), you can keep talking to them until they have to leave.\n\nYou also might argue that you're too busy to talk to girls. Yeah right. Unless you have two jobs, are taking 18 credit hours, and won't be happy with anything less than a 4.0, you will have free time. You might choose to spend this free time, say, on reddit instead of talking to girls, but you will have at least some time. But even if you choose to spend your free time not talking to girls, you still have option 1 up above.\n\nSo I have preached, I have defended my case. If you never talk to girls, it is no one's fault but your own.\n\nAnd on one's going to read this because it's in a two day old thread, practically dead. Damn. I said preach and you preached.

It is more fun and less stress to study in a group, and you also get to know people and make friends that way.\n\n* Good grades are not about intelligence (you already have the required level if you get admitted to UIUC). They are about time management, organizational skills, networking (forming study groups, etc.). These soft skills will also be very useful later in life, in fact probably more than technical skills after a point.\n\n* UIUC is a good university with tons of resources to help you. Make use of those! Go to office hours, in fact, if possible, I would say go to office hours even if you were able to do the homework without help. Concepts are often reiterated in office hours and you might learn something new or understand something better just by going to office hours and observing the professor or TA answering someone else's questions. Grainger has study rooms, areas where you are allowed to talk and discuss - utilize those resources. \n\n* Do not take on more courseload than you are able to manage. You don't want to be miserable and stressed out trying to get your courses done sooner.\n\n* Have a life and interests outside your major. Join an RSO or some other club/activity/sports, but don't take on too many extracurricular activities.  I thought I covered all those.\n\n'Cept study groups, those are good too. If you rely exclusively on classes to meet people, you're not gonna meet many girls in most engineering majors. Doesn't matter what school, CS does not attract women in general.\n\nBasically, if you are naturally outgoing and have good time management, you're set for any/all majors.\n\nTime management is literally the most important thing in college. Most people who are overworked in college either procrastinate or take on way too many extracurricular responsibilities. \n\nGo to class, take notes, do homework/study early, and you should be fine. A guy told me he thought I was smarter than him; well, he came into college with insane time management and I just rode my \"intelligence\" through high school. I went from incoming James Scholar to academic probation in 2 years, only just now climbing out of the hole I dug. He destroyed all of his classes and still finds time to do everything he wants to. Pretty sure he's the smart one, not me.\n\nFuck it, I already typed too much:\n\nrawnoodles10 guide to college based on his mistakes and others' success:\n\n* Go to class, take notes (even mindless copying counts), do your hw/projects early. Starting early means you can go to office hours and ask the professor questions, I know a CS major that finished her huge project the first week it was assigned because she just kept asking the prof when she got stuck. You cannot do this 3 hours before the thing is due.\n\n* Rely on extracurriculars/dorm/friend's friends to meet people. You aren't going to see the same people in class till junior level classes, inverse is true for female/male ratio in engineering. You will probably know much fewer people overall than you did in high school.\n\n* Just get the default meal plan, I never saw anyone actually able to avoid wasting credits on the bigger ones. You're going to hate dorm food 1-2 months in. Same crap over and over. Rent yourself housing and learn to cook. Don't rent at CPM.\n\n* At UIUC, you don't need a car. Bus (pass included in tuition) can take you a block from anywhere, or bike. \n\n* Don't be afraid to talk to professors. They're generally pretty laidback and friendly. You can easily get research by looking up a profesor doing something interesting and knocking on their office door.\n\n* It's ok to fuck up. Grade replacement/dropping classes can let you catch up.\n\n* Doesn't hurt to ask, you can get a lot of stuff by just asking for it. Just don't bullshit. Can anybody else vouch for this? This actually is sort of a turn off, haha. Can anybody else vouch for this? This actually is sort of a turn off, haha. Can anybody else vouch for this? This actually is sort of a turn off, haha.

[deleted] Yeah, I'm interested in the logic and the theory behind it more than just being a code monkey. Is that a good thing? You'll love CS 173-273-373-473 Yeah, I'm interested in the logic and the theory behind it more than just being a code monkey. Is that a good thing?  &gt;if I'm gonna be clawing for extra hours of sleep and spending days without seeing sunlight\n\nIf you manage your time well this won't happen as often. But the thing is people who actually enjoy those hours struggling trying to finish an mp (machine problems, just a fancy word for CS hw) will do well in this field. You should come give it a shot and see how you do. If you don't like it we have other solid programs as well.\n\nAlso I didn't do much coding before I attended UIUC. It shouldn't be a problem.  If you manage your time, you'll be fine.\n\nI started in Aviation, transferred to Engineering for CS after two years while finishing up the Aviation program and did the Marching Illini and Basketball and Volleyball bands on top of that.  Spent an extra year to finish up, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nDo keep in mind that it is many ways a very theoretical program.  The focus is not on coding.. it's on the principles behind the coding.  Algorithms, Data Structures, and Hardware are all areas of emphasis.  I've heard it said that the Bachelor's program covers material that many other colleges cover in their Master's CS program.\n\nThis is both a good thing and a bad thing.  You'll be expected to pick up the languages that a given course is taught in as you go -- the focus isn't the language, the language is the tool to cover the material at hand.  Some people do well with that approach (I did).  Others do not.  It's an amazing program. If you manage your time properly and start assignments early, you never have to stay up late. However, once you reach sophomore year, second semester, it pretty much evolves from being a major into being a lifestyle. If you're okay, with CS related stuff dominating a majority of your time and your life then go for it. Also, people within CS are not exactly the most social. But I'm an international student so my experiences might be a little different. That's actually pretty worrying... I'm by no means a party animal but I am looking for some type of social college experience  That's actually pretty worrying...

It always seems to me like CS people aren't necessarily the worst people as a whole, but the worst people do seem to be CS people.  I concur. Obviously I can't generalize and make a statement for the population as a whole. I only have anecdotal evidence, but some of the ones I know have poor social skills and somewhat of an attitude problem (God's gift to mankind kind of attitude). It doesn't get better after they have finished undergrad, either, they stay the same later on, too. Watch \"The Social Network\" for an in-depth understanding; I don't know if it is representative of CS majors but it matches my experience and observations.\n\nTL; DR: CS major good for employability, bad for social, interpersonal and life skills. You would probably have to put in conscious, extra effort into socialization to make sure your social skills progress beyond the high school-level skills that you came in with. Good for employability, bad for life skills, which include knowing how to get a job.  I never did really learn that one.. and so, I'm in graduate school, where I can still survive without knowing how to do that.  I think I'm kind of odd in that respect though.. most people got quite a few offers all the time it seemed. That's unusual - I thought getting into UIUC CS grad school was harder than getting a job. I'm not in UIUC graduate school, I'm somewhere else.  But I think it was a number of things--I'd rather go to graduate school than be a software engineer because of the things I want to do, so I had more drive to push myself toward that; also, it's a different style of applying--no talking to recruiters and handing out resumes, which I found kind of difficult and which made me nervous all the time.\n\nI always wonder if I should just become a software engineer though... I'm sure I could get a job easily if I applied to a bunch of places and they do make more money, but I'd feel like I'd be stuck doing that forever and I never really wanted to in the first place. If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes. Eh, I don't think that's completely true.  There are definitely some alpha nerds who think they're ~~God's~~ Stallman's gift to the world, but they're typically holed up in the ACM office.  For the most part, I found that people were friendly and helpful.  Finding the right group of people to work with is key. &gt; There are definitely some alpha nerds who think they're ~~God's~~ Stallman's gift to the world, but they're typically holed up in the ACM office.\n\n...right along with a good number of decent people.  Some of the same people, in fact, that you're claiming are friendly and helpful. Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that everyone in ACM is a douche. The few people I ever got any sort of hostility from seemed to always be in ACM, **but**, as you say, most are very friendly and helpful; I should have made that clear. \n\nThe point is, FightingDucks was pretty liberal - or, rather, *wrong* - with his numbers by saying 90% of the people in CS are assholes.  It's much, much smaller than that. Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that everyone in ACM is a douche.

You publicly state that you're better than 90% of your classmates... and yet you think they're the stuck up assholes. no not better by any means at CS, hell i struggle to get by in it.  More social than 90% and have better personal skills, yes.  [deleted] Personal skills usually involve communication in person and not over an anonymous forum so this is not any indication. The whole concept of anonymous online forums is to be able to say whatever you want without worrying about the people around you taking offense and knowing who you are.  [deleted] Caring about something has nothing to do with personal skills, that just has to do with being a caring person who can show signs of empathy or sympathy.  And insult or not, it is true and OP asked about the program.  Im going to be honest and give my opinion which I stand by.  And as for the insulting people in a forum many of them read, I still think it was a good idea.  As you pointed out that many CS people read this, OP's chance of getting any honest responses that aren't just building up this program greatly decrease.  Are you that butthurt that about me saying that you are probably in this group who lacks interpersonal and social skills in real human interaction as opposed to communication behind the safety of your computer screen? [deleted] As stated before, I do not consider myself to be better than everyone else is.  I also doubt that we know each other, however that would be interesting wouldn't it. I am just saying that from my own personal interactions with CS undergrads, about 90% were very anti-social and came off as that god's gift to earth type.  That isnt to say that all CS people are like that, it is very possible that I have just had poor luck and that these are the ones I have interacted with. If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes. Is this your opinion or just the common mindset shared by most of the student body? I just posted this above but here is my opinion/ personal experiences...\n\nI stand by statement. I'm in CS so I have had plenty of interactions with other CS students. Perhaps 90% overall was a bit too high of a number but from my own personal experiences, I have met 1 or maybe 2 people in CS that weren't \"Gods gift to earth, I'm better than you, assholes.\" \n\nAlso I guess there are some experiences that sum it up better than others. For example just  a few weeks ago in lecture I tried to start a conversation with the guy next to me before the class started, all he responded with was \"what the fuck do you want go bother someone else.\"  Also last year in a discussion section some kid asked a question (maybe not the best question but that is what discussion sections are for) and one kid stood up and cussed the kid out calling him a dipshit who was making \"all of us smart kids in CS look bad.\"  If you are a social kid then you will hate it. 90% of CS kids here are assholes.   If you want a fantastic social life (ie. go out 3 nights a week), a CS major is the farthest thing from it, \n\nConsider studying Information Systems in the College of Business if you want a great social life and are interested in computers (especially in more general terms).    I don't think there is anything \"reasonable\" about UIUC's out of state tuition... \n\n I'm an out of state student. U of I's rate for us is much lower than public schools in other schools for students that wish to study out of state. When I was considering different schools, I do believe that Georgia Tech was about $4k/yr less than U of I though.  Its great. The classes are extremely easy and there are a ton of girls everywhere.\n\nEdit: Ok, on a serious note. There are plenty of assholes in CS of course, and you have to find the people that aren't assholes- but that's not hard. And don't take the gender ratio jokes seriously- the majority of my CS friends are girls (I'm a guy) and this is purely by accident, not because I only try to make friends with girls. Of course there gender ratio is pretty skewed, but its not impossible to work around. (Basically, if you're going into CS for girls you're doing it very wrong, but as long as you have some sort of social presence, you shouldn't have to worry about it.)\n\nThere's a good mix of everything from the \"hardware\" side to the \"theory\" side of the spectrum, and a lot of programming in between. As for having prior experience, I came in with very little and I'm doing pretty fine. There's plenty of work, of course, but that's to be expected. You will learn a lot; its not like professors give you busy work, or strange problems where you have no idea why you're supposed to be doing this. &gt; the majority of my CS friends are girls (I'm a guy) and this is purely by accident, not because I only try to make friends with girls\n\nWhat a thinly veiled attempt at calling yourself a baller.

You are paid (let's say in a STEM field something around $2k/month) to be a TA with a \"50% appointment\", meaning you are supposed to spend 50% of your time TAing. The other 50% of your time (in reality, this takes up a lot more than 20 additional hours per week) is research, but you don't get paid for that time....  If you assume a TA works a combined 40hrs/wk, which is a gross underestimate for anyone I've met, that's something like $13/hour. In the sciences you are usually prohibited from having another job because you're expected to spend all your time on research. The wage you earn from TAing is your only income.\n\nFor those asking why a tuition waiver guarantee is necessary... it is laughable to consider what would happen if the university took waivers away. Any student who had any other options for grad school would not be paying to come here when other schools will pay to have you. This means no students to do research, no one to produce work for PIs who need work done to win more grants... in the long term, no warm bodies to do teaching and no more grant money coming in.

I'm pretty sure these tuition waivers don't necessarily apply to STEM graduate students.

As a STEM graduate student, I didn't always get paid through my PI's grants and TAing was not an extra source of income. \n\nUsually, you TA the first few semesters for your salary, then you are put on as a research assistant and the salary comes from your PI somewhere. But there's no additional money if you TA. It just changes where your salary comes from. That could change from dept to dept.\n\nAgreed that tuition is (usually) not a problem in my field... but then if this issue is not about grad students keeping their existing tuition waivers, what is it about?

The issue is about protecting tuition waivers, but here are the [numbers](http://www.ahr.illinois.edu/grads/GEO1213rates.pdf).\n\nIf you want to actually understand the GEO's position, you can read [this](http://www.uigeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TuitionWaiverFAQfront.jpg). From that link - it seems like taking away the tuition waivers is breaking the contract they signed. Isn't that illegal? If this is the case, wouldn't court be the best option as opposed to trying to reason with the school?\n\nAlso, does this only affect grad students in Fine and Applied Arts?

And thanks for the links by the way  I would like to address a little bit about your question of the necessity of a tuition waiver. The base stipend in my department is 20k pretax, and unless you get additional fellowship, this is all you get. We get minimally taxed on that, but heavily taxed on *any additional scholarship we get over the base stipend**. We also pay all the student fees that for the most part, we don't really benefit from anyway.\n\nSo we are now at about 17k a year. For a 25 year old with a modest student loan, I can live on it well enough to afford to share an apartment and a car with my boyfriend and an annual trip home to see my aging parents. \n\nIf the tuition waiver was taken away, I would not be afford to live. Not without a loan anyway. This is not the deal I signed on to give up other opportunities. Sure, 20k for a 50% appointment sounds like a lot, but nobody I know--at illinois or anywhere else, actually work 20h and not expected to be kicked out of grad school (I know people who had been asked to leave for this reason). I would say between the engineering and science grads I know, we work between 40-80 hours a week because that's what academia demands of us.\n\nI went to a well ranked undergrad program and I have an impressive enough cv to get into this school. I can confidently say that if I wasn't offered financial support here, I would have ditched this for a fully funded program 5 ranks lower. Or not go to grad school at all. And this is representative of the sentiment among my social circles. If this school wants to flush its academic reputation down the toilet, this would be a good way to go. \n\nEdit because my memory failed me. TAs and RAs don't pay taxes on the waiver.  [deleted] Have you read past the first line?\n\n&gt; This taxation does not apply to qualified Teaching Assistants or Research Assistants.   If I remember correctly, they make just under $17,000 a year, which is the poverty line. (A TA of mine had a long talk about this.) As an LAS TA, I make just under $12,000 a year.

Read it through once just so you've seen the whole argument.  A second time for structure of the argument, which sections of the paper establish which aspects of the argument.  Third time for what is the logic of the argument, even though you don't understand many of the concepts.\n\nYou will now find that there are several key concepts that the paper cannot be understood without, and that you don't understand.  Google them.  Wikipedia them.  Now read the paper again.\n\nMore key concepts you don't understand.  Google/wikipedia.  You will also have questions about the logic and evidence that an intelligent novice would ask.  Ask them privately to the most helpful person in the reading group.  Once you have a feel for what the level of discussion is, you will even know which ones are appropriate for public discussion.\n\nOne of the very most valuable aspects of the Illinois academic culture is the pre-graduate-school flavor of the last two years.

The only person that I knew (outside of friends of acquaintances) who went to Illinois was my boyfriend at the time. These two things are important because 1. I came here after the Chief was no longer our mascot and 2. Unlike many people who go here, I didn't have any friends or family who went to Illinois while the Chief was popular/still around (except for the bf) and therefore was never really exposed to that culture/\"pride\"/etc. So basically, I've never had any sort of \"allegiance\" to the Chief and don't really have much of an opinion either way, outside of a slight negative feeling.\n\nThe [APA](http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx) and the [NCAA](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2125735) both agree that the use of Native American mascots is harmful and creates a \"hostile environment\". I can definitely see where they're coming from.\n\nSo to those of you who support the use of the Chief: why? How do you feel about the views from organizations like the APA? \n\n**tl;dr: I came to this school after the Chief was retired and didn't know anyone who came here/was never exposed to love for the Chief. I don't really have much of an opinion either way and I'm curious as to why people are such strong defenders of the mascot.**\n\nThanks! =D\n\n**Edit: Wow, I'm overwhelmed and surprised by the amount of feedback I've gotten! The vast majority of the responses were very calm and respectful on both sides, and I thank you for that; I was expecting a serious shitblizzard, to be honest!**\n\n**It seems like this whole thing is broken down two different ways.**\n\n**For: The Chief was a symbol of honor, leadership, unity, and other positive things. He brought the campus community together and was an important part of the University culture. The loss of this symbol has left a hole in the community. Since he was always portrayed respectfully, and had support from Native Americans at some point (?), it is unfair to call him racist and anyone who says otherwise is being oversensitive or is unaware of all of the details of the Chief. Some people have said that the Chief was banned simply because the NCAA wished it to be so, without any feedback from the campus community. Some people in this group respect the decision to cease use of the Chief, while some are very unhappy with it.**\n\n**Against: The Chief is a racist caricature of what it means to be Native American. He would dress up in the expected attire, and do a dance that people would expect a Native American to do. The dance is offensive because it is based on stereotypical movements with Boy Scout routines or religious ceremonial dance (both have been stated in the comments), and the costume is offensive because there are parts of it that have significance with spirituality, community, and other important aspects of NA culture. Positive stereotypes/generalization are still harmful to minority groups, and the Chief and Native Americans are an example of this.**\n\n**Overall, most of the comments have really helped me gain a better understanding of Chief Illiniwek and his impact on campus culture, both positive and negative. I'm very grateful for that, and am always open to more information!**  This really is the right question to ask. Not (only) whether the Chief is or isn't racist, but what's at the root of the school's attachment to this figure in particular.\n\nWould students and alumni have such a deeply-rooted emotional attachment to the Chief if it arose around the same time period but was something else -- an animal, for example? That is, is the attachment to the Chief just about history/tradition?\n\nIs the attachment to the Chief rooted in the principles that supporters often say he stands for -- leadership, honor, unity and so forth? If so, why can't another figure stand in for those principles? An American soldier, for example? Why would an Indian be uniquely evocative of those concepts in ways that nothing or no one else could? Is it the principles themselves that are most important or what supposedly represents them?\n\nOr is loyalty toward the Chief really just displaced loyalty toward the university, the team, or the town? And if so, can another figure stand in for that equally well? Does school/town spirit really depend on what supposedly symbolizes it to exist (to the same extent)? \n\nSeveral posters have suggested that schools with cartoonish mascots don't command the same kind of devotion that the Chief does. Would they, if they were figures similar to the Chief -- native figures dancing in full dress? \n\nHow much of the university's relationship to the Chief is tied into American popular culture's relationship with native people, in other words? Is the devotion the Chief commands uniquely rooted in his Indianness, or in something else?\n\n Very good questions. The American soldier angle fits in with the supposed origin of \"Fighting Illini\" - UIUC students who went off to fight in WWI. I think the Indian-ness makes the Chief a more \"mystical\" figure, rather than an American soldier, which any of us could be. Unfortunately, I think there was very little connection between the Chief and the actual native people, their cultures, and values. That may be one of the biggest failures, and reasons for the Chief's retirement: the use of this symbol without a widespread understanding of Indian culture and history among the student community.\n\nI also wonder if those values of honor, tradition, etc. were instilled in the Chief from his inception, or if those were applied gradually over time. I know that in the last years, the Chief ONLY appeared at halftime of home sporting events. Earlier in his history, the Chief appeared more frequently - away games, parades, and promotional shots (I remember some random pictures of the Chief at different locations on the 1952 Rose Bowl trip). It seems like the reverence with which the Chief acted increased over time. I don't know if that was an attempt to embody those values more fully or to curb some anti-Chief backlash.

The Chief in general and the halftime dance was a ritual which was revered at the university and kind of brought the fans together, like any other group ritual.

Even if it is not meant with bad intentions.\n\nYeah, I understand that for sure. Like in the APA article:\n&gt;According to Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, University of Arizona, this appears to have a negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children. \"American Indian mascots are harmful not only because they are often negative, but because they remind American Indians of the limited ways in which others see them. This in turn restricts the number of ways American Indians can see themselves.\"\n\nThank you for your response! &gt;Ultimately though, to have a white guy in a native american chief costume dancing at halftime of a sporting event is racist. Even if it is not meant with bad intentions.\n\n\"It would be wrong to call the art of Native American dancing inherently demeaning if performed by a non-Native American, even in a more public venue. Certainly, the evidence from Native American gatherings does not justify the claim of sacrilege.\"\n\nI find it completely ridiculous to assert that any portrayal of a Native American dance by a non Native American as racist.  I think the best way to understand the pro-Chief side of things would be to read through the FAQ section for The Tradition on the [Honoring The Chief site](http://www.honorthechief.com/Tradition/index.html).\n\n &gt;I find it completely ridiculous to assert that any portrayal of a Native American dance by a non Native American as racist.\n\nWe know that Chief's apparel is not representative of the Illini tribe's apparel. I'm inclined to assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that his dance is likewise not representative. It was created by the Souix tribe.  While it might not be representative of the Illini tribe exactly, seeing as they don't exist anymore, there's really nothing better than having an authentic regalia made by a tribe for us.\n\nThe dance is taught to each Chief under the tutelage of one of the nearby tribes, and is accurate to dances that they do.  When you assume, it makes an ass out of u and me. The Sioux and the 12-13 tribes that we recognize as the Illini Confederation were/are completely different cultural groups. It makes no sense to argue that substituting one group's authentic clothing and another group's authentic dance for an entirely different group's dress and dance is \"accurate enough\" because they're all Native American.\n\nAt a different level, you can question whether the performance would be authentic even if the costume and the dance were truly accurate to one of the Illini Confederation tribes. If the mascot was the General, and a student who never served in the military put on his great grandfather's World War I uniform, and did a historically accurate Drill Team routine, would this be an authentic representation of a Veteran? Would you expect Veterans to feel honored? If the performer did not earn every medal and honor that the uniform symbolizes, then the performance is inaccurate, inauthentic, and disrespectful, regardless of how authentic the actual uniform and routine are. Several elements of the Chief's uniform symbolically represent particular acts of bravery, community, and spirituality, that the actual Chief who first wore it earned--any student who wore it after, no matter how good of a student, did not deserve to wear it. It wasn't worn by any actual Native American Chief.  It was made by the Souix specifically for this purpose. Everything else you said, I have to say I agree with, however. My apologies for that error. The Sioux and the 12-13 tribes that we recognize as the Illini Confederation were/are completely different cultural groups. It makes no sense to argue that substituting one group's authentic clothing and another group's authentic dance for an entirely different group's dress and dance is \"accurate enough\" because they're all Native American.\n\nAt a different level, you can question whether the performance would be authentic even if the costume and the dance were truly accurate to one of the Illini Confederation tribes. If the mascot was the General, and a student who never served in the military put on his great grandfather's World War I uniform, and did a historically accurate Drill Team routine, would this be an authentic representation of a Veteran? Would you expect Veterans to feel honored? If the performer did not earn every medal and honor that the uniform symbolizes, then the performance is inaccurate, inauthentic, and disrespectful, regardless of how authentic the actual uniform and routine are. Several elements of the Chief's uniform symbolically represent particular acts of bravery, community, and spirituality, that the actual Chief who first wore it earned--any student who wore it after, no matter how good of a student, did not deserve to wear it. Devil's Advocate: We put on Civil War re-enactments all of the time and I wouldn't say that people are \"dishonored\" by someone pretending to be a civil war hero. They're just acting a part... &gt;Ultimately though, to have a white guy in a native american chief costume dancing at halftime of a sporting event is racist. Even if it is not meant with bad intentions.\n\n\"It would be wrong to call the art of Native American dancing inherently demeaning if performed by a non-Native American, even in a more public venue. Certainly, the evidence from Native American gatherings does not justify the claim of sacrilege.\"\n\nI find it completely ridiculous to assert that any portrayal of a Native American dance by a non Native American as racist.  I think the best way to understand the pro-Chief side of things would be to read through the FAQ section for The Tradition on the [Honoring The Chief site](http://www.honorthechief.com/Tradition/index.html).\n\n I see what you mean; the Chief was meant as a symbol for the university that brought a lot of people together and instilled pride in something they shared.\n\n&gt; Ultimately though, to have a white guy in a native american chief costume dancing at halftime of a sporting event is racist. Even if it is not meant with bad intentions.\n\nYeah, I understand that for sure. Like in the APA article:\n&gt;According to Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, University of Arizona, this appears to have a negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children. \"American Indian mascots are harmful not only because they are often negative, but because they remind American Indians of the limited ways in which others see them. This in turn restricts the number of ways American Indians can see themselves.\"\n\nThank you for your response! Its something which has been a tradition at the U of I for a long time, and people have trouble letting go of that, I'd say this is the biggest thing.  The Chief in general and the halftime dance was a ritual which was revered at the university and kind of brought the fans together, like any other group ritual.

I hate to tell you but saying because he was portrayed by a white person it is wrong is racism.\n\nNot caring about the race of the actor playing the symbol isn't racism. This was not my intention to say \"its only racist because its a white guy in the costume\", if that was what I meant that is what I would have said.  The rest is you inferring things.\n\n  I'm just trying give my thoughts on the OP's question from the perspective of someone who grew up here, went to school here, still lives here, and comes from a couple generations of graduates from the U of I.

Thank you for sharing. Do you think other people don't really care about the concerns of that tribe? Do you know what the response was from the campus community in regards to the tribe's request to cease use of the Chief? I don't know if people care or not. It's easy to brush off a group's concern as \"over-sensitivity\" when you're not a member of the marginalized group. \n\nIn regards to community response: apparently some alums stopped donating &amp; refuse to return to campus, according to /u/Trakis. If that's true, I think that speaks volumes about their pride in the school.

So if white Europeans don't like it when black people dress up as knights, is it their right to say \"You can't dress up like our long dead ancestors anymore\"?\n\nWhat you are suggesting is racism. **While I do not have strong feelings on this, I feel compelled to respond to your argument since I think it is deeply flawed. Please remember that my response is not a rabid political correctness screed, but rather a critique of your analogy.**\n\nAttempts to analogize the experience of a historically marginalized, discriminated-against people who have been the victims of genocide, despoliation, or forced labor to the experience of a group that is a historical control majority with no such background of atrocities is inherently flawed. \n\nSecondly, this isn't about \"white folks\" using Chief - if you hadn't noticed, there's a lot of diversity at Illinois - it's about a public entity using Chief. The decisions it makes represents us all. In that way, your analogy to \"black people dressing up like knights\" fails.\n\nEven if a Knight MIGHT be a good analogy to a Chief or a Brave, remember that the appearance of Chief Illiniwek is not based upon authentic tribal dress of the Illini tribe; it is a stereotyped minstrel show. In this way, perhaps our hypothetical Knights name is not offensive, but the mascot itself is wearing an amalgam of armor from Japanese Samurai and Zulu warriors. The people using the name don't care about authenticity no matter what they claim, they're happy with their false caricature that marginalizes the group targeted. Now, we're going to have to also assume a hypothetical where African warriors poured out of Africa into Europe and exterminated white Europeans with disease and warfare, snatching up their land, and leaving them relegated to dwelling on small reservations as a pittance. \n\n----\n\nI don't understand the attachment to Chief Illiniwek. Or to the Redskins. Or the Cleveland Indians, or the Atlanta Braves, or the Pekin Chinks, or the Florida State Seminoles, or a hypothetical basketball team called the New Orleans Fighting Mandingos. \n\nMascots can have a great deal of meaning, but I can't understand why that's worth hurting other people. Maybe many Native Americans don't have a problem with it. Some do. And it's with good reason - just as good as outrage against the Chinks or Fighting Mandingos. Racism isn't cool. \n\nSo yeah, I came here gladly. I shout \"CHIEEEEEEEF!\" along with everyone else at the football games. But, while I'm not driven to change the name, I can understand why it's an issue, and I don't understand the desire to defend a racist past. I certainly don't think, \"It's not really THAT racist\" is a good reason to defend it. \n\nMy biggest reason for opposition? God, I don't want to wind up with a 9 foot hillbilly as a mascot and a name like the Cornhuskers. But surely we're more creative than Nebraska? &gt; Attempts to analogize the experience of a historically marginalized, discriminated-against people who have been the victims of genocide, despoliation, or forced labor to the experience of a group that is a historical control majority with no such background of atrocities is inherently flawed.\n\nNo living member claiming relation to the american indian population was ever the victim of any such atrocity.

Chief Illiniwek's dress is based on a gift to the University of Illinois from the chief of the Oglala Sioux.  The real regalia was retired immediately out of respect as it contained real Eagle feathers.  It was presented to the University in 1982 by Chief Fools Crow himself.  Prior to this point Chief Illiniwek's regalia was authentic to the Illiniwek.  His appearance is and was and remembrance of the great honor Chief Fools Crow provided us through the regalia.\n\nLearn your history. You seem to be forgetting that the permission to use the regalia was [revoked several years ago by Chief Fools Crow and the tribe, and the university was forced to give it back](http://www.ucimc.org/content/chief-illiniwek-regalia-returned-ogalala-lakota), because the tribe did not agree with how it was being used as part of a minstrel show.\n\nLearn your history. &gt; Attempts to analogize the experience of a historically marginalized, discriminated-against people who have been the victims of genocide, despoliation, or forced labor to the experience of a group that is a historical control majority with no such background of atrocities is inherently flawed.\n\nNo living member claiming relation to the american indian population was ever the victim of any such atrocity.

You need to look up your statements, specifically the blanket/absolute ones.

My opinions on the chief are irrelevant, since [the group that mascot is supposed to represent requested the Chief's retirement](http://aistm.org/2000peoria.htm). Why are their names non-Native American?   I think more people would rather have no new mascot than a replacement for the Chief. Most people I know aren't calling to have the Chief back, he is banned for good reason. But he was around for 80 years, and still means a lot to the U of I community. \n\nTo create an analogy, imagine that U of I and the Chief were married, and all the alumni and students that enjoyed his presence were their children. Now it would be like U of I and the Chief are divorced, and U of I is trying to replace the children's parent. It is not going to go over well in the eyes of the \"children\" But the \"children\" will graduate and the new students deserve to have a mascot if they want one.  I too didn't go to Illinois until after the Chief was retired.  But don't forget:  U of I are still the Fighting Illini.  Chief Illiniwek is the symbol for that.  And when you talk to Alumni who did experience the chief, it was a HUGE part of their life at Illinois.  There are people who refuse to return to campus, or have cancelled their annual donations just because the Chief is gone.  \n\nAlso, have you ever seen an old football or basketball halftime dance by the Chief?  Shit gives you goosebumps. Hopefully some other people can also give you some insight.    The goosebumps depend on the spectator. I took a girlfriend to an Illini game who had just moved here from Minnesota to establish residency prior to grad school. She knew nothing of the Chief. She was absolutely horrified at halftime by the dance.\n\nI still get a little teary eyed watching the dance online, but it comes both from the attachment I have to this institution as well as the conflict that the Chief represented. Horrified?  Sounds like you had a girlfriend that was a little too emotional.  There is nothing remotely \"horrifying\" about the performance.  If it was all made up and impromptu, then sure.  If the portrayer wasn't trained for weeks on how to accurately portray the dance alongside several members of the tribe, maybe.  But all this happened, and still does. &gt; Sounds like you had a girlfriend that was a little too emotional. There is nothing remotely \"horrifying\" about the performance. \n\nSo you get to decide (for others) what is horrifying and who is too emotional? It's my opinion, so yes, I do get to decide.  Who said that I am deciding anything for other people? Horrified?  Sounds like you had a girlfriend that was a little too emotional.  There is nothing remotely \"horrifying\" about the performance.  If it was all made up and impromptu, then sure.  If the portrayer wasn't trained for weeks on how to accurately portray the dance alongside several members of the tribe, maybe.  But all this happened, and still does. Accurately portray the dance?\n\nThe dance was created by Boy Scouts. It was based on fancy dance, yes, but that doesn't mean it's authentic in any way.

I guess that's a major reason why I'm asking about this - I don't know the magnitude of the love for the Chief/how it was when he was still around. I'm from around SIUC, and I feel like they don't have as much love for the Saluki as they do the Chief, so I didn't really think that a mascot following could be so strong. =) No prob.  And to add on.  It's interesting you mentioned that you were from SIU (I have no intention of bashing, or being offensive at all to them right now).  I have absolutly no idea what life at/on SIU is like.  But Illinois is a MASSIVE Big 10 school.  With this conference, comes a massive love for our sports teams.  Not to bash SIU, but they aren't a Division 1A school, that competes on a national level in all sports (Technically...)  That's where the Chief comes in.\n\nSchool spirit is wrapped around our mascot.  Every half time game would have the Chief give a wonderful performance that gets EVERYONE fired up.  And overnight, it was taken away.  \n\nAnd I guess that is what makes Illinois unique.  You don't really see Michigan going crazy over the Wolverine.  Our mascot and The Chief is something that this school was really founded on.  And he was gone in the blink of an eye. Don't worry, SIU is boring (which is one reason why I didn't go!). No offense taken. ;)\n\nSo do you feel like people think that there is something missing? Like they lost a symbol to bond over that represents the school and the pride they have in it? Don't worry, SIU is boring (which is one reason why I didn't go!). No offense taken. ;)\n\nSo do you feel like people think that there is something missing? Like they lost a symbol to bond over that represents the school and the pride they have in it?  As someone who grew up in Urbana, I can say that I was absolutely devastated when they got rid of the Chief.  The Chief's dance was always my favorite part of any sporting event, and I will never forget the feeling of pride that it always inspired in me.\n\nI understand that some of the people who are the descendants of those the Chief is meant to be a depiction of find it to be racist, but I have never understood why.  The Chief may not be an accurate depiction, but I knew a couple of the chief dancers and the amount of work they put into studying and learning that dance was massive.  The Chief was universally idolized and loved by anyone who followed Illinois sports at all, and the camaraderie inspired by supporting him was great.  I don't at all understand why that was viewed to create a negative stereotype of a people (particularly when I guarantee you that the majority of students couldn't tell you exactly who he was supposed to be based off of).\n\nBut, even though I strongly disagree with and do not understand the motivation behind the removal of the Chief, I do respect it.  That doesn't mean I have to like it, though. Putting a lot of work into memorizing the dance is all fine and good. Nobody is saying that the Chief dancers didn't take their dance seriously.\n\nThe problem is that the dance was made-up and effectively a caricature of native american culture. We parade out our little Indian, have him dance around for a few minutes for our amusement, and then get back to our sport.\n\nYeah, the chief was fun to watch... But he was a caricature of the society he was supposed to represent. Absolutely, any mascot is a caricature.  He was a caricature based in research and created in collaboration with a tribe of Sioux.  Hell, the costume worn by the Chief since the 80s was made by the wife of a Sioux Chief.  I will grant that the likelihood that the representation of the Chief changed somewhat since its inception is high, but he was universally loved and respected by the students, and stood for absolutely nothing unholy, and I don't see at all how he could be seen as \"degrading racial stereotype that reflects negatively on all American Indian people\".\n\nI understand that it's how they feel and I don't fault them that, there's no one that can tell someone else how they should feel, I simply don't understand where the feeling comes from. One Sioux Chief's wife making the head dress doesn't mean anything. That's akin to saying that it's okay for me to wear blackface as long as a black guy put it on me. Obviously, an extreme example - but can you see the similarities? Just because one person, even one small group of people, said it's okay, doesn't mean it's okay with everybody else.\n\nIf he was universally loved and respected by the students, how come there are groups of students who are against the chief?\n\nI was talking to a Native American friend once, and she explained it to me sort of like this - let me see if it gives you some insight;\n\nImagine that you have everything taken away from you. Your family used to own the entire US. Now, you're forced onto squalid reservations, and everybody's poor, alcoholic, and uneducated... But you've still got your heritage to hold on to. It sounds funny, but that heritage as a Native American is that one last thing you have - so you hold onto it like hell.\n\nThen some college kids dress up in a costume like yours, make up a dance, put it to brass music, and go hopping around while people do the Tomahawk Chop - something that literally emphasizes the most brutish aspect of Native American lifestyle. After a few minutes of him hopping around, they shove him away.\n\nYour heritage - that list thing you had - has just been taken away from you. Instead, you're something for people to watch while they drink beers - you have become half-time entertainment. Oh I in no way meant it was ok just because the Sioux said it was ok, I was just saying that it wasn't just completely made up based on stereotypes.  The dance was created in collaboration with the Sioux so it was based SOMEWHAT on something real, as opposed to just some white kids coming up with something they think looks Native American.\n\nAnd fair enough, universally loved was a poor choice of words.  What I meant was, no one watched the Chief and laughed (I use the word \"no one\" with the knowledge that there's ALWAYS someone), people watched the Chief and cheered.  Those who supported the Chief didn't think he was funny or stereotypical, they thought he was badass.  They loved him and supported him and cheered his name.  It just doesn't compute with me that having an even horribly inaccurate representation of your people that people love and cheer for and think is awesome could be construed as a bad thing.\n\nThe heritage thing makes sense, and I can sympathize with it, although in that place my reaction would be more \"look at the silly white men trying to emulate us\" instead of \"those assholes are making fun of us\".\n\nAgain I want to reiterate that I in no way fault them for feeling that way, or believe that they should feel another way, it's just a very different reaction than my brain would have, but I am admittedly a very hard person to offend.  I don't want to come off as a racist prick here haha. &gt;The heritage thing makes sense, and I can sympathize with it, although in that place my reaction would be more \"look at the silly white men trying to emulate us\" instead of \"those assholes are making fun of us\".\n\nIt's easy to say that when you view yourself on equal footing. They are the oppressed - the white man the oppressors. Therein lies the problem.\n\n&gt;Again I want to reiterate that I in no way fault them for feeling that way, or believe that they should feel another way, it's just a very different reaction than my brain would have, but I am admittedly a very hard person to offend. I don't want to come off as a racist prick here haha.\n\nDon't worry. I've enjoyed hearing your points and seeing the way you think. While I disagree with you, I still respect your opinion - and I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me! Upboats for everyone! As someone who grew up in Urbana, I can say that I was absolutely devastated when they got rid of the Chief.  The Chief's dance was always my favorite part of any sporting event, and I will never forget the feeling of pride that it always inspired in me.\n\nI understand that some of the people who are the descendants of those the Chief is meant to be a depiction of find it to be racist, but I have never understood why.  The Chief may not be an accurate depiction, but I knew a couple of the chief dancers and the amount of work they put into studying and learning that dance was massive.  The Chief was universally idolized and loved by anyone who followed Illinois sports at all, and the camaraderie inspired by supporting him was great.  I don't at all understand why that was viewed to create a negative stereotype of a people (particularly when I guarantee you that the majority of students couldn't tell you exactly who he was supposed to be based off of).\n\nBut, even though I strongly disagree with and do not understand the motivation behind the removal of the Chief, I do respect it.  That doesn't mean I have to like it, though. They may have put a lot of time into learning the dance, but it doesn't seem to be an accurate depiction of Native American dance: \n\n\"Professor Farnell cited the following:\n\n.\u2026 it is frequently claimed that the person portraying the Chief is knowledgeable about Native American cultures, dances and music. The faculty members in our department whose areas of research and teaching focus specifically upon the music and dances of Native North America find this claim untenable. In marked contrast to indigenous dance forms, the choreographed movements performed by the Chief are a combination of stereotyped gestures and steps taken from the Boy Scout movement and Wild West Shows of the 1920s and 30s, supplemented by acrobatic display. The musical accompaniment is likewise a stereotypic misrepresentation derived from early Hollywood movies.\"\n\nhttp://www.uillinois.edu/trustees/dialogue/report_files/addendum.htm As someone who grew up in Urbana, I can say that I was absolutely devastated when they got rid of the Chief.

Do you know if they had to study any other cultural things associated with the Chief, or was it just the dance?\n\nThanks for your response!   I'm a lifelong Urbana resident and now that I attend UIUC I can't help being frustrated by students who side Chief without even understanding the complexity of the issue, or the fact the university spent multiple years conflicted over the decision.  The Chief didn't simply up and go.  People fought long and hard on both sides, and ultimately the university decided to retire a mascot that represents stereotyping and repression. I'm aware the OP asked for comments who support the chief, but I just thought I 'd share my thoughts, and a bit of background for those who feel so strongly.  Yes, though the university did it in the worst possible way: They convened a meeting during a snow closure (The St. Valentine's Day storm of 2007 where we got 14\" of snow), which was orchestrated by a now-disgraced group of trustees, and told students they would not hear any dissenting opinions.\n\nThe primary reasoning behind this was the NCAA coming down and denying our ability to host post-season events as long as we had a offensive mascot, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nEdit: Corrected spelling. &gt;The primary reasoning behind this was the NCAA coming down and denying our ability to host post-season events as long as we had a offensive mascot, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nThis. 100% this.  If there were no postseason bans, or any monetary downside to them keeping The Chief, he would still be here.  Guarantee it.  If only the tribe that he represents were still around, like FSU and the Seminoles, then everything would be just fine. Read the top comment, the tribe he represents requested him retired. Read the top comment, the tribe he represents requested him retired. That could not be any farther from the truth.  The tribe he represents no longer exists.  Random other Native American activists requested that he be retired.  There have been many studies that show that something like 90% of Native Americans support the use of Native American imagery and iconography in sports/schools.  There is a LARGE difference between the feelings of Native Americans and Native American activists. &gt; There is a LARGE difference between the feelings of Native Americans and Native American activists.\n\nThat is misguided, saying that non-Native Americans have no right to empathize with or participate in activism on behalf of Native Americans. It's like saying non-Jews shouldn't have an opinion about the Holocaust, because hey, it didn't concern them, or, white people shouldn't have had a problem with slavery, because hey, it didn't concern them, and in fact they benefited from it. Social justice transcends immediate and personal connections. The Chief issue is nowhere as bad as the Holocaust or slavery, which were terrible human rights violations, but the underlying principle of non-directly-affected people protesting is similar. So you don't think that you should take the opinions of those who are supposedly \"bastardized\" by this symbol as more important than an assortment of activists?  I never stated once that the activists were non-Native Americans. &gt;There is a LARGE difference between the feelings of Native Americans and Native American activists.\n\nand\n\n&gt;I never stated once that the activists were non-Native Americans.\n\nI don't really understand you.

There is a LARGE difference between the feelings of Native Americans and Native American activists. Yeah, I'm going to need a source. &gt;Over the years, the Chief Illiniwek tradition has had continued endorsement of Native American descendents. Since the tradition's inception in 1926, there has been considerable support for the Chief by Native American leaders, including several that trace their lineage to the original Illini tribes. \nIn 2002, a Peter Harris Research Group poll showed that 81% of Native Americans support the use of Indian nicknames in high school and college sports, and 83% of Native Americans support the use of Indian mascots and symbols in professional sports. The accompanying commentary concluded that the \u201cpoll suggests that although Native American activists are virtually united in opposition to the use of Indian nicknames and mascots, the Native American population sees the issue far differently.\u201d \nIn September 2004, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s National Annenberg Election Survey reported the results of a year-long poll which showed that the vast majority of American Indians say that calling Washington\u2019s professional football team the \u201cRedskins\u201d does not bother them (90% of Indians took that position, while 9% said they found the name \u201coffensive\u201d).\n\nhttp://www.honorthechief.com/Tradition/index.html Works for me thanks!

I'm aware the OP asked for comments who support the chief, but I just thought I 'd share my thoughts, and a bit of background for those who feel so strongly.  Interesting comments from someone who has no fucking idea what he is talking about.  The University retiring the chief had everything to do with NCAA post season ban and nothing to do with representing \"stereotyping\" and \"repression\".   The post-season ban is the result of a stereotypical mascot.  Thus, when the university removes said mascot, as a result of pressures by NCAA (who have moral obligations to the Chief), they are retiring a mascot that was much maligned for being a stereotype. My statement stands.  how does it feel to be wrong You should tell me.  I don't understand why the \"Chief\" continues to make appearances at sporting events. Does taking a walk through the horseshoe at MS or a stroll around the C-level concourse at AH really embody the spirit of loyalty, honor, and tradition the Save the Chief people are looking to preserve? I would think it would be better to have a memory of the Chief in his pre-retirement glory than the current marginalized version. But I suppose the crowds will continue to cheer as long as he shows up.  I hate the word \"Mascot\". Bucky Badger is a mascot. Brutus the Buckeye is a mascot. They dance and fire up the crowd and hold signs and mess with the cheer leaders and all that crap. They're a fun tradition of entertainment and a staple of the college football experience. Chief Illiniwek appeared for 1 song, performed the dance, lead the alma mater, and then left. He's a symbol to be revered by students so they strive to be \"the complete man\", one that is physically, intellectually, and spiritually strong... at least that was Zuppke's original intention. The tradition has NOTHING to do with the sport of football aside from being started by a coach. It has NOTHING to do with entertainment and being fun to watch and look at. It has EVERYTHING to do with the spirit and loyalty of the students, alumni, fans, and surrounding community.  The only reason we see him perform at sporting events is because there are no larger gatherings on campus of the aforementioned crowd than for those events. The routine has been altered once for aesthetic reasons since it started. The moves are visually impressive but mostly because the people lucky enough to portray the Chief study and work their asses off to get it completely perfect in order to maintain authenticity. When you see the Chief dance, you're not supposed to be pointing and laughing at the minority while wearing the headdress from shitty kids Indian Halloween costume you thought would be funny to wear drunk to the game. You're not supposed to be squinting and asking yourself \"Is that a white guy dressed up on the field?\". You're not supposed to see him as a current representation of all Native Americans. You're just supposed to be proud to be a Fighting Illini. Washington Redskins - Obviously racist. Cleveland indians, cartoony and politically incorrect. These 2 are among many others who create a disrespectful image of Native Americans. I feel that Chief Illiniwek was unjustly bundled into that group. &gt; He's a symbol to be revered by students so they strive to be \"the complete man\", one that is physically, intellectually, and spiritually strong\n\nThe \"complete man\"'s tribe got decimated by white people ... so not sure he is someone to strive towards, especially by a largely white school. The above statement is hypocritical and makes a mockery of the history of genocide. &gt; He's a symbol to be revered by students so they strive to be \"the complete man\", one that is physically, intellectually, and spiritually strong\n\nThe \"complete man\"'s tribe got decimated by white people ... so not sure he is someone to strive towards, especially by a largely white school. The above statement is hypocritical and makes a mockery of the history of genocide.    The thing that bugs me about this is the non-uniformity of it. If the NCAA and the APA agree that the use of Native American mascots is harmful and creates a \"hostile environment\", why is it that the Florida State Seminoles get to keep their mascot? Hell they even chant \"Scalp-em!\" at their sporting events which is a bit more racist than \"Chiiieeeeeefff.\" Why is that ok, but a mascot who uses traditional dances isn't?   my take on it is that anyone who adamantly argues \"bring back the chief\" is essentially saying \n\n\"it is more important I feel enthused about my school mascot, which can be argued to be institutionalized racism, than it is important that some group of people remain uninsulted.\"\n\nEven if you don't perceive it as racist (which if you don't...ughhhh) some people do. Not only people of native american descent, but people of other nationalities may feel that using a character that represents any ethnicity opens up the notion that one's nationality can be generalized with certain concepts of \"honor\" or \"heritage\" which can be insulting no matter how positive you think they might be. I agree with what you're saying, which is why I'm curious as to why people support the Chief so strongly. Thank you for your input! an example that people might understand the problem with a little bit more clearly.\n\nSuppose a public university were to be called the fighting africans and their mascot was a very tall, lean, black man who was characteristically talented at basketball.\n\nNow someone could argue \"this isn't insulting, we are praising the figure for it's talents\" which on the surface level is conceivably true, but the reality of the matter is that it reinforces stereotypes and imposes an ideology at the expense of a race.\n\nNow i'm sure some will find that example extreme, but the only reason that is, is because the conflict of White/Black relations in America is so drilled into our heads (though not enough if you ask me) that the average person tends to be more aware of what may/may not constitute a racist gesture. When it comes to concerning ourselves with the treatment of Native Americans, we are entirely uneducated. So many people feel comfortable allowing these stereotypes to be reinforced by the character, because they can say to themselves \"well, the demonstration is supposed to be positive, therefore not racist\" but that just isn't the case. an example that people might understand the problem with a little bit more clearly.\n\nSuppose a public university were to be called the fighting africans and their mascot was a very tall, lean, black man who was characteristically talented at basketball.\n\nNow someone could argue \"this isn't insulting, we are praising the figure for it's talents\" which on the surface level is conceivably true, but the reality of the matter is that it reinforces stereotypes and imposes an ideology at the expense of a race.\n\nNow i'm sure some will find that example extreme, but the only reason that is, is because the conflict of White/Black relations in America is so drilled into our heads (though not enough if you ask me) that the average person tends to be more aware of what may/may not constitute a racist gesture.

I still don't see how having the chief was racist. He only danced. If we say that it was racist or didn't accurately represent the real tribe, then where do we stop? The Chicago Bears's mascot is a bear (obviously) which is depicted as aggressive and angry, when really bears aren't really like that. So should we start a petition saying this is a bad representation of a bear and it the team needs to change its mascot? Or the Minnesota Vikings. Vikings didn't play football in the past, so why are they a mascot? If we are going to say the chief can't be allowed then EVERY mascot that is misrepresented to any extent shouldn't be allowed.

There really, truly is a difference between marginalized groups and privileged ones. I didn't use to believe this, because I grew up being told that everyone was supposed to be treated equally, regardless. But when inequality exists, and treating people \"equally\" ignores that fact, you end up with unequal consequences. Story time!\n\nI spent two years in a rural West African village, serving with the Peace Corps. The hardest part of the whole thing was the way that strangers would treat me. It's hard to explain, but they didn't treat me like a human being. I was a curiosity, or a means to an end. Sure, once people got to know me, everything was fine. I made some deeply meaningful friendships, and met some truly remarkable people. But every morning, before I opened my door, I knew that I would probably meet someone that day who treated me like less than a person, and it was exhausting.\n\nNow, there's a charming (not) custom of yelling \"white person\" at any non-African person you see. It's mostly kids that do it, and they don't mean anything by it. I can tell you, though, that it is universally reviled by the non-Africans living there. It's a big, fat reminder that you're not a person until you prove you are. That you're an Other. Most people, myself included, initially try calling back \"black person,\" hoping people will see how annoying it is. It's incredibly disappointing. Usually, the person will just smile and say \"Yeah! I'm a black person.\" Why would they be offended?  It's like saying \"Hey, you! You have two arms!\" This is a case where treating people equally produces unequal results. When people yelled my race at me, it was annoying because it was emblematic of a larger problem. When I yelled their race back, it didn't have any comparable emotional connection. It was a totally neutral statement. That's what I think of when people equate the Vikings with the Redskins.\n\ntl;dr: Stereotyping visible minorities is not the same as stereotyping a privileged class.  I'm done fighting for the Chief.  If native americans want their only legacy to be alcoholism and casinos, then so be it.   The Chief is respectful as fuck. To my knowledge he was never portrayed  in a negative light. Part of me wishes there was a school somewhere with an Asian mascot that's good at math. Pekin, IL had a high school whose teams were known as the Chinks until 1981. The Chief is respectful as fuck. To my knowledge he was never portrayed  in a negative light. Part of me wishes there was a school somewhere with an Asian mascot that's good at math.  Overcompensating for racism is just as bad as racism itself.  Could you elaborate on that a bit? There doesn't seem to be much racism in the mascot to virtually everyone, but in the name of being politically correct no one gets to enjoy the mascot because there's always those few people that get offended over nothing. From the APA article:\n\n&gt; According to Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, University of Arizona, this appears to have a negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children. \"American Indian mascots are harmful not only because they are often negative, but because they remind American Indians of the limited ways in which others see them. This in turn restricts the number of ways American Indians can see themselves.\"\n\nDo you think that their concerns are invalid/overblown? There doesn't seem to be much racism in the mascot to virtually everyone, but in the name of being politically correct no one gets to enjoy the mascot because there's always those few people that get offended over nothing.

The Chief continues to have an effect on the university even after he was removed.  I've never seen him perform, yet i have strong opinions about this. \n\nMy question is, why does the NFL have a team named the Redskins, yet we can't have a guy dress up and dance?  One is obviously much more offensive. The Chief continues to have an effect on the university even after he was removed.

Very little of the University is still funded by taxpayer money, and none of the DIA is taxpayer money. The university is a public institution regardless and should represent all citizens fairly.  What if more of its residents wish for the mascot to return? Wouldn't that be fair to the majority then? Very little of the University is still funded by taxpayer money, and none of the DIA is taxpayer money.

I have had a terrible time in Gabe's Place for the last three years. I just wanted to see if anyone else had any other horror stories to make me feel a little better. Here is the abridged version of my current problems. \n\nMy 3 room mates and I lived in the same apartment for 3 years. It was owned by this company called Gabes Place. Last summer 2012, Gabes Place was disbanded by the court for some sort of money scandal and was taken over by this company from South Carolina called Preiss MGMT. Preiss people came to U of I and opened up a parent company here under the name of University Village. University Village owns Gabes Place (they kept the name) as well as this other company called Sleep UofI. So there are basically 4 different companies under the parent name of Preiss. And they all don't communicate with each other. They also lost all of our paperwork and records. We have had to go to the bank multiple times to give them records that we paid the rent. Sometimes they will attempt to evict us or bill us by just placing a note on the door (with our bank account info) and when we call to figure things out, they just claim there is \"a system error\" or make us go back to the bank for records. This has happened multiple times within the last six months. They also changed our locks twice this summer without notice. They locked me and my room mates out without notice, we couldn't get into our apt for a day... they changed the locks at 10am when we were all out... and their office was closed until 3pm the next day. That was a good day...... And every time we call to figure things out, they are always saying we are missing payments (false) security deposits (false) or last months rent (false). And when you call the Gabes Place number, they say \"oh University Village has this info.. call them\" and when you call UV, they say \"oh Gabes Place has this info...\" and no one gets back to you. The only person who seemed competent was this woman named Megan, and she just recently left the job. My room mates and I all moved out to begin student teaching this week and they emailed us saying we are going to be evicted this week. We don't even live there anymore! \n\nOur lease also said we were to live there until December 2012. They have records of us living there until July 2013. Even when we send over the documents, it seems as if they cannot process it and completely ignore them and continue to use their \"system.\" \n\nI also had a squirrel living in my ceiling for two months that dug a hole through my ceiling above my bed. They refused to come out to fix it for the longest time. Doubtful I'll be getting any sort of security deposit back it seems...\n\nHopefully none of you had to go through such a cruddy experience, but I would like to know if anyone else had any problems with Gabe's Place or anywhere else. I hope I am not alone with this mess!  FUCK PRIESS COMPANY aka Gabes Place, UV Village, SleepUofI. I live there now and these chumps wouldnt fix the heat even when the city inspector came. They made us switch units to a shittier one for the same rent. I talked to their \"Regional Manager\" from Texas at their office and she told me to fuck off and that they can do whatever they want since I signed a lease. They also pulled the you didnt pay rent shit to me once.\n\nAccording to student legal services the buildings have been foreclosed upon. The original owner (Gabe) committed suicide after taking out massive loans with the properties as collateral. \n\nAccording to them they are running the properties for the bank and are not interested in any long term investment. They dont give any fucks. The office is run by kids. Half the windows on the first floor were broken and they didnt fix them for months. Also, have the units are empty.  Every time I attempt to go into the Gabe's Place office, there is some young sophomore undergrad working there. They have no clue, and there are boxes and just random papers lying about. I've been to the office on Moorland too. It is continuously a mess.\n\nWhat did you end up doing when they said you didn't pay the rent? They actually had a glitch when we switched units, they figured it out.\n\n The only person Ive met thats competent is the maintenance guy. Hes a decent dude. Ive talked to him and he says that they basically dont give him a budget to fix stuff. Hes also the only one for all of Gabes Place. Some girl also had her unit flood and they refused to fix it and it molded over. They also made her move into a different unit.\n\nBut yeah I went through a load of shit to get heat. Over 6 weeks of calling, going to the office, and taking every avenue possible and they didnt fix anything. Let me know if you get your deposit back. I have a gut feeling non of us are.

As you said, it isn't really Gabe's anymore.  If you have a the time to document every little communication you might chat with a lawyer or try small claims court when they try to stiff you.  I would also make sure these issues are documented at the tenant's union.  Gabe's Place was horrible when I was there and sounds worse now. Avoid at all costs.  I think I might be the only person who had a good experience renting from Gabe's place. I lived there when Gabe was still alive though and never had any major maintenance issues. They did a bunch of roof repairs once and drilled holes in my ceiling. I woke up to banging and plaster falling on my face and could see sunlight. They did fix that after I bitched. They also couldn't figure out a way to get my couch down the stairs and threw it off a balcony. I guess my standards were a bit low as a first time renter.   Contact the tenant unit, report them to the better business bureau, and/or [take them to small claims court](http://ohmyapt.apartmentratings.com/how-to-take-your-landlord-to-small-claims-court-for-violating-the-rental-agreement.html)\n\nmy apartment from university group was pretty bad...\n\n* the place was disgusting when i moved in.\n* during the winter i had to choose between the extremely expensive and inefficient heating in the apartment or huddling next to a space heater. some nights i couldnt sleep there because it was so cold.\n* there was a hole in the wall.. from my apartment i could see to the outside. i stuffed plastic bags into it until maintenance fixed it\n* for a year and half my ceiling dripped on and off. theyd come and fix it sometimes but it was always a problem. it was so bad that the back door rotted and had to be replaced. (luckily they replaced it, but then that one started rotting too.)\n* they tried to take half of my deposit for bullshit reasons, but i called and said they had to return my deposit because the lease said they couldn't keep it past 30 days. they called their lawyer and offered me part of it back. keep an eye on this, it might help.\n\nthey were no gabes place, but man i'm glad to be out of there...\n\nps. maybe you can ask for a receipt if you physically go in to drop off your rent check? That is awesome advice! Sorry your living situation was so crappy. \n\nWhat company were you renting from? And was this 30 day deposit clause in the lease? I definitely have to check that out. They said something about 45 days I'll get my deposit back or something... but I am not sure if that was just a random person making that up at the front desk. No one seems to know anything and everyone is so young/clueless.  Gabe's Place IS THE DEVIL. One time I rented there and one of the maintenance men actually shit on my pillow when I was in class and when I called the office to complain I got told to fuck off. Safe to say I never rented from those goons again.  Gabe's Place IS THE DEVIL.

Can't you get an image of the check online from your bank and e-mail that to them? Would save you the trip to the bank and then to them to drop it off.\n\nRamshaw did this to me once too (losing my rent mysteriously), but an e-mail cleared things up. I am worried about Gabes Place. We have tried the email thing as well as actually going into the bank. They are continually contacting me and my room mates about the missing money, security deposits, last months rent, and other balance issues. This has happened probably about five times now.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how to clear this mess up? I'm glad it worked out for you at Ramshw.. hmm not really anything beyond the normal. When you e-mail them the check ask for confirmation it was received, if not call them the next day to check if it got to the right person. My guess is they're just disorganized and the person who says the money is missing didn't get the image (or lost it if they're a little incompetent). \n\nEach time I send an e-mail to them I would include the record of what happened in the past. Something like:\n\n1. March's rent was lost and I had to get a copy of the (on-time) cashed check from the bank.\n\n2. May's rent was lost and I had to get a copy of the (on-time) cashed check from the bank.\n\n3.

That's for me to do. :) This.  Thanks a bunch, this response is great!  I've already emailed someone from the stats dept., and he got right back to me and said they'd look into it and get back to me soon, so I think I'll give them a day or so to do so.  If I don't get a good response by then, I'll try what you suggested, and see what that does for me.  But seeing as this class is literally required for me to graduate, I should hope that I'll be able to get back in. Well, I sent the passive-aggressive email either way. :) Haha, thank you!\n\nEDIT:  So I stopped by the stat office this afternoon and was told that the seats are reserved for new stats majors this semester, and that they don't make any exceptions to that.  Basically, they just said to wait until the restriction is lifted and hope that there are still seats left.\n\nGreat. Did they say when it would be lifted, or how you can see when it is lifted? The woman I spoke with would only say to keep trying, and that it would be lifted once the new students have finished registering (which is currently happening now, apparently.)\n\nAlso, I haven't heard back from the gentleman that I emailed, so maybe that will get something accomplished.  I really don't know. Good luck! The stat department set up Reserved Seats in Stat 420.

Usually it's armed robbery of some sort.\n\n\n\nMy question is, why don't houses/apartments get wildly broken into over Holiday breaks?  There are so many decrepit houses around town with obviously no security systems.  One solid kick to a backdoor would get a criminal in the house, and he'd probably come out with a flatscreen TV or two, maybe a few gaming systems, a guitar, several printers, whatever.  Campus is relatively dead for three weeks, ya know?\n\n\n\nObviously I'm not condoning it or recommending it.  I just want to know why it doesn't (knock on wood, I'm not back yet!) seem to happen.\n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry to all who have been robbed over breaks.  Thanks for sharing your stories - I guess it happens more than one may realize in any city, not just Champaign.   My apartment was robbed over thanksgiving break  My apartment was robbed over thanksgiving break   I've known two people who had their places broken in to and two who were mugged on campus.  By comparison, in my nice, rich, upscale suburb, I've had my house broken in to and know three people who have been mugged.\n\nCrime really *isn't* a problem on campus.  It's not that bad.  But when you're living in Naperville, Skokie, Elgin, Schaumburg, etc, you don't get emails when someone is robbed at gunpoint.  You only think it's bad because you hear about it 1000x more than you do back in your suburb. Really? Suscribe to every block in the CITY and deal with all the robberies mugging and rape. There is a lot more than suburanites see going on. WhileI was at school people were getting shot around the corner fron my house.    Casing a place to figure out it is empty, then searching a place for valuables, then selling the valuables requires a lot of planning and calm deliberation.\n\nWandering around armed and angry until you finally snap at some kid, who looks like they have it made, to take their cash, requires no planning or calm deliberation. &gt; Wandering around armed and angry until you finally snap at some kid\n\nWhy do you think anger is a prerequisite? I think they rob because they want money, not because they are generally angry.   I had my place robbed on Christmas day.  Luckily a roommate was home, the robber only got my xbox and a 12 pack of Rolling Rock.  My roommate called the police and they brought the k-9 unit.  The k-9 unit was able to track the thief to his place and the police arrested him.  Still took over a fucking year to get my Xbox back since it was evidence.  lots of places get robbed during breaks actually. The reporting is kept to a minimum, either people don't report or it's not widely known. There's a lot of bad stuff that happens on campus actually...some of it is swept under the rug...bad publicity for the university... Go on My roommate was assaulted by five kids at fifth and green with a knock to the back of the head. Luckily the cops were there to witness it and immediately chased the kids away so he wasn't robbed. You would imagine a through report would be taken, but the officer did not even take my roommate's name or anything. I even asked the officer for his name and he said something along the lines of, \"Do you want me to stand here talking to you or do you want me to catch these guys.\" There were other police already on the scene so I wasn't buying the excuse. The next  day we followed up with the police department and there was no record of the event. We tried filing a report over the phone but were told that we could not until the night shift was back on duty. A police report was finally filled when I took my roommate to the hospital to check out his concussion. Shit like this use to be prime crime alert fodder. This led me to believe that these types of crimes were still happening and it pissed me off that the campus community is not aware.

If I understand correctly, the professor could 'close' the course preventing open registrations. They can then 'override' the system and add students. Ah...that's cool...Thanks! Technically, AFAIK, a professor can add students to a course in any situation that they want. I've often gotten into closed courses by asking nicely.

What groups are you in, r/uiuc?"}, {"snippet": "As the semester starts I'm sure many of you are wondering how you can get books without forking over a fortune for texts. Here are a few tips to save you some dough I've learned over the past 3.5 years as a student from a low-income family:\n\n* 1) All instructors are required to make texts available on reserve (usually at the main stacks or ugl). If the instructor is giving you a BS \"invest in your education\" response or is resisting to do so in any way explain how not putting the book on reserve (either in a library or on e-reserves) is an act of discrimination against low income students. **Be polite in emails** and go above your professor only if they refuse to put something on reserve.\n\n* 2) Use our library system! There are usually a few copies of smaller books/novels in one of the over 20 libraries on campus. Check early before the semester starts and you can renew a book up to 4 times (that's 14 weeks).\n\n* 3) Use the I-SHARE system (http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/all/vf/). You can use your UIUC Library account to access this. Basically how this works is you search a database of university libraries in Illinois for books you need. If you find it, and you usually will, you can request the book to be sent to UIUC's main stacks where you can check it out. You can renew up to 4 times with these books as well.\n\n* 4) Help yourself and other Illini by using the Illini Book Exchange (http://www.illinibookexchange.com/splash.php5). Here you can buy and sell used texts (this is especially nice for harder to find math/science/engineering texts).\n\n* 5) Rent you texts! You can do this at one of the local greedy textbook shops or online through various websites (Amazon, Chegg, etc..). Shop around for the cheapest rate for a semester.\n\n* 6) If you absolutely need to buy a text, don't go to Follets, TIS, or the Union Bookstore unless you can't find cheaper options online. These stores are convenient but are almost always incredibly expensive.\n\n* 7) Buy or rent older editions of textbooks. Many professors write the books for their classes and require students to buy the most up to date edition. 9 out of 10 times these new editions are just scams to get more money. Most professors will be honest when you ask if an older edition is okay, so be sure to ask. If they say you need the newest edition (usually a response if they wrote the book), ask exactly why. Chances are the old one will work just fine.\n\n* 8) Share texts with friends. If you need to buy an expensive text, share the financial burden with someone else! A $150 text isn't as daunting when you split it with a friend. Just be sure to create a fair plan for who uses the book when (this can lead to conflict near exam time).\n\n* 9) Thank your professors/TA's who make every effort to get texts on reserves and help you find the cheapest option. It is always refreshing to meet a university instructor who actually cares about you as a student.\n\n* Hope these help! Please comment with any additional tips. \n  10) PDFs. And if you can't find them, make your own!  The IUB has a pretty generous return period (this semester, it should be Jan 26), I have a scanner that I made myself that I use.  I can do roughly two textbooks an hour.   Just a disclaimer, this is almost always a violation of copyright law, even if you're not sharing it with anyone else. Am well aware.  But thanks!  \n\nEdit:  Whoever downvoted jmurphy42 needs to learn reddiquette.  Just because you disagree with copyright laws doesn't mean you should take it out on him, nor that you should hide the information presented.  If anything, you're making it worse for everyone.

I can do roughly two textbooks an hour.   You made a book scanner?

You just gotta find it. I've been able to torrent 90% of my books for ECE  What site do you go to? What site do you go to?  http://www.abebooks.com is also a good site for international editions. Abe Books is great for international editions. Same book for about 90% less cost.       I'm going to take issue with #3.  You say \"you usually will\" find the book in I-Share, but that's misleading.  I'm a librarian who regularly helps students search I-Share for their textbooks, and your odds of finding them in the catalog are only a little better than 50/50.  Once you've found it, the majority of the time it'll be unrequestable from the library that owns it (either it's permanently unrequestable, they have it in course reserves themselves, or it's already checked out).  \n\nI'm not saying not to *try* getting your books through I-Share, just that it's not going to have a high rate of success and you pretty much have to do it as soon as you can find out what textbooks you need.

Can you give me an example of what you're referring to? I worked for the UI Foundation (called alumni and asked for donations) and believe me, people are still irate at the Chief and it hurts our donations considerably.

"}, {"snippet": "So I am a skinny guy, always have been, and I know that I need to gain weight. Currently, especially with my spring schedule, it will be hard to truly dedicate myself to a decent program, but I have to try. I was going to try to do the Stronglifts 5x5, or perhaps starting strength, but since most of the exercises involved free weights (squats, Benches, OHP) I would definitely need to go either ARC or CRCE. \n\nFirst off, which is better for these types of exercises; ARC or CRCE? I am currently at FAR/PAR as well.\n\nSecond, you generally need a spotter for certain exercises. Anyone have experience as a super skinny person not lifting much at all (tbh, I am not sure I could even bench the bar by itself) how easy would it be to get a decent spot? And are there people who bench not a lot that usually, or would I just look ridiculous?\n\nThanks  I have worked out at both ARC (2 years) and CRCE (1.5 years) in my 3.5 years here, and they both have pro's and con's.\n\nARC as a facility is much better than CRCE, having deadlift platforms, abundant free weights, and rubber plates (which are nice to have for deadlifts, since you need to do those for SL5x5).  But, the facility is generally much more crowded than CRCE will be.\n\nCRCE on the other hand has more basic equipment, shying away from being powerlift friendly (deadlifts, cleans, squats) due to the lack of padding/platforms/rubber plates, as well as there only being 1 squat rack.  But, it's less crowded, and you can manage to do all the lifts you need for SL5x5 with some effort.\n\nSince you are at FAR/PAR, I would probably say CRCE, because going all the way to ARC during the Winter is a hassle.  22N Illini takes 20 minutes there, which adds a total of 40 minutes to your workouts.\n\nIf I recall, SL5x5 has deadlifts, squats, bench, a freeweight press and something else... I can't remember.  For deadlifts, you can choose to do them outside the squat rack if you'd like.  Just grab 2 yoga mats, fold them into thirds, and place them under each weight area of the bar.  As for bench, since you don't think you can use the bar itself, use the Smith Machine.  It's right next to the squat rack and you can spot yourself with just the twist of your wrists.  Although, I suggest moving away from the Smith Machine once you feel comfortable, because using it does not develop stability muscles that you need.\n\nLike some of the other people have already said, good luck, and set some goals for yourself.  I've seen a guy workout 6 months straight without seeing any gains, but my current workout partner also put on 30 lbs of muscle in 3 months.  Be safe, but push your limits.\n\nTL;DR I recommend CRCE, just look at my 5th paragraph for my suggestions as to how to do some of the lifts SL5x5 requires.  Good luck! 30lbs of muscle in 3 months...sorry but no. Granted, 5-7 lbs of his weight gain was water weight from creatine, and his lean muscle gain was measured using caliper fat tests compared to his current body weight, so yeah you're probably right, his gains were more likely near the 18-22 lb area, but massive gains like that aren't unheard of.\n\nWe're also talking about someone who went from not doing any leg workouts to doing ATG squats twice a week..  Hit up the ARC. Trust me, it's worth the bus ride (or walk when the weather is nice).\n\nIt's nice to see fellow lifters at UIUC. Check out the Illini Bodybuilding Club if you're looking for a great lifting community and/or a lifting partner. It's an RSO that I started. I am interested in this. Is there a set place when/where you guys meet up? Hit up the ARC. Trust me, it's worth the bus ride (or walk when the weather is nice).\n\nIt's nice to see fellow lifters at UIUC. Check out the Illini Bodybuilding Club if you're looking for a great lifting community and/or a lifting partner. It's an RSO that I started. Do they do a \"getting started\" type thing? I'm aiming to start Starting Strength this semester but I'm worried about form.  You need to do it at the ARC. There are no deadlift platforms at CRCE. You only need a spot for bench and even then, you probably won't because you can just swing the bar down and put it on your legs if you fail. You would look ridiculous but nobody gives a shit. Everybody starts somewhere and we've all been there. Although I'm self conscious if I'm not doing 135. People deadlift in the CRCE squat rack all the time. Just dont be like Joebrah and slam your weight down after every rep (unless, like Joebrah, you're doing 4+ plates).  Lol, gotta love Joebrah! I actually lifted with him one summer. It was a lot of fun. HAHA People know him by Joebrah?  I thought only a few people called him that :P.  I should ask him if he's a redditor, he'd love this :P.
