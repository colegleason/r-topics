You are quoted as saying: \"\u201cI would say 99 percent of my constituency, those who have contacted me, is against gay marriage...My job is to represent my constituents and uphold what they believe.\u201d\n\nFirst, exaggeration fools nobody. It is statistically impossible that so many of your constituents agree with you, especially in county that voted heavily Democrat in the previous Presidential election. You know this.

Safety first and don't be a dumbass, I don't want to see any of you awesome dudes in hospital or handcuffs.\n\n2. If you are under 21, stay away from Green street, its crawling with cops and you can't get into bars now.\n\n3. If you can, buy alcohol off campus. Its significantly cheaper. If you're &lt; 21 and looking for someone to buy for you, ask someone to buy today or early tomorrow, nobody is going to want to buy stuff for other people on Friday.\n\n4. Walk in groups. Crime happens, and there's no easier target than a lone drunkard. Know the numbers of the campus PD and saferides/walks \n\n5. [this](http://i.imgur.com/rdIBH.jpg) gives some great help for dealing with cops and general safety (thanks /u/Helpful_guy).\n\n***\n\n&gt; Being drunk doesn't mean your behavior gets excused by everyone.\n\n\n&gt; Pace yourself. Eat lots. Don't forget about drinking water every once in a while to stay hydrated.\n\n\n&gt; Dont do simple dumb things, remember the age old rule \"Do one illegal thing at a time\" aka dont j-walk, climb shit, litter, etc.\n\n\n&gt; Another big thing is if you have a party to make sure no randoms are coming in. I was at a house party that was busted at Polar Bear (SIUC) this winter and the undercover cop was a woman posing as a sorostitute (minding she was a solid 8.5) so don't assume that kind of trickery does not happen here.\n\n\n&gt; I don't have any tips but the people who really lick their chops over unofficial are the tow truck drivers.

We took a day trip to Miyajima where we saw SO MANY DEER and got to climb (for many of us) our first mountain.

May have to do with the construction of the IMAX(I guess BIGD) portion of the theater. Maybe the phase they are in is not suitable to do business. It's supposed to be a major rebuild.     On the bright side, now that it's closed, no one will get shot there! Beverly is notoriously shady. \nSource: I'm a townie On the bright side, now that it's closed, no one will get shot there!

Boxing. I know a few people that were on my high school team that want to start one. Tough to get started because you need a gym to train but it is a great sport.  I remember hearing people talking about wanting to start one up, but they were getting some flak from the university for it. We can have a group for every political belief on the planet, every stance on religion, every viewpoint ever. But we cannot have a club that promotes exercising and physical health. The logic is very flawed (unless you consider the constitution but still) . Sure there is a lot of head trauma in boxing but that is in actual fights. You rarely ever get put on your ass training. I see more injuries in football than I do in boxing. Yeah, go figure.  I think the rationale was that it wasn't \"cultured\" enough or some bs like that.

I see more injuries in football than I do in boxing. In football you have people paid to professionally monitor it all. With Boxing it may be that the school feels that if someone sustains(just one person) a serious injury......the school would be blamed.  The University is not affiliated with any RSO's on campus. If someone were to get injured during boxing the head of the RSO and its board members would be held accountable. All you have to do is make the members sign a contract saying that the RSO will not be held accountable and the the participants accepts all risks. Same thing I had to do in high school for boxing. Though while they have legal distance, anything done by their students on school property still comes back to them. Though there probably still is more to it though.

How is Orchard South? I would not recommend Orchard South. Depending on where you live in OS, the laundry building could be 4 blocks away. If you want to live in OD, choose an apartment close to one of the two laundry buildings. If you are going to be here for a couple of years, something on-campus like Goodwin-Green, or something with one of the better landlords (Advantage, Bailey) might be a better idea with regard to ease of getting to classes, being on several bus routes, etc.\n\nHowever, if you are an international student, depending on the country you are from, Orchard Downs might be a better place to stay if you don't know anyone here or there aren't many people from your country.

It may or may not be nicer in terms of the rental units, but it is also more expensive and gets a nasty rumble every few minutes from passing freight. How much is it for a room at Indigo Place? Looks highend.... I think its between 300-500 ish per room, depending on the number of rooms. I have a 3 bedroom to myself (with my wife) for about 1100 a month. This works out to less than 400/room. Oh, ok. Not as expensive as I thought it would be. The reviews I've seen online are a mixed bag, some people are really pleased with the place, others loathe it.

Hey, I was one of those guys! \n\nYes, we're checking all the keyboards (and I mean fucking all of them) just to double triple check that there are no more keyloggers in any of our keyboards. We're then putting sweet tamper proof stickers on all of them so we know in the future if they've been opened up. \n\nSomeone said it below, but I'll just confirm what he said so you all know. The thermal gun is used because we're checking for imbedded keyloggers. When you look at a keyboard, you'll see a hotspot at the keyboard controller (as /u/NegatedVoid said, all electronics produce heat when operating). We're looking for another obvious hotspot which would be a keylogger.  How much is the gun?  It'd be cool for Internet cafes. I think about $5K. Kinda of cool but hella expensive, haha. \n\nEdit: \n\nWe borrowed it from one of the engineering departments. No way does Engineering IT have that much expendable cash xD Sure you do. Just don't upgrade your servers for 3 years. Bam! $15k to blow on hookers and a infrared gun. :-P\n\nNo, but really: I bet the F&amp;S guys have them really nice ones too so they can find leaks in the steam lines.\n\nAdditionally, couldn't you find likely targets via the additional current required? If it's putting off detectable amounts of heat, it's gotta bump the power consumption out of spec. mA required is passed over the USB bus IIRC.  What? How do they use thermal imaging to check for keyloggers? We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating. I have a hard time imagining someone opening up all those keyboards and splicing in keyloggers, but I suppose someone has to check. I'd be more concerned with someone planting a device on the ethernet cable, between the computers and the outlet.\n\nAlso surprised that the keyloggers would generate enough heat, relative to room temperature, to be seen through the keyboard. That's exactly how his keyloggers worked. He opened up a keyboard and then soldered in the keylogger to the controller. It generates heat because its an electronic device, hooked up to power. Oh, and the thermal gun we're using is extremely sensitive. \n\nThe other device you speak of I think is a lot more obvious to find and know about (from the server side). I think from our end we would know if a device like that was hooked up to a computer's ethernet jack.   How you found any more of this dudes key loggers? Also I was at one of the computers while you took a pic of the keyboard. That gun was pretty cool That's exactly how his keyloggers worked. He opened up a keyboard and then soldered in the keylogger to the controller. It generates heat because its an electronic device, hooked up to power. Oh, and the thermal gun we're using is extremely sensitive. \n\nThe other device you speak of I think is a lot more obvious to find and know about (from the server side). I think from our end we would know if a device like that was hooked up to a computer's ethernet jack.   &gt; He opened up a keyboard and then soldered in the keylogger to the controller.\n\nThat seems like a ridiculous amount of risk. How many of these things did he manage to plant? I have a hard time imagining someone opening up all those keyboards and splicing in keyloggers, but I suppose someone has to check. I'd be more concerned with someone planting a device on the ethernet cable, between the computers and the outlet.\n\nAlso surprised that the keyloggers would generate enough heat, relative to room temperature, to be seen through the keyboard. We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating. This seems like such inefficient and probably ineffective way to check for hardware keyloggers. All electronics give off a little heat. They'd be able to see an unusual heat source inside the keyboard (remember, they probably own a buhzillion of the same keyboards).\n\nI think it'd be much less efficient to actually go around opening them all up. As another poster said, now they're putting tamper-proof stickers on them so they won't have to image again. Huh. I didn't know there was such a thing as a keylogger inside of a keyboard. That wouldn't help against something [like this one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Keylogger-hardware-PS2-example-connected.jpg/175px-Keylogger-hardware-PS2-example-connected.jpg) though. Right, but they can simply order EWS staff to check for them on a regular basis. Perhaps they already do.\n\nThe tamper proof stickers would have to be checked, too. This seems like such inefficient and probably ineffective way to check for hardware keyloggers. We're talking about hardware keyloggers.\n\nI'm assuming they're checking for keyboards that have had one embedded in them. All electronics produce some heat when operating.  ATTENTION. Please Upvote this so people can SEE.\n\nI know these guys probably checked this as well, but whenever you use the computers PLEASE make sure to check the back of the computers to where the keyboard connects to see if there is an attached keylogger. There are many hardware keyloggers that people plug into the USB port and then plug the keyboard into that.\n\nSO if you think anything is weird with how the keyboard is connected....DON'T USE IT  So who is this ECE hacker? Sorry I guess I haven't been keeping up with uiuc news. I know there was some ece hacker like 2 months ago. Is it the same guy? Yep, same guy. Same guy who cancelled that ECE class last semester, glued a professor's/administrator's door shut, and put keyloggers in a bunch of computers in Everitt. \n\nDo some searching on this sub for \"ECE Hacker\" and you'll find the threads. \n\nThe TL;DR is: Guy did stupid shit. Guy thought he was smart shit. Guy got shit on by campus security and FBI. Guy got arrested. Guy posted bail. Guy awaiting trial.  So how did he get the professor's password(s) with keyloggers in the EWS keyboards? So how did he get the professor's password(s) with keyloggers in the EWS keyboards?  So what about software sided keyloggers. It's not that hard to add yourself to the sudoers file and be able to install a daemon keylogger.  Actually on EWS, at least its my understanding that its a pain in the ass to edit the sudoers file.\n\nBesides, you would be crazy to try it. Our linux admin is like a hawk with X-ray vision.

Is it beneficial to be a part of a sorority or a waste of time? From what I know about the university, it's pretty big into Greek life. Are most people on campus involved in it? Any thoughts? \n   I feel like I can help out a lot here. I'm a physics major and in a house. Seeing as my classes are mainly guys I wanted a way that I could make friends with a lot of girls. I know a lot of people will talk about how being in a house is a \"waste of time\" but its not. Most sororities will have test files where you can look at notes, quizzes, labs, exams and all sorts of helpful information from semesters before. This has helped me out a great deal with homework for whenever I seem to get stuck. The other thing that most people don't understand is that you have to hit a minimum gpa to be in a house. The girls all want you to succeed and so homework and exams will always come before sorority life. \n\nNot even just the school life, but being in a sorority is a great place for networking. I have been offered jobs and promotions from other sisters who are no longer in college. The opportunities gained from being in a house alone makes it worth it. \n\nThis university is really big on greek life, and on a campus a large as our school, being in a house will honestly make the campus feel smaller. I have made so many friends in other houses (both sorority and frat) and its nice being able to walk around campus and run into people you know. \n\nFrats and sororities are super involved in volunteering and raising money for various causes. Most people know little about this. We raised over $10,000 in a semester for our philanthropy. Not to mention we go and read to children every week as well as other supplemental things like working in soup kitchens, clothing drives, and habitat for humanity trips.\n\nNot to mention but being in a house is just fun. We do a lot of activities together like sit down hang out and watch movies, pull pranks on each other, going out, random walmart runs, getting ready for events together and so much more. We're all normal human beings, we just happen to live in a house together. \n\nThere are so many different houses on campus, 18 now and a possibility of 19 next year. There is a unique personality to each house and if its something you're interested in you're bound to fit into one of them! Worst case scenario you can always go through rush, discover that you don't like it and drop. You can even join a house and if its not what you were hoping for (don't get along with the girls, not enough time, decide its not for you, whatever) you can drop. That's the thing, as much as it is a \"commitment\" no one is forcing you do to anything you don't like. \n\nWith that being said, it is a time commitment, at first. The first year you are in the house you will be the most involved. You will have new member meetings, initiation and a lot of other things. As time goes on the house takes up less of your time.

But they're all wrong, because first of all, there are still plenty of great people in top houses, they just aren't seen as much.

What's your house's minimum GPA, out of curiosity? \n\nThe job network is rather convenient and does have obvious benefits. However, if you are smart with your connections (which I am not, sadly), you can network in a similar way you could with a fraternity or sorority. Talk to professors, take advantage of research opportunities, get involved in your department.

It is nice that greek life contributes to \"supplemental things\", but if those \"things\" are really important to you then you shouldn't need to join greek life to participate. Anyone can work in a soup kitchen or run a clothing drives. (Plus, I still firmly believe that habitat for humanity is just a way for a bunch of spoiled kids to have a morally fulfilling vacation in a town. There is nothing unemployed people in New Orleans can't to do build a house that your sorority can, sorry. If anything you're just stealing the jobs and local resources they have.)\n\nThe whole fun paragraph is nothing unique to greek life at all. I guess that was the point of typing it out, but chilling, pranking, buying shit, and pregaming are normal parts of college lifestyle for everyone. However, something not everyone has is the vindictive jealousy that goes with sorority sisters within their own house and at girls in other houses. So be wary of that.\n\nI'm not anti-greek. I have a lot of friends in top houses and I know it's a big part of life here. But I *hate* how the information they give out to draw in new members is skewed. The best piece of advice heander gave you, OP, was give it a try. See if you like it, but be aware that very few girls ever drop out of a pledge class and I don't really want to imagine how their ex-pledge sisters are to them. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Congrats on your acceptance.  I don't disagree with you iam0594. You made a lot of good points! But at the same time any time a person gives their opinion on a subject it will be skewed. I have a bias to being in a sorority because I love being in a house. \n\nI agree that the university is not on top of their game when it comes to \"cheating\" but I know of people who have access to old tests and quizzes just like I do, but instead of getting it from sisters or brothers they get information from friends. I have several GDI friends who pass around all of their information from previous semesters to their friends. How is that any different? I'm just explaining that being in a house has helped me with my school work. My house has a min. GPA of 2.6 (I think?) but some houses have a 3.0 requirement. \n\nWhen it comes to philanthropy when we raised money last semester it was from dinners, ice cream bar and a football tournament. All the money raised was from other students on campus. We weren't asking for donations from our alumni. And I never said that you had to join a house to volunteer and raise money, its just one of that added perks of being in a house. \n\nThe fun paragraph isn't unique to greek life. I completely agree with you on that one, but it is something that I love about being in my house. Any time someone wants you to join a club they're going to list out the benefits of being in a club. This is no different with me and my house. I love the volunteering aspect, I love hanging out, I love being able to go ask older girls in the house for help with school. While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek. \n\nYou are also correct, very few girls drop out once they're actually in the house. Where most girls drop out is during the actual rush experience.  &gt; While you may call it skewed, I'm just explaining why I love being greek.\n\nRight, and I totally get and appreciate that. I'm not trying to bash you or sorority lifestyles at all. \n\nI'm pretty sure that you'd agree with me that in order for someone in a house to get access to previous tests and homeworks is much easier than it is for someone not in a house. So I guess in a way the main reason they are different is because of how readily available you have access to material you shouldn't. I know lots of people end up with stuff like that anyways and that professors usually change their material to prevent that from being an issue, but I feel like it's more implicit within a house. And not like that's necessarily a bad thing, I could use some answers for my engineering classes myself. But it is present and that's that.\n\nI'm very critical of philanthropy anyways so sorry to sound like I was attacking you on that. \n\nAnd yeah absolutely on you just listing the good sides of joining a sorority. If my sister were to come here and want to join a sorority I would likely tell her she absolutely should. I don't have broad, generalized notions anything against the people in them at all. Sorry if I came of as harsh! I was just defending why I love being in my house, but I can come off too strong to often!  Nope, you were one of the most respectable posters I've seen on here. I refuse to accept your apology.  Can I ask why we're banning Moruitelda? They had an [internet fight](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18sncm/ruiuc_where_do_you_feel_unsafe_around_campus/c8hu294). Juicy. They should fight irl. I'd watch.

The best piece of advice heander gave you, OP, was give it a try. See if you like it, but be aware that very few girls ever drop out of a pledge class and I don't really want to imagine how their ex-pledge sisters are to them. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Congrats on your acceptance.  This needs a counter point pretty badly because it's rather skewed.\n\nFirst of all, don't glorify the fact that greek systems are essentially access to a cheating pyramid. The fact that the university doesn't crack down on what is obviously cheating is beyond me. Frats/sororities do not hold to any standard of academic integrity at all. And the minimum GPA is not something all that hard to keep.It's not like you feel pressured to keep that GPA. What's your house's minimum GPA, out of curiosity? \n\nThe job network is rather convenient and does have obvious benefits. However, if you are smart with your connections (which I am not, sadly), you can network in a similar way you could with a fraternity or sorority. Talk to professors, take advantage of research opportunities, get involved in your department. This is a great college and the staff here are well connected in their fields.\n\nDon't start the whole philanthropic causes thing. First of all, a good portion of that money comes from alumn or people outside of the house. It is nice that greek life contributes to \"supplemental things\", but if those \"things\" are really important to you then you shouldn't need to join greek life to participate. Anyone can work in a soup kitchen or run a clothing drives. (Plus, I still firmly believe that habitat for humanity is just a way for a bunch of spoiled kids to have a morally fulfilling vacation in a town. There is nothing unemployed people in New Orleans can't to do build a house that your sorority can, sorry. If anything you're just stealing the jobs and local resources they have.)\n\nThe whole fun paragraph is nothing unique to greek life at all. I guess that was the point of typing it out, but chilling, pranking, buying shit, and pregaming are normal parts of college lifestyle for everyone. However, something not everyone has is the vindictive jealousy that goes with sorority sisters within their own house and at girls in other houses. So be wary of that.\n\nI'm not anti-greek.

Congrats on your acceptance.  I feel like I can help out a lot here. I'm a physics major and in a house. Seeing as my classes are mainly guys I wanted a way that I could make friends with a lot of girls. I know a lot of people will talk about how being in a house is a \"waste of time\" but its not. Most sororities will have test files where you can look at notes, quizzes, labs, exams and all sorts of helpful information from semesters before. This has helped me out a great deal with homework for whenever I seem to get stuck. The other thing that most people don't understand is that you have to hit a minimum gpa to be in a house. The girls all want you to succeed and so homework and exams will always come before sorority life. \n\nNot even just the school life, but being in a sorority is a great place for networking. I have been offered jobs and promotions from other sisters who are no longer in college. The opportunities gained from being in a house alone makes it worth it. \n\nThis university is really big on greek life, and on a campus a large as our school, being in a house will honestly make the campus feel smaller. I have made so many friends in other houses (both sorority and frat) and its nice being able to walk around campus and run into people you know. \n\nFrats and sororities are super involved in volunteering and raising money for various causes. Most people know little about this. We raised over $10,000 in a semester for our philanthropy. Not to mention we go and read to children every week as well as other supplemental things like working in soup kitchens, clothing drives, and habitat for humanity trips.\n\nNot to mention but being in a house is just fun. We do a lot of activities together like sit down hang out and watch movies, pull pranks on each other, going out, random walmart runs, getting ready for events together and so much more. We're all normal human beings, we just happen to live in a house together. \n\nThere are so many different houses on campus, 18 now and a possibility of 19 next year. There is a unique personality to each house and if its something you're interested in you're bound to fit into one of them! Worst case scenario you can always go through rush, discover that you don't like it and drop. You can even join a house and if its not what you were hoping for (don't get along with the girls, not enough time, decide its not for you, whatever) you can drop. That's the thing, as much as it is a \"commitment\" no one is forcing you do to anything you don't like. \n\nWith that being said, it is a time commitment, at first. The first year you are in the house you will be the most involved. You will have new member meetings, initiation and a lot of other things. As time goes on the house takes up less of your time. Also it is expensive to be in a house. Living in is not cheap (about the same price as the dorms) and there are also dues. But there are dues for any club you join. \n\nI love being in my house, and while I know that most redditors are anti-greek I think you need to just experience it for yourself and then decide.

I'm not in a sorority (dropped after the first day of recruitment, too much \"ra ra sisterhood\" for me), but one of my best friends is. Her biggest complaint to me is that her sisters get kinda catty and jealous if she hangs out with non-house members too often. I personally need lots of time alone. I don't know your personality, but it seems like theres always something you have to participate in in a sorority, which sounds like hell to me. I think that all depends on the house! My house encourages hanging out with non house members. We like being individuals, and by joining other clubs and hanging out with other friends you do just that. Just because you join a house doesn't mean that those girls have to be you're only friends.          It depends on what type of person you are. There are alpha-girl (ultra bitchy, extremely attractive) sororities and there are more average-joe girl sororities. If you can get along with these girls and want to spend a lot of your time with them, +12,000$$, go for it.\n I only know of one sorority that's that expensive. For the most part, they run from $3000-$6000/yr Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n Just a guess but I assume he meant in aggregate.\n ($3k-$6k/year) * 4 years = $12k+\n\n It depends on what type of person you are.

If you can get along with these girls and want to spend a lot of your time with them, +12,000$$, go for it.\n Not sure why all the downvotes, probably just butthurt alpha-girls. Your implication is absolutely right though: more unique, interesting women that can carry stimulating conversation are probably best not conforming to Greek Life, while averagely interesting or egotistical girls will probably benefit greatly from it. The same can be said for men. It is a masturbational system at its core.  Please keep in mind that your experience with one sorority should NOT be generalized with how other sororities are like.\n\nGive it a shot, the people in my fraternity are incredibly close to me. If the fit is right, these people become your best friends. Without Greek life, I would have lost a huge part of my support system and would have stressed myself out and dropped out of college. It's so great for relieving work stress.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have just as many friends out of Greek life as I do in Greek life, but when you get to know upperclassmen and older students, you have a MASSIVE source of academically and socially experienced people. They really help you see things that you wouldn't have otherwise with your freshman friends in dorms.\n\nAnd for those wondering about the GPA argument, here is your source for GPA grade reports.\nhttp://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/ifcGrades.asp I find the lower table more interesting - the All Female Undergraduate Student GPA is higher than the All Male Undergraduate Student GPA by 0.22, which is quite a big difference IMO.  I do see that to be really interesting actually, I didn't notice that earlier. What do you think the reason for that is?\n\nI want to believe it has (in part) something to do with the gender breakdown in engineering and other liberal arts majors. Thoughts anyone?

Also, the idea that non-greek people are inherently jealous of you because know other greek people is false. \n I agree. Personally, I think it's a lot cooler to make your friends based on interest/personality rather than buy them. But I'm an unpopular god damn independent person so what do I know.  You don't buy your friends when you join greek life. The money goes towards benefiting both the individual and the community. But you wouldn't know that because you probably just judge it based on the actions of a few stupid frat boys and a few catty sorority girls who don't accurately represent greek life as a whole. Well, I chose not to pursue that lifestyle. You don't think kids join that bologna to make new friends when they come to school? It's the same reason people join clubs is to meet new people but they usually don't have to shove out a couple grand for it every so often. However, yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about after being here around these people for six years, having dated someone in a frat, and being friends with people from frats and sororities. God, I'm an idiot! Get a life, me.  I didn't say its for everyone or blame you for not joining it. I didnt tell you to get a life. I was simply pointing out that you are make a rude false assumption about something you aren't apart of.

If you're not majoring in engineering consider a less expensive university because UI isn't worth it for kineseology. Almost 50% of my (very large) fraternity is in engineering. Another chunk is MCB. Our house GPA is above the average GPA of non-Greeks on campus - in fact most houses are, and it's in the top third of the school for Greek life.\n\nGet off your high horse, some people just know how to manage their time to include these things.

I'd say if you're into constant run-ins with new people and making lots of acquaintances then six pack should be fun even though you don't drink. Also location of classes might be a big factor in where you live. They're both pretty far from everything though. Allen hall is great because of it's people, and the events/lectures that take place within it. So are the classes and music rooms that they have too. Also, ground south is for lovers.

Just live in the six-prack.\nFor your dorms I appreciate the effort and love the show, but as a heads up novelty accounts don't work well on smaller subreddits It's okaay to have a little bit of the sweet berry wine from time to time.  Just live in the six-prack.\nFor your dorms       Being a sophomore here who doesn't drink, any building you will be in will have people drinking.  I lived in private housing and got lucky that my roommates really didn't drink in the room often, but regardless of where you are, the booze will follow.   Yeah I'm fine being around alcohol, it's not like I'm afraid of it or anything. It's just that I want to be able to have a good time without it, and I'm wondering if that's possible at six pack.    ISR is fine\n If a little smelly. Smelly? What?  LIVE IN ALLEN. No matter what, it's far superior to any other dorm.  It's this awesome community.   I haven't lived in either of those places, but my general experience is that people don't care whether you drink/smoke or not, and are certainly not going to shun you if you don't. Just have a good attitude and don't judge others for doing so, and after some time it will cease to be as big a deal as you are imagining it to be.

It's not like we get to go to games for free. Couple thoughts.  First of all, I agree with you, lots of students work their asses of with extracurricular activities.  And I think the football palum who said something along the lines of 'try walking a day in our shoes' gives current and former U of I athletes a bad name.  I'm fully aware that loads of people would have gladly worked their asses off to compete for U of I.  \n\nThe difference that I think is pretty important to note in regards to working/extracurricular vs sports is the time myself and many other athletes missed in the classroom.  I regularly had to miss classes/exams for competitions, hence the reason the DIA provides us with tutors.  With that said, I also regularly attended office hours too.  As a track athlete, I knew getting a degree was more important to my future than sports. \n\nAs far as Illini Athletics, the quick source I pulled from '09 said:\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget. \n\nwhich seems to show it's not quite as shaky as you're implying, those years including some garbage on the football and bball court\n\n[source](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)  I didn't mean to imply that Illinois particularly is in bad shape, but just wanted to illustrate that a general trend in college athletics is very thin margins that disappear very fast for a lot of places. As for your link, it says Illinois was in the black for the 17th straight year at the end of 08-09, but that doesn't mesh with the N-G article I linked to which said that in 1997, the DIA was $1.3 million dollars in the red. One possibility is that under normal operations the DIA was scheduled or budgeted to run $1.3mln in the red in 97, but that passing the student fee then helped alleviate that.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that oftentimes non-athletes, like myself, overlook that athletes don't get to set their schedules the way a regular working student would so thanks for bringing that up. It's a lot easier to get a work/internship schedule around class and impossible to say, \"schedule this Big Ten conference matchup on another day please\" since athletes have no control over that.

I would be specific but I'm sure my old boss or coworkers are on here and I don't want to be identified.

It's not like we get to go to games for free. Assembly hall is for far more than just the athletics.  One of the proposed features is air conditioning to host summer concerts and events.  Why should DIA have to pay for that?  Pretty impressive how ignorant and self serving this article is\n\nEdit: Also impressive how out of control reaction is getting That's why I posted it... I'm friends with some people in athletics who freaked the fuck out.   Honestly, I think this all could mostly be resolved if the players were allowed to get paid like every other profession. College sports are really messed up in this way. Colleges provide special treatment to their athletes to attract and sustain good athletes because good athletes are cash cows to the universities.\n\nLet the athletes get paid, and people like this writer will see the economic worth of certain athletes. Also, then the athletes don't need to be afforded special treatment.   Is Irwin open to all students? I saw a comment on the article saying that it was....but I didn't think so. I have heard of group projects happening there and student athletes inviting everyone to work at Irwin, but that's about it. It is open to all RSOs you must reserve a time spot which is pretty competitive but still open to people who are not NCAA athletes     Another gem from the DI....   The author doesn't seem to realize that the school needs these incentives to attract good athletes to the school, so the sports programs can continue to generate revenue for the school. You've been lied to my friend. You've bought into the mythos that College Athletics (a) make a profit, and (b) that profit (if it exists) is returned to the academic portion of the university. There are relatively few (think 4 or 5) universities in the nation where both (a) &amp; (b) occur. U of I is not one of those schools. \n\nWe, students/taxpayers/property owners, subsidize the costs of student athletes and collegiate athletics. It comes out of our tuition and taxes (sales/income/property). Any source for these claims?  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/story/2012-05-14/ncaa-college-athletics-finances-database/54955804/1\n\nIf you consider the subsidy, it's pretty much even. Thanks for the source, but those number still show that the athletic department made a profit. \n\n[This one states that as of '09:](http://www.fightingillini.com/genrel/AnnualReport.html)\n\n&gt; Financially, Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget.  Not sure what your point is.. Not yourself, but ewat85 claimed that the athletic department operates at a deficit, which is the reason I requested a source.  Your source says ewat85 is wrong.  I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem. The fact that I cannot show you a source has been the product of law review articles for decades. Because college Athletic Departments, and college athletics themselves, fall under the exempt function of each university there are very few requirements placed upon their financial accounting and reporting practices. As such, there is relatively little oversight into the expenses and revenue that the universities claim to be making and spending. The line between athletic and academic expenses is a blurry one and is being abused by most, if not all, universities in this country.\n\n\nFirst let me address your statement and your source. What does the statement \"Illinois operated in the black for the 17th straight year with a $70 million budget\" lead you to believe? It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. It is written to give you the impression that they made a ton of money. Now, look through the PDF provided with that statement. Where, under the finances section, does it say that U of I took in more revenue then it spent? Nowhere. Why is that? Because it's a BS statement. \n\nHow can we be sure that it is bullshit? Because under the finance section the total revenue and total expenses are exactly equal, down to the dollar. Go talk to a CPA, a business owner, an auditor, a tax attorney, anyone with oversight over a budget. Ask them how often total expenditures match total expenses. Now ask them how often it happens two years in a row. The answer will be NEVER. It never happens, and it ABSOLUTELY NEVER happens when your budget is $70+ million. So how is it possible for it to happen here? I mean surely U of I can't just lie about these numbers.\n\nIn fact, they can. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a 501(c)(3) organization. It is tax exempt as both a government entity and as an education institution. The university files a form 990 every year in which they tell the IRS how much they make, how much their assets are worth, etc. etc. etc., what they don't tell them, and what they need not tell them, is how much money comes from each of their activities. It isn't required. Athletics is considered a tax exempt function and therefore is not broken down on the Form 990. The only information one receives is a single line under \"Miscellaneous Income\" that says \"Athletics Receipts.\" What does that mean? What is and is not included in \"Athletics Receipts.\" I can't find U of I's 2008 or 2009 return but in 2011-2012 U of I claimed ~ $3.5 million in athletics receipts. Lets just assume that U of I retained its perfect harmony on revenue and expenses for last year (which it will). What then is this $3.5 million in receipts? If expenses = revenue, what makes up this 3.5 million dollars? Why will this amount likely not be its own line on the DIA annual report? \n\nYour looking at this and saying \"So, what does any of this prove?\" \n\nSo... this shows you how little oversight there is. Athletics Receipts means something to the IRS but isn't a notation on the DIA expenses form. Expenses reported to the NCAA are different from expenses reported to the Department of Education, and different from expenses reported through the DIA. \n\nThere is no standardized accounting principle being employed by all the universities in the nation right now. There is no harmony between the numbers reported by the same institution to various organizations collecting data. What does this show? It shows that we have no idea what is being spent and where that money is coming from. Furthermore, there is little to no transparency within the Athletic Directors office. If U of I was doing such a great job of \"breaking even\" or \"turning a profit\" every year, one would think that they would be more than happy to release their books to the public. They don't and they won't. AD's are playing a shell game and they'll continue to do so until there is standardization, OR, until we once and for all treat college athletics like the money making enterprise it is and tax it. Until that time creative accounting will be used to hide the true costs of athletics from the people who are paying the price.\n\n\nSo, that wasn't very substantive, I know. However we can move on to a more concrete portion of my claim. If we take the USA Today table as true (which I would dispute) then you see that U of I averages ~$4 million in subsidies every year, or, $20 million from 2006 to 2011. That is money that comes from students and taxpayers. So ... that proves I'm correct at least to the extent that I claim that we, collectively, are subsidizing the Athletic Department. \n\n\nNow, I have a question for you. If U of I's athletic program gives back so much to the university, then, there should be some record of it somewhere. Why is it so hard to find that record?   I dont know, but you have my upvote - this was an incredibly well written explanation that deserves more upvotes than the athletics apologists in this thread. I cannot show you a source because that is the problem with College Athletics; there is a MASSIVE reporting problem.

It leads you to believe that U of I athletics netted a 70 million dollar profit. \n\nThat's not at all what that statement claims.  That's not what 'budget' means.  Even still, you've already lost all credibility by saying the athletic department operates at a deficit when sources prove otherwise. \n\nThe DIA pays for nearly everything with it's own revenue and donations from former athletes, such as myself, and not from your tax dollars or tuition costs.  Even without the subsidy, the athletic department made a profit. \n\nWith that said, these claims are far from the arguments brought up in the initial article.  You've been lied to my friend.

For instance, it gives the school national attention, and sells lisenced merhandise.  Both of these things attract students who in turn pay those fees and taxes.  Just having your schools name out there increases applications. Out of state students also pay way higher tuition.  I do agree with your main point that the benefit of sports programs is overhyped.\n\nTyped on my phone in case there's grammar nazis.

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you could have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You\u2019re fucking uneducated, kiddo.

I'm not saying don't criticize the university (after all, I am criticizing all of you) but at least don't turn every thread into a circlejerk about how tuition or admin pay is too high. \n\nAnd about tuition - for fucks sake - this is one of the top universities in the world (especially so if you are engineering), its a god damn good deal for the kind of education we are getting and the opportunities it will afford us in the future.

Isnt it snobberish to tell people how to behave on a college subreddit?   My brain suffering from chronic lack of caffeine told me the title read \"snot in the sub\" and I came in looking to find out whether it was Jimmy Johns, Silver mine, subway, or the penn station. I'm relieved to learn that it was just me being stupid.   It's hardly a circlejerk here. I say this as someone who is far from the core demographic: female and a Social Work major. I have never felt unwelcome in this subreddit due to snobbery or other reasons. Most of the snobbery you perceive is probably intended as humor. The only troublesome aspect of this subreddit is occasional racism, since even if something is meant as a joke, it can still be hurtful and unwelcoming.

Engineering is slightly harder than bashing a rival bus company and being nasty to passengers, so you might want to back off.  Apparently everyone is disagreeing with you, but I think you're right.  Examples plox? Calling the subreddit \"circlejerk central or dogs devouring dissenters left and right\" is a pretty hefty claim. Sorry, that's just me novelizing what I see, not nearly as bad as that phrase makes it. But I'm not going to single out a poster and put the blame on them. Again, it's more just mentality that slightly leaks through tone than blatant posts.  Give us examples you passive aggressive LAS pussy. /s\n\nedit: but seriously. give us some examples. wtf is LAS.   The core concept of a circlejerk and dogs devouring each other are two entirely different things...do you even know what a circlejerk is?  http://www.reddit.com/r/uiuccirclejerk/ ohohoh The core concept of a circlejerk and dogs devouring each other are two entirely different things...do you even know what a circlejerk is?  That's why I listed both of them. If they were the same I would just type one or the other. Fine, so I interpreted your use of \"or\"  in a way you didn't use it. Would you care to link us all to specific examples so we actually know what you are talking about?   I have no clue what you're talking about.  Pretty much everyone in this sub is courteous.  Post some specific examples, or else I'll just assume you just posted this for attention. Actually, I guess the fact that I'm being accused of posting for attention immediately is proof in itself... Well when you make accusations you should have evidence.  I have no clue what you're talking about.  Pretty much everyone in this sub is courteous.

I saw that post as \"Most of campus is pretty safe\", \"Unlit areas scare me\", and \"don't carry around a bunch of money\".  Not sure how that's \"snobbery\".   I doubt he is talking about that thread - the posts on that thread constitute the kind of stuff that would end up on subredditdrama. There have been posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18rkpz/why_does_it_smell_like_manure_near_isr/c8hj8pr?context=3) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18h3kg/uiuc_sees_decline_in_asian_applicants_primarily/c8gr8rx?context=3), on the other hand, that are rather malicious. This is reddit.  Though those examples are bad, they are still not nearly as bad as reddit overall.  I'd say as far as reddit goes, this sub is pretty congenial.  The op didn't mention racism, or bigotry either.  For op's first post to be insulting the general user base is pretty offensive.

I wanna ask all the physics undergrads and grads here: what's it like being a major in physics? and: What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? Do u feel worried that you won't find a job? Do you question your decision at times? What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?   I wasn't a student here, but I can answer some of your more general questions.\n\n&gt;What do graduate school look at when they evaluate your application? \n\nGrades, research experience, recommendation letters, subject GRE scores. An admissions person (at a *very* highly ranked school) told me once that they're looking for people who have at least three of those rated excellent or two outstanding.\n\n&gt;Do u feel worried that you won't find a job?\n\nNot really, but I'm not interested in a faculty position. The unemployment rate for physics PhDs is around 1%. If you're willing to sell your soul to the semiconductor or defense industries or go to the financial sector, you won't have any trouble. One of my friends who washed out of grad school (aka left with a masters) went and got a medical physics degree and is now quite happy doing medical imaging.\n\n&gt;Do you question your decision at times?\n\nI probably should have been an engineer or a chemist, but that's just me. I haven't closed any doors, but I certainly haven't been on the fastest path to get where I think I'm heading.\n\n&gt;What advice would you give to someone looking at a physics major and graduate school in physics in terms of research, specialization etc.?\n\nGet exposure to as many fields as you can. You never know what's going to actually strike a chord with you.  \n\nGet involved in research as soon as you can, but don't be afraid to change labs if it's a bad fit. That goes for grad school as well.  \n\nTake courses outside what's required. You never know when knowing how to write an efficient algorithm, speak a foreign language or quote classic literature is going to help you -- those are all real examples from my career so far!\n\nRelated to that: cross disciplinary work is the future for the sciences. Learn how to talk to chemists, biologists, etc. They're going to speak a very different language from you, especially in terms of mathematics. Who would you recommend a physics major too? As in, I am passionate about physics but am not sure if I have a very romanticized view of physics. What are some misconceptions that you might have had about a physics major that came up by surprise?     Senior in majoring in Engineering Physics atm. \n\nI came in with ap credit for Calc I and phys 211. I chose to take phys 211 to start where most other people did. The phys 211-214 courses weren't tough to me. I was in the first phys 225 course and enjoyed it because of the instructors that taught it at that time. I then took phys 325, and while it was tough, thoroughly enjoyed it because it was my first real physics course. Beyond this I have taken all of the regular physics curriculum (E&amp;M: 435/436, Quantum: 486/487, Stat Mech: 427, Labs: 401/403) and then some others (Thesis track: 496/499, Subatomic: 470), plus some upper astronomy courses. If you have questions on those feel free to ask. A lot of my time was working homework sets that could take anywhere from 1 to 10 hours depending on the course/professor. \n\nGraduate schools look at your GPA, GRE, PGRE (GRE physics subject test), research conducted, letters of recommendation, and personal statement. If you want to attend graduate school you should have some research done as an undergrad. This is not hard to obtain though. You can either go knocking on professors' doors or apply to external research programs such as REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates). I did both, first by asking around the department when I was a sophomore to do research over that summer. Then by applying to REUs and getting to accepted to one at the Uni of Neb-Lincoln. I did physics and astronomy education research during these projects. Besides research you'll want some strong letters of recommendation which you can obtain from professor by doing research or being a really good student in their course (going to office hours, answering questions, etc.). Basically getting them to know your name and yourself. The other credentials come down to you studying and working hard in your courses and preparing for the standardized tests if you need too. \n\nI do not feel worried that I won't find a job because I'm choosing to stay in academia, a.k.a. going to graduate school. I was worried at first that I wouldn't get into a graduate school, so I applied to 11 schools. Some were \"safety\" schools, while others were hard to reach programs. I have gotten into several schools and will make my decision later this semester. I do not regret my decision to pursue graduate school because I am passionate about research and know this is what I want to do after talking to multiple professors about staying in academia. If you're interested in doing graduate school for physics keep this in mind, most programs will fund you if you are choosing to pursue a doctorate degree (which takes about 5-7 years). They will fund you through either a teaching assistant-ship, research assistant-ship, fellowship, or scholarship. For example, for the several places I've been accepted they are offering me a full tuition wavier and a stipend for being a teaching assistant during the school year. \n\nFor advice, I would say make sure physics is something you are passionate about. If you do not know what field you are interested in, start going to colloquiums here to get an idea of what each subfield is like. Also, you can get an idea about which field you like when you take the respective courses. For advice on finding research, just start asking professors through email, or knock on their door and ask them in person.  Don't give up and keep trying. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot give advice on being in graduate school, but I'm sure others can help with that. \n\nIf you have any specific questions about the undergraduate program here, feel free to ask.  Can you tell us what schools you applied to and where you got in. Really want to gauge myself to see where im headed for grad school. If you could give us info about the critical stuff (GPA, GRE, PGRE, LoRs, Research Experience) will be super helpful.

Agreed, I used to go on long walks late at night on the Urbana side of campus and never once felt remotely threatened.  I don't know, maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to do, but some people act like if you step foot outside after dark you are _definitely_ going to get mugged/murdered/raped.  Okay, first strike, don't carry large amounts of cash. In addition to possibly being robbed, you can also lose it. TCF and the UIUC Credit Union have free checking accounts for students and they give you a debit card. Use them. You can cancel a lost/stolen debit card. You can't get cash back if you lose it or it is stolen. \n\nSecondly, the only place I'd feel unsafe at night is north of University or on Green St at like 4am. But don't be an idiot. Be aware of your surroundings.  Don't use a checking account to store money in a bank if safety concerns you. It's not hard for someone to mug you at an ATM and force you to withdraw $1000 in less than a minute. Instead, you want to get a savings account attached to your bank account and only store a necessary amount in the checkings account. There's no way to access the savings account at an ATM. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I think they used to be much more separate than they are now. In all seriousness is that really a thing?  My credit union allows me to withdrawal from checking or savings from any ATM.  I thought this was universal. I used to deposit my pay checks directly to my checkings account at the local bank and a bank teller once told me that it was \"not safe\" for me to have all my money in a checkings account for this reason. Perhaps she was just trying to get me to start a savings account? I'm assuming you're right.  I don't know much about banking, but if I had to guess I'd say banks can't invest with your checking but can with savings.  That's probably why savings generate interest and most checking accounts don't. Banks can't legally invest in regular savings accounts, that's why the return on them is shit.

You are right, carry on.  I merely refuted his statement about checking accounts and a thousand bucks. Chill out. What part of that comment made you think I'm not chill?

Jesus, dude, I thought I was over-cautious. \n\nI'd call anything south of Columbia or Vine in Champaign about as safe as you can get (there are like $500,000 homes on Park, Church, and Hill). The only real problem is when you start getting up toward Bradley. Bradley and McKinley is no fun, but the most dangerous parts of the entire area are downtown Champaign and Green Street, frankly. (E: I'm thinking of Champaign west of the tracks, not east. Yeah, you don't want to be north of University in Champaign east of the tracks.)\n\nAnd the six pack? I never lived on campus, but isn't that the group of residences north of the ARC? I've never felt even slightly uncomfortable there except when I first visited Champaign (on Unofficial) and there were some loudmouth assholes there. But that's Unofficial, not a problem with the Six Pack. Springfield/Gregory in Urbana is actually pretty safe IMO. I walk past there regularly (live on Springfield/Busey) and I think that the Urbana area east of north quad is actually safer than a lot of areas in Champaign. \n\nPlaces where I don't feel safe: Anywhere north of White on the Champaign side between 1st and Wright, and the area around the six pack.\n\n\"Where should the average person avoid at night while carrying lots of cash?\"\n\nEverywhere?

I would say that University is the absolute cutoff, and White is actually a little better because of the constant stream of buses (Yellow, Brown, Teal, Red) that traverse it. &gt;Anywhere north of White on the Champaign side between 1st and Wright\n\nWell, shit.

I'd avoid carrying lots of cash if at all possible...    I lived near Elm/Busey last year, and I had to walk down Western Ave (it's more an alley to be honest) at all hours of the day and night to get to lab. It's a bit sketchy I'll admit, but no one ever bothered me. I know someone was robbed earlier this year getting into a car in the parking lot at Springfield/Goodwin, but I don't think that was more chance than anything. In short, the neighborhood's alright.\n\n&gt; Where should the average person avoid at night while carrying lots of cash?\n\nEverywhere. Why would you carrying large amounts of cash at night?   Saferides are pretty awesome and free. Use them      Springfield and Gregory is quite safe.  I spent 2 years living on Springfield and Lincoln (and two years before that right over on Springfield and Green, and then one year after that just a block over on Springfield and Coler), never any issues in the area.  I'd say don't go North of University in the middle of the night and you're fine.  I feel much less safe south of Green st and West of 6th to be honest.\n\nIn general though, if you can avoid walking around alone in the middle of the night, do so.   I lived at stoughton and harvey, a block north from what you say... i never really had any problems... public safety building right there. but... keep south of university. also, who carries cash these days? There are very few crimes north of University unless you're near the student housing on Lincoln. No one's around looking for trouble since it's just a neighborhood. I walk back from downtown Champaign down Washington/Beslin/Fairview a couple times a year, and mostly it's nice old ladies out watering their flowers and some kids on bikes... It just looks super shady. Walk through the neighborhood at night alone when it gets warmer out. You won't feel safe. \n\nAnd technically you can classify every group of residences as \"just a neighborhood.\" Some neighborhoods are way worse than others. And some of these neighborhoods are right next to each other. \n\nExample: My parents live in an area where the average home is $500,000+ and there is little crime. I work 10 miles away in an area with stabbings, robberies, shootings, etc.     ", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/18sncm/ruiuc_where_do_you_feel_unsafe_around_campus/", "id": 76, "title": "/r/UIUC, where do you feel unsafe around campus?"}, {"snippet": "My buddy and I are looking for a ride back to Chicago on friday/friday night-ish.

Finishes with a touch of smoke.\n\n* Spring in Amarillo - A red ale dominated by a fruity maltiness and finishing with a touch of citrus from the exclusive use of Amarillo hops.\n\n* Blueberry Blonde - Our Light blonde with a twist: lots of blueberry. This pink/purple ale features a sweet, blueberry aroma. Flavored with blueberry juice and a touch of blueberry concentrate for aroma.\n\n* Pale Ale - One of our many pale ale recipes, this iteration contains a mix of piney and spicy hops. While it finishes decidedly crisp and bitter, there is also a persistent maltiness for balance.\n\n* Skajaquada - \"Ska-jack-wa-dah\" is our take on a Cascadian Dark Ale. While dark, almost black in color, it lacks the roasty, acrid character usually associated with black beers and instead features copious amounts of hops giving it a firmly bitter finish.\n\n* Valentine - Demonstrating our seasonal whimsy, this chocolate cherry stout was brewed especially for our February opening. Aged on a combination of all-natural Montmorency cherry puree and cocoa nibs, this is truly a dessert beer. Served on nitrogen for a creamy, luscious finish.  I don't hit reddit often but when someone mentioned this thread in the tasting room last night, I thought I would bite.\n\nI am the head brewer at Triptych, one of the three owners, and I suppose you can ask me anything. Here are some answers to the other questions:\n\n* What is the deal with the low ABV beers?\n\nAs someone else already mentioned, ABV doesn't really correspond to flavor. Our tasting room is meant to be a place you can hang out for a while, play a game of chess/cribbage/cards/whatever, and since it is the middle of winter and a little bit off the beaten path, I thought it might be nice to have some beers that you can enjoy quite a lot of without getting hammered. I did this with mostly British styles, following the tradition of a British \"session\", see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_culture#Session_drinking Also, I knew a lot of our initial visitors would be our Kickstarter supporters, many of whom were friends and family that while they appreciate our dream, they aren't quite craft beer enthusiasts yet, and so I wanted to have a range that they could enjoy as well.\n\n* Perhaps super high alcohol beers take longer to brew?\n\nThe time difference is pretty negligible, the answer is pretty much the same. I wanted to encourage some social session engagement without making it impossible for people to get back home after an evening at the tasting room. When spring and summer start rolling around and it becomes biking weather, I'll put some more higher abv beers on.\n\n* Growlers\n\nFills are currently between $14-16. And until March 2nd, we're participating in a food drive so if you bring in a non-perishable canned good, we're taking a buck off a growler fill. We sell growlers but we are also happy to fill ANYONE ELSE's 64oz growler too.\n\n* Future beers\n\nI have a significant stable of beer recipes; the idea is that every couple of weeks there is something new on tap at the tasting room. Immediately coming up we have an Imperial IPA and an English Pale ale. Following that will be a number of German lagers. We also have a couple of beers aging in Buffalo Trace Bourbon barrels.\n\nI hope folks will give us a chance. I think our prices are competitive with craft offerings you find elsewhere and as someone else mentioned, we've tried to set up a space/place/brewery that is pretty much all about beer.  Why are all these beers such low ABV? 3%? That's less than bud light. Not too appealing to me.  &gt; - 3. Spring in Amarillo\n&gt; \n&gt; Red Ale, 30 IBU, 5.9% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 6. Pale Ale\n&gt;\n&gt; American Pale Ale, 47 IBU, 4.6% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 7. Skajaquada\n&gt;\n&gt; Cascadian Dark Ale, 90 IBU, 6.8% ABV\n&gt;\n&gt; - 8. Valentine\n&gt; Cherry Chocolate Stout, 23 IBU, 6% ABV\n\nThere might be some correlation with just opening and not having super high alcohol beers. Perhaps they take longer to brew? I saw that. Still somewhat low for what they are in my opinion. Your point is definitely valid. For me, drinking a 3% ABV sounds like drinking water, especially at the cost I imagine they are charging for them.

The May application period is still active until January 2014 I was in TSM for a semester. I got rejected while I was in it. I switched back to stats/cs and was accepted. My gpa did go up but not by too much. As for the TSM major, it wasn't what I thought it'd be and it sure as hell wasn't for me.   I am good friends with 2 people who are graduating from the program this May, both of which already have solid jobs lined up with energy/ag companies. What companies, and what positions?

I'm currently in TSM with 2 semesters left after transferring from Ag &amp; Bio Engineering, but am not really familiar with the business minor.\n\nAs far as the major itself I am really enjoying it.

The name \"Fighting Illini\" pre-dates the Chief Illiniwek symbol and was bestowed upon the team in honor of Illinoisans who fought in World War I; the use of the name \"Illini\" dates to the 19th century.\n\nNice!  The senate didn't save a damn thing; people are just misinformed about where \"Fighting Illini\" actually came from.\n\n&gt;co-sponsored a well-attended debate between the College Democrats and Republicans. \n\nGood, just what everyone needs.  College aged kids arguing about politics.  So useful, and no one ever hears it enough.\n\n&gt;In November, ISS passed a resolution urging the University to divest from coal, an issue at the University for quite some time\n\nIn November, good job!  From:\n\nhttp://www.dailyillini.com/features/article_dd73d7f5-602f-5ef7-a88a-57f72fc8a8ad.html\n\n\"[Abbot is] currently in the middle of a transition away from coal, as called for by the University\u2019s 2010 Illinois Climate Action Plan, or iCAP. The iCAP aims to eliminate all coal use at Abbott by 2017.\"\n\nWay to be on time and relevant, ISS.  Please don't change.\n\n&gt;Just last month, we established the iRent Program and rented out free iClickers to students, saving them about $8,000.\n\nFuck you.  Get more professors to start putting the homework questions online or handed out in class, so students can buy old versions of textbooks for $20, not $200.  You know, something useful, instead of a $20 bauble that we'll use several times throughout our education.  The iclicker is probably the best thing we buy, in a uses:cost ratio.\n\n&gt;We passed a resolution urging the University to remain \u201ccarry-free\u201d due to the proposed firearm changes in Illinois\n\nSo, earlier, he was talking about good debates and political views.  Shouldn't this have been decided there, instead of by the ISS?  Not that their resolution would do anything.   WE'RE IN ILLINOIS.  You're about as likely to get the government in Georgia to start handing out posters promoting abortion clinics as concealed carry on this campus.  [Oh yeah, I have a source for this:](http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx)\n\n&gt;there are 21 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus: Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming.\nIn 23 states the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nIt sure is likely that Illinois, which *still* doesn't have concealed carry (yet), is going to force the campus to have concealed carry.  Good job.  The ISS, again, passes a resolution akin to \"The sun should rise tomorrow\".\n\n&gt;Many students, despite our efforts, still don\u2019t know who we are or how we can help them. Promotion is an important part to any organization\u2019s success.\n\nNo, it's just like regular politics, but to an even lesser degree (at least they can pass binding resolutions).  We've heard of the ISS (lord knows we see enough sidewalk chalk), but as long as it keeps its hands out of our pockets to do nothing and play the silly resume fluff game, we don't care.\n\n\n&gt;we avoided a possible split from the graduate delegation through committee reconstruction.\n\nDon't care.  again, stupid internal games.\n\n&gt;Although some senators may disagree with our spending, they are hypocritical in doing so. The same senators mocking our efforts actively participate in the Senate\u2019s work. \n\nI'm not even sure how to begin addressing this bullshit point.\n\n&gt;The events that we host and co-sponsor are beneficial, such as the College Democrats and Republicans debate. \n\nI see why this is the point that she chose to raise again.  It's the *least* asinine \"accomplishment\".\n\n&gt;To argue that the Illinois Student Senate has done nothing this year but promote itself is incorrect. \n\nGood point!  Time and money wasted, with no real accomplisments.\n\n&gt;Rest assured, we will continue to be the voice of our constituents and welcome anyone to attend our Wednesday meetings to voice their concerns. Remember, elections are coming up, so if you want to directly change this organization, the power is in your hands.\n\n\nThe only useful part of the whole thing. Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume? Is anyone on the student senate not on it just so they have another bullet point on their resume?  Does the ISS have any *real* power?  Are any of their decisions binding upon the Board of Trustees, or do they just pass non-binding resolutions expressing the \"sense of the student senate,\" similarly to how Congress declares \"Turnip appreciation day\" or \"National gravity awareness week\"?  I have twice said (on Reddit) the ISS does nothing to improve my education. This article hasn't done anything to change the factual accuracy of that statement. \n\nFacilitating a debate between students arguing within a false dichotomy? Passing resolutions that amount to nothing more than recommendations (and pointless ones at that, grade replacement for transfer credits, lol-worthy)? What the hell is the female leadership program supposed to do, and why should any of us believe the ISS knows anything about leadership? What else? Coal? Like the university administration isn't already aware of the issue. No-carry? Thanks for letting the next armed nutcase walk on to campus knowing none of us can fire back. \n\nAsking a private company to divulge their budgetary information? Here's an idea, instead of laying on some private company why don't you apply pressure to the UIUC administration to lower tuition and fees? Oh, that's right, it's an important issue directly affecting students, so obviously it isn't an issue the ISS cares about.\n\nThe article is a typical non-answer.

I will be graduating in May 2014, and therefore do not have to worry about re-election.

I understand that this may seem like typical campaign jargon, but I promise you will be satisfied.\n\nAs an out-of-state student, I know the financial pressures and concerns of those of you who pay the increased tuition and international fees.

ME TOO!\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Inspector General: This position would be created to audit the decisions of the Illinois Student Senate, and to give political transparency for all Illini. This is specifically in response to the fiasco over Campus Spirit Revival and their backdoor approach to legislation.\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Stenotype Operator: This position would entail recording all senate proceedings via written and/or oral transcripts. These records would then be available to all.\n\n\u2022 Weekly Massmail to all students: This would explain the highlights of the weekly session, as well as provide links to the transcripts of all proceedings for public benefit.\n\n\u2022 Creation of ISS Webmaster (Already exists. See update above): This position would entail keeping the ISS web portal up-to-date with all spending procedures and referendum announcements, as well as working with the ISS Stenotype Operator to make all sure all weekly proceedings are easily available to the student body.\n\nThere are an infinite number of questions and concerns the students of LAS have, and I assure you I will dedicate my time and energy to make sure your experience at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is as stress free as possible. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, concerns, or proposals please post here; you may also send me an email, text, or tweet. I promise to reply back within 24 hours.\n\nEmail: deese2@illinois.edu\nTwitter: @bendeese\n\nWith that being said, I thank you for your interest!\n\nHere is a link to my Facebook page if you are interested or have friends that might be. If you like what you see, a share of my page can do wonders to reach the students of this fine school:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ben.deese.senate  A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  This was the letter I received from Robert Palinkas, Director of McKinley Health Center, regarding your question about condoms. I hope this helps:\n\n\"Ben Deese\n\nI write to you today as a response to an inquiry you submitted through McKinley\u2019s website.\nMcKinley has a long history of supporting access to birth control, reaching back several decades. Certainly McKinley\u2019s commitment to supporting birth control issues predates the recent Affordable Care Act, which has considerably opened up access to contraception for the American public in general.\nOver the years, McKinley Health Center has provided six to ten different versions of oral contraceptive for a small fee of just $5/month. This is in spite of the fact that McKinley purchases those medications for $15 to $20 per month supply through our wholesale provider.\nThe recent provisions of the Affordable Care Act now have moved University of Illinois students and virtually the entire American health insured public to completely free access to contraception. This is because insurance plans are now required to identify a list of no charge medications which must be supported by the licensed insurance underwriter.\nAs a result of those provisions, students at the University of Illinois can take their receipts for most of their contraceptive purchases to their insurance carrier and submit a claim for reimbursement. Assuming that the products are among those listed on the insurance carrier\u2019s free formulary, students could expect to be reimbursed for their acquisition, subject to the provisions of their individual insurance plan. One should remember that students have health insurance from many different sources, and the provisions of their plan will vary in accordance to regional laws governing insurance underwriting.\nMcKinley also offers a number of related no charge services to students at the University of Illinois in related areas. For example, individual sessions with our sexuality health educator are no charge, and McKinley provides regular limited access to no charge condoms to all students at the Health Resource Center at the Illini Union, McKinley Health Center, and at several of the cultural houses.\nFinally, McKinley Health Center has peer educators that are certified for the purpose of presenting sexual health related programs elsewhere on campus. Perhaps you might be interested in becoming involved in this project?\" I did read that whole answer, and honestly it seems like a lot of bs. My main problem is as follows: talking to friends at other big 10 schools and ISU and a few other universities I have come to the conclusion that EVERY university besides ours has no limit on condoms or else the limit is much higher than 12 per 2 weeks. Most universities also had clubs handing them out on their respective quad or else just had bowls full of them in the dorms. It just seems like mckinley is cheaping out is all. It's still better than no free ones at all, but thank you for doing the research and getting an answer for me! I can see you do care about this and care about the students and that is important. A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  A+ should be a 4.33 and more free condoms.  I will write an email to McKinley today and ask what would be required to increase the distribution of free birth control to students. I will request permission to post the response to this thread. \n\nOn the point of GPA, I agree fully with that suggestion. In terms of pure math that would make sense, but the problem is that would allow above a 4.0 on the scale. Instead, removing an A- grade would make much more sense. If one can get above a 90% in a course, one deserves a 4.0. My mathematics professor, Aldo Manfroi, does this. It seems to work well.\n\nThing to note: This change would undoubtedly require sweeping change to the educational policy, something that requires Board of Trustees approval.  In past semesters when people in a similar situation as yours posted on reddit these are the 2 biggest things, and yet nothing seems to change. What can you do personally to follow through on these things? Also, A- being a 4.0 would also be acceptable, seems like a good compromise. I will bring it up at the ISS meetings, and if that doesn't work I will contact the university directly. Also, I have friends in Illini Media who could run stories to get the public involved. If thousands of students started mailing the chancellor and other board members, extreme pressure to act would be put on them. If a state or national news source found out, thousands of more voices could be added to the cause. The power if social media to make democratic participation easy will act as the key to change. \n\nI will also have a relatively light course load next year, so if elected, this position would be my primary focus.\n\nBasically, a \"No\" will not dissuade me from my goal, which is to make sure the opinions of the student body are brought to the table and then given an examination.  If this is a sincere answer then I truly respect that and hope for the best. As a senior graduating in May I would not personally benefit from this, but I hope future generations of students will. In past semesters when people in a similar situation as yours posted on reddit these are the 2 biggest things, and yet nothing seems to change. What can you do personally to follow through on these things? Also, A- being a 4.0 would also be acceptable, seems like a good compromise. I will write an email to McKinley today and ask what would be required to increase the distribution of free birth control to students. I will request permission to post the response to this thread. \n\nOn the point of GPA, I agree fully with that suggestion. In terms of pure math that would make sense, but the problem is that would allow above a 4.0 on the scale. Instead, removing an A- grade would make much more sense. If one can get above a 90% in a course, one deserves a 4.0. My mathematics professor, Aldo Manfroi, does this. It seems to work well.\n\nThing to note: This change would undoubtedly require sweeping change to the educational policy, something that requires Board of Trustees approval.  If you like wonky details of GPA, here is one even within the same university:\n\n* At UIUC, an A- scores 3.67 in your GPA.\n* At UIS, an A- scores 3.70 in your GPA.\n\nAs someone who delves into student data sometimes, GPA is horrifying. :D This is atrocious. If you can provide me a link to the source \u2014 for verification \u2014 I will add it to the original post, as well as my Facebook page.  Please don't try to change it. It's really not worth trying to change. Some of your other ideas are really good and worth spending time on.\n\nAnyway! The best verification I have for you is the top result from a google search for **site:uis.edu gpa**, but it was a word document.\n\nAgain, please just file this away under \"universities are complicated\" rather than under \"universities have fixable problems.\" :) I understand that you may feel that way, but unless the idea of change is instigated, nothing will ever progress. To change GPA at the university is a daunting task. However, if the University of Illinois decided to re-evaluate its policies it could be the tipping point to others doing the same. \n\nOnce one brick falls the rest will tumble.  Hi Ben,\n\nAs a current senator I'm excited to hear about your desire to gt involved and make positive changes. I would suggest though that you spend some time learning more about ISS before going out and campaigning. Most of the things you are campaigning for already exist or are out of the purview of the ISS. I don't want to rain on the parade, but I wouldn't want you to make any promises to your constituents that you will not be able to fulfill.\n\nI'm more than happy to chat with you about ISS. Feel free to contact me.\n\nKevin Seymour\nGraduate Senator Kevin,\n\nI understand that many of these ideas are already reality. The thing is that the senate.illinois.edu portal is very confusing. Although videos exist, they are not up-to-date with current information.\n\nI understand that some things may be out of the purview of the ISS, but that means that they can be added to the constitution. Just because something cannot work today is not an excuse to prevent change for tomorrow. Ben,\n\nI agree that the ISS' website is very confusing (iss.illinois.edu is the one I think you are referring too? -- senate.illinois.edu is the domain for the UC Senate which every student senator is also a part of but mostly contains faculty). The ISS has recently hired a webmaster who is currently working to update the info and make it more user friendly, this should be coming out in the next week or so.\n\nSimply changing our constitution will not suddenly give the ISS new oversight over anything we so choose. The shared governance process is very complex, and I wont try to go into here.\n\nAgain, I'm more than happy to help you better understand this in more detail if you want to meet up at some point. I think its important that candidates are armed with knowledge about how ISS works. The reason so many people are upset with the ISS these days is because of misinformation.\n\nKevin  These are great suggestions to change university policy and I hope they work well; I'm sure many in ISS and even students that aren't have ideas of this nature. \n\nOn this note, I'd like to ask a few questions - as a senator, what actions will you have to take in order to complete these goals? How much agency do you have as an individual senator to change policy? Lastly, how much agency does the ISS have in creating university policy and acting as a check and/or balance for the administration?  What do you think of the $2 fee that ISS is hoping to tax its students with?   What is your take on the current budget of the ISS? Spending $3,786.42 for hand outs on quad day just to promote the ISS seems like a waste of funds. The same applies to the PSA. What is your take on this spending ? \n[budget](http://ge.tt/3yOtxnW/v/0?c)    If you want people to vote for you, give them candy. A Werther's Original stapled to a flier will do you wonders.  To address your second and third points:\n\n - The ISS already has a staff of interns who keep pretty decent minutes (which would be on the website if it was working). In the past, ISS kept video recordings of all it's meetings, but this stopped for reasons I'm unsure of. (Probably because no one ever asked to watch them.) I'd advise against hiring an actual stenographer, as they tend to be expensive and you'd need someone to translate all their notes anyway. Maybe a YouTube channel?\n - The University Administration limits the ISS to 3 (iirc) Massmails per year. The \"Administrative Agreement\" can be renegotiated, but it's a package deal. Once you start bargaining, everything ISS related goes on the table. On a related note, the current Vice-President Internal and Historian of ISS has been trying to set up an at-least-monthly newsletter to summarize passed and pending legislation. Might be worth sending him an email.\n\nI'd also like to point out that ISS has nothing to do with setting tuition.  You say you want to \"fight for YOUR rights as a student\" which personally I find refreshing since it seems that most ISS members just want material to throw on their resume.  \nSo on that note I'm curious about your opinion on the upcoming smoking ban.  There's no reason to take away the right of someone to smoke when a compromise of making designated smoking areas protects both smokers right to smoke and nonsmokers right to not.  \n\nAlso, how willing are you to compromise and when it comes to policy you disagree with?  Will you stick to your guns not matter what, or try to find a middle ground? The smoking ban is a touchy subject, but as an elected official I do have to be neutral and represent the student body. As a non-smoker this issue does not personally effect me, but I do have friends who smoke, and I have heard their anger over the ban.\n\nI agree with you and would attempt to propose an amendment to allow designated smoking areas, if that is what the students want. The city of Champaign-Urbana tends to have a lot of wind, which could be a potential problem for smoking areas, causing the smoke to drift to those who do not want it. However, the wind would also blow the smoke up and away, making sure that the smoking areas are relatively clean. \n\nYou are right that smoking areas work; as a California resident, I have been to Disneyland multiple times, and to cater to all customers, there must be smoking areas in the park. The Walt Disney Company has done an excellent job in allowing their smoking customers to be as welcome as the non-smoking ones. To create smoking areas would require a monetary investment, but if it could work, the rights of all students would be honored. With that being said, the issue is that in a democracy people will still be disappointed no matter what.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/17ulkk/i_am_running_for_iss_in_the_upcoming_election_so/", "id": 222, "title": "I am running for ISS in the upcoming election, so as to make our student government more transparent."}, {"snippet": "Sign up at: http://tinyurl.com/guitarpedal\n\nIEEE will be hosting a Guitar Pedal Workshop in 241/245 Everitt Lab at 2PM on February 17th, 2013!

Business major checking in. Going to whore myself out to Corporate America while still living like a college student. You shouldn't be spending more than $20,000 a year to live comfortably. As long as you make more than that (very easy,) and don't go on any big vacations (not so easy,) you should be able to put a lot of each paycheck into your debt. \n\nIt's all about living within your means. Hope this gives you some comfort. Dolla dolla bill, yall.

No car, no health insurance, no retirement savings, going to the movies is considered a splurge. If you want to live \"comfortably\" in this town, which is significantly cheaper than a real city, you'll need more than that. I don't know about Seattle, but I can assure you that thousands of grad students live in this town on $20k or less (before taxes), while having both a car and a health insurance.  If they do not work over the summer at all, grad students average $17,183 per person. They live, but it'll assure you none of them will say it's a comfortable life.\n\nIt occurs to me that $20k is probably doable if you've got roommates. I suppose that would make a huge difference when compared to where my expenses go. I'm a grad student and I feel very comfortable on the 1.8k-ish I get per month.  Rent+utilities+food+monthly costs is maybe 800/mo tops (I have shopped around to keep this down), and this leaves me a ton for travel, climbing gear (big money sink), eating/going out, etc.  \n\nIf you aren't lazy, supporting someone, or really materialistic, I don't know how 20k isn't reasonable to live on. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low. Imagine being in Chicago or any other major city. You can't get by paying $350 rent. You are going to be paying at least $700 for rent and higher on everything else. Well most posts here are from people living in champaign where living cost is very low.

Hey, I'd be interested, but my main concern is the heavy load that I'd probably pull.  Do they have any limits on usage that they don't exactly advertise?  Or maybe not very torrent friendly?  I've uploaded over a TB to Bitcasa in the last week and it's still running.  I typically use newsgroups instead of torrents so I have no idea how they are with torrents.

I'm going to try to talk to the sales rep but it's be more convincing in saying \"I know someone who lives in this area and got this deal. Gimme!\" :)  If you search the internet a bit, you would discover that comcast loves, just loves charging random amounts of money for the same service. The trick is to find the lowest number in the below answers, then go the comcast office physicially (it is located near Urbana high school on race street). Wait in line, talk to the Comcast person [be extremely polite]: \"I am a very poor student/unemployed/etc and I really like comcast services because they wonderful, but they cost too much. It turns out I can pay only $&lt;insert amount&gt; for similar services from X. Could you please reduce my bill somehow? Otherwise, I would have to change service provider.\"\n\nAnd thats it - they would be happy to give you a better \"limited time\" deal. I know because I did it recently, and I am neither a student nor poor. You might have to repeat it after a year or so - their deals are always limited. Also, if you connected somebody else for a year, and reconnect to them, they would consider your a new customer, and give you a good deal. \n\nAlso, if you are in the right area, uc2b is probably the future. I am sure going to dance with happiness when they are able to connect to my neighberhood/home. http://uc2b.net/ Thanks, I know Comcast is super random with their pricing. I even gave them a factual example of what my friend is paying, but they were pretty firm saying that's \"as low as they can go.\" \n\nI had even less luck over the chat service, and so I had to call retentions on the phone.  $93/month for Comcast Digital Starter w/ HBO &amp; Showtime, Performance Internet, HD service fee, and modem rental Nice!

Ive got my own modem, no hd box though. \n\nI would split internet with my neighbors but I have none.... Did you go to Best Buy or something? Or just walked in to the Comcast office?

Any good places to hike/walk nearby  for those without cars?  We do live in quite the shitty area for outdoor activities, but all is not lost. Could you give a better idea of what you're looking for? Day hikes (so 3 to 10 miles) or more backpacking (multiple days with camping)? Do you have a car to travel in? How far are you willing to drive? Have a car, willing to travel up to 2 hours, looking for a day hike spot since my camping gear is nonexistent.  Let me throw out a couple locations for you to try out.\n\nThe best area close by is [Kickapoo State Park](http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R3/kickapoo.htm), [Kennekuk County Park](http://www.vccd.org/gikennekuk.html), and Middle Fork State Fish and Wildlife Area. They are all part of a river system that was bought up in the 1960s with the intention of flooding it all to turn into a lake. There was a ton of push back from environmental groups, so it just ended up getting split up into these three parks, as no one agency could afford to run the whole thing. \n\nKickapoo - This is a cool area that is a reclamed strip mining site from the early 20th century. There are tons of small lakes that you can rent canoes on and paddles through some really clear water. They also can drop you up a few miles with canoes and tubes on a river that runs the length of all the parks. It's a nice park, but the busiest of the three. There are lots of small hiking trails here and it' worth checking out. There is also a frisbee golf course here.\n\nKennekuk County Park - This one has one big lake that has about a 7 mile loop that goes around it. It's a really nice hike that goes up and down through forests and parries, and with it being that long without many entrances, it's a good opportunity to get away and not have to see many people for a couple hourse. There are a few picnic tables and benches along the way so take a lunch. There are also mile markers so you know exactly how far you have to go.\n\nMiddle Fork Fish and Wildlife Area - This place has 35 miles of hiking trails looping through forests and grassland. Tons of day hikes available here, it's the farthest from CU at about 35 minute drive. You can get to Kickapoo in 25 minutes.\n\n\nThere are other things around, Lake Shelbyville is a little over and hour south. Clinton Lake has a nuclear reactor on it, and if you're looking for something really cool to do right now, get there in the early morning when the sun is just coming up. The lake is heated by the reactor, so there are fish flying all over catching insects that can still survive through winter, they dive through the steam rising off the water, it's a beautiful sight. There's also Turkey Run State Park over in Indiana, and Shades State Park in Indiana also, those are about 1.5 hours. Homer lake is alright, and probably the closest, it's 10 miles east of town and has about 20 miles of hiking trails.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions. That kind of turned into a general natural area tour of the area. I was feeling a bit confined when I first moved here as I like being outside a lot, and while people bitch that there isn't anything to do around here, you just have to look a little harder. If you get sick of the local stuff, Shawnee National Forest and Hoosier National Forest are each 3 hour drive in different directions. Both are amazing and you should definitely see before leaving the area. Have a car, willing to travel up to 2 hours, looking for a day hike spot since my camping gear is nonexistent.   Hey man i'm really into hiking and backpacking, I just transferred here and I've been looking around for places to hike.\n\nFrom what I've read, there's not too many hilly areas to hike in - although there are nice trails, some of which are dense, and lakes/rivers that are all connected to go canoeing through.\n\ncheck out kickapoo state park\nhttp://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R3/kickapoo.htm\n\n\nI'm currently looking for a student organization that hosts events to go hiking/backpacking - but so far, no luck :\\.\n\nIf you come across one shoot me a PM.\n\n\nP.S.

My phone may still be lost, but the help is making me feel a bit more hopeful. So, it's important that you answer a couple questions. Was it powered on? Was Mobile Data turned on? Was GPS turned on?\n\nIf your phone is on, and data is on, you can *remotely* install tracker apps, such as [this one.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&amp;hl=en) Just log in to the same google account you used for the phone's setup, and click install. From there, follow the app's instructions to locate your phone.\n\nLet me know if you get stuck anywhere. It was on, and I believe it's still on because when I call it, it still rings and doesn't go straight to voicemail. I think Mobile Data was turned on... and I'm not sure about GPS.\n\nI guess I don't know how to push apps. I'm trying but it doesn't seem to be working. \n\nTbh, the main problem I'm having is remembering the google account I created for the phone setup. I can't access it because I don't remember the username or password. Which is just dumb of me, I should have written it down somewhere, but didn't :( Here's a way to jolt your memory. Whenever you added a contact, it says the google account you're logged in under at the top. Do you remember what it was?\n\nAlso, do you have a gmail? Which email account did you read on your email app?\n\nHere's how pushing works. It's really simple! So, go to this page: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd\n\nand in the upper right corner, log in to your google account (that you definitely remember :) ), then click the little \"INSTALL\" button on the left next to the little droid guy. A \"Checkout\" dialog will pop up. Select your device from the dropdown menu (it'll be selected by default, assuming you don't have more than one android phone on this google account) then click \"INSTALL\" one more time.\n\nThe phone takes care of the rest! You'll receive emails about the phone to the email that you logged in with.\n\nAlso, for that particular app, here's a great tutorial about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gcTZbreowJM#! You are very thorough and helpful, thanks so much for trying. \n\nMy parents freaked out about the phone being lost and just deactivated it.

That's a good trick to try to trigger it. \n\nThank you again for all the help. I'm so sorry! I wish I could be more help, but I can't do much about that. I'm so sorry!

[Black Dog](http://www.facebook.com/BlackDogSmokeAndAleHouse) is a BBQ restaurant in Urbana that uses a lot of locally grown and raised products and prides themselves on that. It's a BBQ place so it's definitely possible to eat really unhealthy there, but you pick your own sides and the sauce comes on the side so it's also easy to eat healthy if you want to. As a bonus their beer menu is usually pretty good. Black Dog is my favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, and is in the running for my favorite anywhere. But I don't see how you can call it healthy. I honestly can't think of one meal that you could put together on their menu that would be \"healthy.\"\n\nI'm going to go ahead and keep on eating there anyway. You can get a beef brisket or pull pork platter at black dog with a sweet potato and veggies as your side. They put the BBQ sauce on the side so you aren't forced to smother your food in sauce. There's nothing that unhealthy about it.\n\nOrdering a pulled pork sandwich smothered in sauce with fries and pit beans on the side would be a way to make it unhealthy. Smoked meat is fairly unhealthy. Beef is fairly unhealthy. Pulled pork (pork shoulder or pork butt) is quite fatty and generally unhealthy. \n\nAs far as BBQ goes, what you're describing is healthy. But BBQ is not healthy. \n\nI'm going to keep eating there, regardless. There's nothing unhealthy about beef or fatty meat, really. Saturated fat isn't bad for one's health. That's plain inaccurate. The exact nature of the link is somewhat unclear, but saturated fat is generally considered among medical authorities to be unhealthy. \n\nAnd, unlike the lack of clarity on saturated fat, there's absolutely no debate about the fact that beef is bad for you. And that smoked meats are bad for you. That's not even in debate. \n\nBut hell, an accountant asserts otherwise. Smoking meats is a great way to add flavor without calories. I'd like to see you come up with a healthier way to cook chicken/turkey.\n\nThe sauces don't have to be unhealthy either. A pulled chicken platter with Carolina Vinegar (It's exactly what it sounds like. Apple Vinegar with dried ground peppers in it) would be a great way to go at Black Dog if you're tying to keep your caloric intake down. Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket is pretty awesome if you're concerned about protein though.\n\nOn the other hand, Ribs are TERRIBLE for you. 400 calories a piece and not much else.

We went to the CPD today but they weren't very helpful as the guy in charge was out of office.  I'll be emailing him, but I was just wondering if anyone knew of any rules/laws my roommates and I should be aware of before throwing this? We've thrown huge parties for Unofficial before but they've always been indoors.  you will get boned if you have a single under 21 in there      I noticed you said kegS. Not sure how it works for a yard/outdoor party, but I know you're not allowed to have more than 1 keg at any indoor party. Last year CPD caught us getting 2 the day before, took one away, and gave us a $320 ticket. Double check to make sure how many you can have. How did that happen? Why didnt you tell them they were not going to the same location? Or if they showed up at your place, why did you answer and let them in? I guarantee they didn't have a warrant.  I put 1 keg under my name, my roommate put 1 keg under our neighbor's name (they had given us permission but were all at work for the night, and this was the Thursday before Unofficial). Cops saw us put 2 kegs in the car, followed us, then once we started bringing the second keg up they busted us, mainly because we didn't have our neighbor's keys on us so they were being put in the same apartment right away. \n\nRecommendation: take the time to go to multiple liquor stores and get 1 keg from each. Not only will you not get caught how we did, when the cops get the records of keg purchases there won't be two at the same location from each store.  Wow I can not believe that cops followed you to your house because you had kegs. That just fires me up but I know there's really nothing you could have done. It also really bothers me that cops have records to keg purchases. Is there no privacy or explicit rights on a college campus when it comes to drinking? Yeah it was pretty shitty, especially cuz at that point we knew they would have an eye on our place for any questionable activity all day. I'm not sure if there are normally privacy laws, but I know a lot of laws are 'changed' in a sense on Unofficial because of all of the injuries/alcohol poisoning/death that has happened in recent years. i.e. you can get multiple kegs legally with a permit, but said permit is not available for Unofficial. Also, supplying minors got bumped up from a standard ticket to a criminal misdemeanor last year.  You can have 2 kegs. You just need to get a permit at city hall for $25 bucks. They don't give that permit out for the day of unofficial. At least they didn't last year, because when I was getting the ticket I asked if there was anything we could have done and he told me about that permit but that they don't allow it on unofficial.   yeah id say best bet is to invite your 21 and over friends. Also try renting fences to control the inflow and outflow. Make sure you get your kegs a day or two early.  You're uninvited you are a mean person. http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/GifGuide/DealWithIt/tumblr_limthcd5BD1qfyv11o1_500.gif why does this exist    I thought unoffical was started because of all the police attention people would get on St Patricks weekend.

But the fact that they are misleading and intentionally trying to garner sympathy in places where sympathy might not be due doesn't seem right to me.\n\nMaybe this one hasn't had things cut out, but then there was another one being handed out that had more information. I know, I got it and read it. Tangent to what you're saying, but: The admins aren't nearly as overpaid as you might think. Compare [these numbers](http://data.illinimedia.com/salaries/index) to private industry numbers for people with similar degrees and experience - you'll notice that they almost always take a cut by working at the University. For good reason probably, it's probably a much better environment to work in with far more job security.

The question is, why are admin positions multiplying and tenure positions decreasing? Broadly speaking, of course, UIUC may be different in this regard, but over the entire higher education industry it is a verifiable trend.\n\nLast time I checked admins didn't teach courses. So why the fuck are there more admins and less professors, and why the fuck do we pay so much tuition just to, more or less, be taught by fucking grad students?\n\nShort answer: the administration is incompetent. That's a different discussion entirely - but I'll play along.\n\nOne: Let's assume that it's as you say - the administration is incompetent. What's your solution?\n\nIf the administration is incompetent, then we need to hire a higher caliber of employee - somebody who can competently perform their jobs. OK. To draw in higher quality administration, what do we have to do?\n\nOh, right. Pay them more.\n\n______\n\nTwo: Let's look at our current administration, and figure out what the problem is. Incompetent administrators - the problem. And, let's say that higher pay is out of the question. Where are we getting our administrators from? A few I pulled off the top of my head:\n\n[Hirschi](http://abe.illinois.edu/faculty/M_Hirschi)\n\n[Ravaioli](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile.asp?ravaioli)\n\n[Andrejasich](http://www.arch.illinois.edu/people/faculty/andrejas/)\n\n[LAS's entire leadership, basically](http://www.las.illinois.edu/about/leadership/)\n\nWhat's the common theme? I've got one - they all came from their fields. None of them have actual degrees in administration. In fact, almost every single Dean started out as a professor. The administration is not, in fact, administrative professionals. It's a bunch of old professors.\n\nYou could see how this could be a problem.\n\nNow, here's two things I want to point out. 1) You're right, we have less tenured professors- because they keep going into administration. 2) We have established a status quo of all administrators being ex-professors.\n\nThis status quo is an issue - and here's why; when an actual professional administrator comes in, the professionals can't do their jobs right. Weird, right? The faculty is used to the administrators being other ex-professors who \"worked their way up;\" lo and behold, they don't listen to the professional administrators. And just like that, your competent professional administrators are rendered useless - and not due to any incompetence or fault of their own, but in fact because of the professors - who we try so hard to hold blameless.\n\nIt's funny, things aren't nearly so simple as they seem at first.  &gt;If the administration is incompetent, then we need to hire a higher caliber of employee - somebody who can competently perform their jobs.\n\nThis is a short-sighted answer. Sometimes incompetence exists because of the individual, but most of the time it exists because of administrative structures. Put all the UIUC administrators in an institution that is designed better and you'll get better employees most of the time.\n\nOf course, this is America, and we tend to believe individual effort is everything, but at the end of the day context is usually far more important. I suppose I should have pointed this out to begin with, but it usually doesn't occur to me to include my broader philosophy in every post.\n\n&gt;1) You're right, we have less tenured professors- because they keep going into administration. 2) We have established a status quo of all administrators being ex-professors.\n\nI'm glad ex-professors take up administrative roles. It shouldn't be any other way, but it's incorrect for you to say this phenomenon is what is causing less tenured professor positions to exist. It's a budgetary reason it's happening, it isn't happening because there aren't quality professors out there looking for a job.\n\n&gt;And just like that, your competent professional administrators are rendered useless - and not due to any incompetence or fault of their own, but in fact because of the professors - who we try so hard to hold blameless.\n\nSo, everything is the professor's fault? In that case lets fire all the professors. What do these silly professors know about education compared to somebody who has never stepped foot into a classroom?\n\nI, for one, am not interested in putting our schools into the hands of corporate suits who only know how to focus on numerical metrics. Teaching to the test and multiple-choice scantron tests are already prevalent enough in our educational institutions, we don't need to put people in charge who will only increase such things. Jesus, have we learned nothing from Leave No Child Behind?\n\n&gt;It's funny, things aren't nearly so simple as they seem at first.\n\nWhat's funny is that you bought into the bullshit lie that generic MBAs can do a great job in any industry. Every industry is different, and you want people to run things who understand those differences. You don't want some suit who only knows generic business practices to come in and be in charge.\n\nPS: You get an upvote from me because fuck Redditors who can't notice a decently constructed argument. You shouldn't have been downvoted. &gt;This is a short-sighted answer. Sometimes incompetence exists because of the individual, but most of the time it exists because of administrative structures. Put all the UIUC administrators in an institution that is designed better and you'll get better employees most of the time.\n\nAgreed. I don't believe in that argument one bit - it just bothers me that people argue that the administration is incompetent and underpaid - and then offer NO solution whatsoever. I actually am not nearly as pro-administration as these arguments might make me look - but everyone loves to beat that stupid \"The administration is incompetent\" drum, and it drives me up the bloody wall.\n\n&gt;So, everything is the professor's fault? \n\nNo. There needs to be balance. A whole bunch of professors and nobody who has been trained to administer = A clusterfuck where nobody knows how to get things done. A whole bunch of administrators and nothing else = A clusterfuck where nobody knows what needs to be done. There is an absolute need for both kinds of people. Similarly, there's no reason that the professors shouldn't take courses in how to properly work in university administration - the U of I has specific courses in how to properly administer to a university; why aren't we taking advantage of them?\n\n&gt;I, for one, am not interested in putting our schools into the hands of corporate suits who only know how to focus on numerical metrics. Teaching to the test and multiple-choice scantron tests are already prevalent enough in our educational institutions, we don't need to put people in charge who will only increase such things. Jesus, have we learned nothing from Leave No Child Behind?\n\nThat's hyperbole. There are issues - for instance, a professor recently was unhappy with the way that students were performing in his studio classes. This was one of the colleges where a professor's students' performance can affect whether or not said professor gets tenure. The professor mandated 2 extra 3 hour studios per week - on a Thursday and a Sunday - and said that if the students didn't come to these studios that were not on the syllabus, they would lose one letter grade per absence.\n\nHaving a professional administrator there to tell them \"Hey, you can't fucking do that\" is really important. In a lot of departments, those extra-curricular studios are part of the culture, and it's not a big jump to go from \"strongly encouraging\" to \"requiring;\" having that professional from an outside culture there protects against that.\n\n&gt;What's funny is that you bought into the bullshit lie that generic MBAs can do a great job in any industry. Every industry is different, and you want people to run things who understand those differences. You don't want some suit who only knows generic business practices to come in and be in charge.\n\nDidn't say generic MBA, don't buy into that lie. I said a professional administrator - someone who specializes in administration in education. Do I want a businessman in there? No. I want a guy with a degree like [this](http://education.illinois.edu/epol/programs/edadmin).   I agree that the University administration is for the most part a group of selfish morons, but my experiences over 2 years with dining workers has not been good either.

They did this two years ago when I lived there. I lived on the first floor and could hear them demanding better conditions at the top of their lungs. Nothing like being woken up at 6 AM by people demanding things. If anything I just rooted against them because they disturbed my sleeping patterns. ^ Typical selfish suburban kid. Fact: College is damn expensive, even with in-state tuition.\n\nFact:  Few things restrict academic performance as severely as sleep deprivation.\n\nFact:  For various reasons, many college students work late into the night, and at 6AM, may have only recently gone to sleep.\n\nFact:  Students and their parents both have the right to demand that they get the maximum value out of their college expenditure.\n\nWhile some students might be \"selfish suburban kids,\" and are only angry at the demonstrators for aggrivating their hangovers, there are lots of students who actually might be harmed.  How would you feel if you messed up an exam because you had been kept awake by protestors?  What if that one test dropped your grade in the class, resulting in the loss of a scholarship?\n\nThey're trying to use the students as pawns in their little chess game with administration, and in so doing, they're either forgetting or ignoring the fact that without the students, they wouldn't have jobs in the first place. &gt;Fact: For various reasons, many college students work late into the night, and at 6AM, may have only recently gone to sleep.\n\nlulz-worthy\n\nGuess what, the world doesn't stop for you, me, or anybody else. 6am is daytime. At 6am, it is legitimate for loud things to be going on outside your apartment.\n\nProtip: Most of the country is *not* on a college student's schedule.\n\nNow if they were protesting at 4am, that'd be a problem. To be fair, 6am is probably the earliest something like road construction or protesting could begin. \n\nKeep in mind lots of professionals wake up *before* 6am, especially those who have a long commute. I don't know about other places, but in my hometown, the noise ordnance forbids lawn-mowing or other loud noises before 8AM on weekdays.\n\nFurther, the world doesn't run on a college student's schedule, but oh, wait....where are we?  Right...Champaign-Urbana.  A *college town.* So what, because CU is a mid-sized city with a huge university everybody else who lives here is supposed to converge on a college students schedule? Wishful thinking.\n\nMost students on the UIUC campus are transplants, mostly from Chicago it seems. It's a bit ridiculous to expect all the locals to adopt a mindset that benefits a bunch of outsiders. The world just doesn't work like that.

We\u2019re a Research I institution. Research is so highly valued here that deplorable teaching\u2014especially in the sciences\u2014is pretty much par for the course. I don\u2019t know how to fix this, but it\u2019s something that students (and prospective students) should keep in mind. Granted, I haven't hit 400 level courses yet, but I can only think of two teachers I didn't care for and I took Calc 2 -&gt; 286. Only one was particularly bad (an ECE course), and the other just wasn't a good fit with me because I was too stubborn to read the book (calc 3 prof).

I took CalcI\\II over at UIC. Was really a fan of their teaching model (or maybe i just got good professors). \n\nAnyway there would be 3 lectures and 2 optional discussions a week. Lectures would consist of professors doing some basic proofs but mostly spending time explaining really hard problems to you, then assigning tricky problems for homework.

There is always a line till the door and for that price you can have a meal at a Mexican restaurant with chips, salsa, service and a guaranteed place to sit. Ordering online is a lifesaver.

I run a bit, but I want to start putting on muscle. I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to working with weights and lifting. I'm thinking about getting a trainer at least once a week to learn how to lift/so I don't kill myself, etc. \n\nAnyway, any experiences, recommendations for trainers?  I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/ Ignoring quality issues (I can't speak as to the quality of personal trainers, so we'll ignore that), for many people spending money on something psychologically affects how they view it.  \n\nIf you have paid for an appointment, it is a lot easier to make sure you put the time/consistency in, and for many people, this can be very important to make sure they follow through.\n\nFor many people (myself in the past) consistency is more important than the quality of their workout, and I feel a small investment to ensure that isn't a bad thing.

I paid $50 for a group fitness pass one semester thinking it would motivate me to go to the gym to get my money's worth, but I went to exactly 3 classes that semester. In general I think gym memberships are often underutilized, people buy a membership as a New Year's resolution and then give up on it after the first few weeks. I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/ Why is that? My roommate is a NASM certified personal trainer, and he has been for 4 years now. I'm fairly certain he knows what he is doing. Plus 1-on-1 personal training is only 25$ per session or 20$ per session if you buy 10 sessions, which is fairly cheap. Why spend money on something you can get for free? My roommate is also a trainer, and he's legit, but OP would likely reach his goals just as fast with an experienced workout partner. Oh I completely agree, but if OP had an experienced workout partner to learn from, they probably wouldn't be posting this.  I humbly recommend you stay away from trainers and instead suggest you hit up /r/fitness and 4chan's /fit/  I'm going with what logged_in_for_this said: stay away from the personal trainers. If you want to learn how to lift, I can guarantee someone from Illini Bodybuilding Club or Illini Powerlifting would be happy to teach you. I'd personally be happy to teach you if you are free to hit the ARC in the evenings. Any of these options would allow you to build muscle a lot more efficiently than what most PTs can offer you.\n\nWith that said, if you're bent on going with a personal trainer, I would highly recommend going with Matt Clark or Sergio Luna. I know them personally, and they take training very seriously. Can vouch for Sergio, here. Workout buddy (to some degree) of mine. Dude definitely knows what he's talking about and doing and he's just an overall great guy, too. Yeah, definitely! I feel like he's one of few who are actually driven to be a PT or in the RST program. It really is his thing.\n\nBtw, do I know you? I'm James, the guy who started the Illini Bodybuilding Club. Okay, next question... I don't know if you're the right person to ask, but if I do want to work with Sergio, do I still have to fill out this [sheet](http://www.campusrec.illinois.edu/personalTraining/) online?\n\nIt seems like that would randomly assign me a trainer, and I'd rather work with one of the people you recommended.  Yeah, definitely! I feel like he's one of few who are actually driven to be a PT or in the RST program. It really is his thing.\n\nBtw, do I know you? I'm James, the guy who started the Illini Bodybuilding Club. Nah, probably not. My name's Kelton and I've worked in with him a couple times and chat with him every time we're both down there now. I generally work out alone but have considered joining one of the groups (powerlifting/bodybuilding) for the social aspect or advice/pointers. Ah, okay. Yeah, you should join the Facebook page. If you see someone in a club shirt, feel free to say hi too. I'm going with what logged_in_for_this said: stay away from the personal trainers. If you want to learn how to lift, I can guarantee someone from Illini Bodybuilding Club or Illini Powerlifting would be happy to teach you. I'd personally be happy to teach you if you are free to hit the ARC in the evenings. Any of these options would allow you to build muscle a lot more efficiently than what most PTs can offer you.\n\nWith that said, if you're bent on going with a personal trainer, I would highly recommend going with Matt Clark or Sergio Luna. I know them personally, and they take training very seriously. I'm a co-worker of Sergio's and can also vouch for him. He is amazing at what he does and has an incredible view on fitness/lifting/nutrition etc. You should definitely make an appointment to meet with him. You won't regret it.  Hey, how do I make an appointment to meet him, like I said earlier, it seems like I'm just supposed to fill out a form and they assign someone to me. \n\nIs there any way I can request him?  I've met and talked with several of them and they are nice people.\n\nThat being said, personal trainers are best for people who just can't get motivated to go to the gym for any reason. Their business model exists to get you to keep paying them, when in reality a personal trainer could teach you everything you need to stop requiring their services in four or five sessions. If you're an *absolute* newbie, my recommendation would be to buy [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360247917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=starting+strength). It's not the end-all be-all of weight training, but it's the best I know of for a beginner.\n\nAs to the ARC trainers specifically, I have seen some of them doing good work, and others doing bullshit bosu ball core crap. I have seen at least one training clients to squat with improper form. They may be correcting their form over a few sessions. After they get hurt?    I am a current client of a personal trainer at the ARC (Sergio). I have been working with him for almost a month now. As a student who started off as a complete beginner (I had a trainer for 3 months last semester) having a trainer helps immensely. I *highly* recommend a personal trainer if you can afford it. Having someone who is NASM certified to construct your fitness plan based on your own personal goals is completely worth it. \n\nAlso having a personal trainer is great for instruction. It's not always how much you train or what you do, it's *how* you do it. Technique in the beginning is essential to ensure that you don't get hurt and that your training is more fruitful. \n\nYou probably won't need a personal trainer forever. You are constantly learning while you're training. Also think of all that money you spend as an investment in your future, being a healthy, fit person. It would be a shame to spend that money on medical bills from being out of shape or overweight.

During the summer is a whole new ball game however. A pair came up to me once when I was filling up at the gas station right next to it. Chatted for a bit, not bad people but they were really weasely when asked about Joseph Smith's history of making shit up and how there is no lingusitc or genetic link between Native Americans and Semites.  I've met a few Mormons, and yeah, that sounds really accurate.  Super nice people, but when it comes to religion, it seems like they just love to argue/debate.  Honestly, I'm pretty firmly rooted in my beliefs.  They won't be able to change me one bit.  But its interesting to hear things from their perspective. They didn't really argue/debate, they just attempted to dodge the subject of Joseph Smith's reputation, the characters that Lucy Harris copied being declared nonsense, or how Joseph Smith was unable to reproduce the Book of Lehi when the original manuscript was lost.

I went there with a broken laptop screen wondering if they could replace it. The guy spent a couple of minutes trying to find the appropriate screen for the model of my laptop to no avail, telling me that Sony screens are especially hard to come by. Anyways, after failing at that finding one, he ended up suggesting that I leave the laptop with them and gave me a rough estimate for fixing the screen: $150 for a new screen and then $120-something for the labor, plus a suggested $40 \"diagnostic\".... which is honestly ridiculous. I left the store with my laptop, refusing to pay such a ludicrous price for a simple procedure and searched online for a replacement screen. Found the one I needed within a minute on amazon for 50 bucks, and a tutorial video on how to replace the screen myself. I spent a total of 60 bucks for the screen and tools and ten minutes of labor vs. their $270 quote. I'm sure my story is a rare sour note, but I honestly felt like they tried to milk me for my money.

I had the opposite experience this year -- made my landlord (Bankier) put a couple of things in the lease to improve, and they made vague noises about fixing it up a bit, but I didn't expect anything more than what I had put in the lease. Moved in to the promised improvements, plus all new carpet and new light fixtures. I'm still pleasantly shocked.  yea, I had Bankier as my landlord last year and was pretty happy with them I have them this year and am going to sign with them again next year. The people in the office are just genuine and nice people that are really helpful when you have a problem. No big complaints from me so far. Really? I always got the slimy-car-salesman feeling from them. I called them to get parking for my current apartment last year and I was assured that there were over 5 garage parking spots left, and was quoted prices for indoor and outdoor parking. I showed up the next day, and suddenly all the garage parking spots were taken and the prices for outdoor parking had gone up $10. I haven't really trusted them since then.

But fuck it because karma.    Yeah I know there isn't a legal basis to claim they were supposed to remodel. I asked them to add it to the lease but they gave me some corporate response saying there was no need to blah blah blah and it was already June and it was the last 1bdr under $600 in west campus. So it was that or I had to go live in Urbana not close to my classes. Regardless it felt good to take a stab at them for once. Its not like they ever give back deposits anyway   They promised me brand new carpet and showed me this awesome apt... it was not the apartment they gave me the keys to.\nInstead, I got an apartment infested with bedbugs and doors that weren't secure.  So I signed a lease with CPM for next year. What exactly is so terrible about them, and what alternatives are there on campus. I looked into roland and jsm, their stuff is way to expensive.  They just neglect buildings until the last possible minute. They will penny pinch and cut as many corners as possible. They talk out of their ass and make so many promises and offer you \"free parking pass\" (they do actually give you the pass). They are rude and come in whenever they please to show your apartment. They will asses as many fees as possible for any little thing. They come at your for bogus \"no rent paid\" claims and if you don't stand up they won't back down. My TV was stolen from them over the summer and they flat out denied that anyone was in there even though there was a note left by a CPM worker. They didn't even return calls from the police and its not like most care to go the extra mile. My friend had his laptop stolen another had his Xbox stolen. They are liars and thief's. One guy who's as bipolar as they come is Jerome. Hes the tall black guy. He's seems as professional and nice as anyone but once you lease he doesn't care what you have to say is extremely rude and condescending. All I'm all I have lived with Roland, University Group, and CPM. Even though they all cut corners somewhere CPM is flat out incompetent. They get tenants every year because of their low rents but they have the worst reviews. The other ones are worth the extra money. So I signed a lease with CPM for next year.

Mandarin is a very important language that doesn't get enough exposure in the US. More people speak Mandarin than English in this world, and yet American educational institutions ignore it in favor of familiar languages like German and French. These languages have merit as well, but when you consider that most Mandarin speakers also speak English at some level, it's pretty clear that Americans are behind the curve when it comes to learning other languages. Don't be so quick to assume that this is some infiltration attempt - it has been assessed as very low risk, and it is a downright useful program to have. We let the EU and the Austrian government fund educational programs on our campus, why not give the Confucius Institute a chance? I could not find the Austrian government funded educational program here, so I cannot comment on their contributions. The EU group runs it's own degree rather than offering money to another established group on campus. Additionally the EU represents a huge chunk of Europe encompassing many ideals. The Confucius Institute is offering money to a group that already studies multiple countries in east asia. I can't find out if the money is no-strings-attached money or not. Would the Chinese government be fully OK with their money being used to study issues in Japan? If that is not the case, then this is the so called \"Influencing research priorities\" that people are worried about.\n\nEDIT: Why not support the Freeman fellows? They've been on the brink of closing for years. I am a Chinese student. I got an intern in Ministry of Foreign Affairs of People's Republic of China. From my experience in MFA-PRC,here is what I can tell you:\n1) Although China is one of a super powers country in the world, it only has economic influence. According to a survey conducted by The Times, majority of western country residents think China is a autocratic country like old Russia. It is true that China is still ruled by one party but compare to Russia or India, the \"autocratic\" government is more efficient and has more probity. The stereotype of \"undemocratic\" country ignored the fact China is trying to more democrat and a complete democratic election may not be good for China. To increase the political power and change the stereotype, it is important for foreigners know that our government is more efficient than some other democratic country, for example India or Russia. We also want foreigners know more about our culture. Not just ancient culture but also popular culture like our movie, our books our TV. The academic classes normally will not discuss modern China as the way our government want. So it is necessary for us build an institution to  show American a real China.  This is not brain washing because we just present facts, present how does our cities look, how it used to look like, our TV, our music everything... We want you to draw conclusion after seeing our achievement.  It is not a political propaganda, it is simply display how modern China looks like and then you will see the China is way much better than your thought.\n\n2) Freeman follows and some other USA scholarship are truly brain washing. They try to convince participants that they should use their experience to tell Chinese people what their government or society should be by letting them talking to normal people. But they ignore the face that what fits for America doesn't necessarily fit for China. For example, like direct election. There will be lot of bribery happened in the undeveloped area. \n\n3) True, the whole \"Confucius Institute\" program seems like a little bit political. But please understand that there exist too many misunderstanding regrading China. It is one of government's responsibility to clarify these worries. Isn't that also what USA try to do in Cuba by building culture center to let Cuban people a real America for good? We admit that we are not a real democratic country but please don't just look that part, there is also a part that you will be amazed. For example, I am a Chinese student. I like my life and my country. Though I can't use Facebook or Twitter but I still have many interesting to do. I can criticize my government if I have enough evidence showing I am right. If a local government office is corrupted I can still tell media to expose that. We are more open and transparent than you think! A fun fact, Chinese government does not have my fingerprint but USA government does! Who can tell what does that mean? It is really important for USA people know that because it already affects the business and career of normal Chinese people' lifes.  (US government rejected Huawei's acquisition , Harder for Chinese Students to Get a Work Visa in US, Worriedthat outsourced and cheap Chinese products will hit American economy) It is important for everyone know we are open and clean.\n\nSo yes, be open mind, you will see a different China through \"Confucius Institute\" Don't you enjoy the diversity Japan Garden brought to campus?\n\n\n\n To the rest of the world, what you are saying may sound brainwashed. Adult citizens being told by their government what they can and cannot do with regard to basic things like accessing information on the internet or how many children you can have will sound like a basic human rights violation to many people. From what I hear:\n\n1. The government severely restricts/monitors the internet (Facebook, twitter, certain Google searches. Surprisingly reddit is still not blocked, maybe the government doesn't know about it?). If you don't know what happens in the rest of the world and your government controls what information you can access, the way China is ruled will be the only way you know and it will seem normal to you.\n1. You don't elect your government, you have no say in how your country is run.\n1. There is a big divide between the rich and the poor - you allow the US and other developed countries to use your severly underpaid countrymen and women to produce goods for these countries.\n1. Your government tells you how many kids you can have. If you have a second one by mistake, your choices are to pay a hefty fine or abort it. Since boy children are more valued in China, I hear female foeticide is pretty common - since they can have only one child, they want it to be a boy, leading to a skewed sex ratio.\n1. The government rules with an iron fist, not allowing any dissidents, and [didn't allow the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo to accept his prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo#Nobel_Peace_Prize), and initially even censored information about him winning the prize. \n\nI think people who grew up in a democracy would find it very disconcerting if they had no choice in electing leaders or affecting laws and policies, and if their government gets to decide what is best for them. Believe or not, you can everything you said in China are just be fine.Because we are not Iran or North Korea, to some extent, we do have speech freedom. You can say everything above we already got answer for you:\n1.True. Block information sucks. But one thing about social network is that there too many rumors. And normally people just tend to believe these rumors because they don't trust anyone besides their own family.  If you use the Chinese social website, you are personnel information will be recorded but only authorized government staffs know. So in future if anyone lied to your friend about you on Facebook and want to get evidence, they can resort to government. It is a compromising solution that both protect privacy and stop rumors.\n\n2. Election means money. We don't want to waste money on election if you no big change will be made if you elected both party.  But we do have congress called Ren min dai bao da hui , where people elected one of their neighbor represent them to reflect their concerns to government. It is kind of election. Many people hadn't done that but from inner news I have heard that, government is working on that. Soon not only people live in rural area but also people live in urban area will also get chance to elect their Ren Min Dai Biao.\n\n3.True there is big divide but another thing is living cost in China is dramatically varies in different area of China. Living cost (food electricity and housing ) will have no big difference (more than 50%) between Illinois and Montana but living cost of Beijing or Shanghai could be 100 times of the living cost of the undeveloped western China. There isn't lots of people suffered from hunger. (It is kind a big achievement, if you don't believe it, take look of India, still there are lot of people in India are suffer from hunger). The difference of rich and poor people are decreasing now because a new amendment just passed last week to charge rich people more tax and use these money to help poor people( like Obama did. But still, the tax we charged is still far less than the tax Obama charged)  So, the difference is not that big and we are working on that.\n\n4) To be fair, if we don't control population , we won't have enough food or resource, seriously can you feed those extra babies? How about let half of Chinese population immigrate to USA? We are also working on that, here is our policy now 1) if you are a minority you can still have more than one child. that's our respect to minority race , for example like Tibetatian 2) if both you and your wife are from single-child family, you are allowed to have more than one child \n\n5) Liu Xiaobo commit a criminal, trying to make a riot. You can't just based on his word, you should really say what he did. He believed that people lived in western country are more educated and thus these western countries should colonized China for 300 years to help us get used to democrat system. What a bullshit! He said lots of racist words too. (He is a racist of his own race. I feel like he just simply hate of being a Chinese and wished to born as a American white male.) And also his word did bother some innocent peoples's life and according to law he should lived in jail. Everything is legal, if you don't believe that you can check our court record. We have enough evidence to sue him. Prisoners should not leave the jail.\n\nTrue, many Chinese people are complaining about our government. But there are way much people believe that by their hard working can bring fortune to themselves and bring prosper to country. In fact, if you ask a random Chinese student in Champaign, they will say appreciate their life today and do not want the democratic changes affects our society. Government are also changing for them by putting effort on issues they really care like education (college tuition is way much cheaper in China) or health care( Beijing residents can get most of the money they spend on medical service refunded ).

I see them working very hard (at least the graduate students), so I wonder why they would need to cheat. That is my observation for undergrads only. I don't personally know any grad students that cheat, nor have I heard of anyone in my department blatantly cheating.  This is really interesting. I had a friend in MSE 401 last semester who observed that during an in-class quiz, one international student, wearing a white hoodie, asked to go to the bathroom, and another international student, this one wearing a purple hoodie, came back.\nWhat saddened me most about this was that it was unclear whether anything was done about this at all- I imagine it would have been pretty easy to prove that there was something academically dishonest going on. Your friend should have said something after class. Professor Dillon would have at least started watching that student more closely.  Remember kids, crime pays.  Anyone have a screenshot of the message that was posted? It has now disappeared.

There must be many Chinese people on /r/uiuc - please clarify this for the rest of us. Do the others who read those boards simply accept it as normal and look the other way and leave these posts unreported? Even OP calls themself \"wasnotmybusiness\".

During one of our \"ethics\" lectures, we had a group of chinese students argue with the professor that if you're sick for a week and can't make it to lecture, it's perfectly okay to copy your friend's homework since \"it wasn't your fault\". A large group of them also got caught buying past exams (which weren't supposed to be available) and when the professor found out they complained because they bought them fair and square. The entire exam results were thrown out.\n\nThings like this seemed much more common with the Chinese students than the other international groups. It's not that they want to be lazy --its the opposite.

So we would get paid 8.25 X 4 hours for 8 hours of manual labor.\n\nAlso college works takes like 30% and i think the district manager takes 10-15% you also pay for equipment and supplies so if you really wanted to do this do it yourself and you could make a hell of a lot more.

Anyone with a lot of friends would be able to do the same thing. Whether they were in a fraternity or not. I know but that's not really the point.  Why? Any social person could do the same thing. Anyone in say the rock climbing club could easily get all their rock climbing friends to vote for them. Do you really expect antisocial people to do as well in elections as social people? Politics shouldn't be dependent on who you know. It can be dependent on popularity, but only if that popularity is drawn from support for your political ideals. I doubt people who know a candidate for their rockclimbing skills would be informed of their politics.  Well then leave frat's out of it because it's a political problem bro.\n Sorry I didn't mean it to come off as such.

How is banning smoking expensive? A) Enforcing the ban costs money (staff, processing)\n\nB) Setting up places to sequester the smokers (smoking huts, designated areas, etc)\n\nDo you have an idea of how much just those goddamn metal signs cost? It's ridiculous and most of of all DOES NOT MAKE THIS CAMPUS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE CASH-COW THAT IS INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS Two points:\n\n1) ISS did not sponsor or support the smoking ban. Regardless of what University officials may have said, the ban was conceived and promoted by the former Student Trustee - an elected official beyond the control of the ISS.\n\nI for one hate smoking, but a total ban on a campus this size is ill-advised and a clear violation of personal freedom.\n\n2) As a member of the Academic (faculty-student) Senate's committee on University Student Life, I don't remember smoking shelters or designated areas coming up in discussion. I wouldn't expect to see any. 1) The resources of the campus police or whoever would be enforcing this waste of time are not infinite, and either the university must spend more to add officers to not cut on policing elsewhere or they will be tied up doing garbage like citing people for smoking instead of driving around giving jaywalking tickets like we need them to (sarcasm on that last bit...) And yes, the funds for this sort of thing won't come from the ISS but they have to come from somewhere and I sure as shootin' know UIUC is not running a massive surplus.\n\n2) The shelters and such had been discussed by various people involved with the ban in the past, didn't realize there wasn't an a policy of \"hit the bricks, asshole\" instead of one of accomodation. Actually, it looks like they are going for more of a 'hit the bricks, asshole' approach.\n\nhttp://www.campusrec.illinois.edu/Smoke-Free/faq.html\n\n&gt;Question: Will there be designated smoking areas on campus?\n&gt;\nNo. Smoking will be prohibited on all campus grounds. There are two reasons for this:\n&gt;\nEstablishing designated smoking areas undermines the new policy. The purpose of the policy is to create a health-supporting community for everyone, tobacco-users and non-users alike. Creating smoking areas does not contribute to that purpose.\n&gt;\nSmoking zones and perimeter policies have not been found to be effective or enforceable, and smoking shelters are expensive to construct and maintain. Campuses with full smoke-free policies have reported fewer problems with compliance than policies that include smoking areas.  But guys, if we don't fund the Student Senate, then how else will they be able to pay for [more than $9,000 in self-advertisement?](http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/article_8b09184a-47e2-11e2-af22-001a4bcf6878.html)\n\nSeriously, I hate our student government for shit like this.  If other RSOs need to raise their own money if they want more than basic funding, why does the student government deserve special treatment? I can literally think of dozens of better ways to spend that money on campus.  Why give it to a bunch of entitled, self-involved clowns?\n\n1) Repaint the bike lanes on campus\n2) Improve CITES infrastructure/staff\n3) Build/improve bus shelters on some of the more common stops on campus\n4) Fix some of the aging AV systems in the classrooms on campus\n5) Better quality toilet paper for the restrooms on campus\n6) Improve the desks/chairs in some of the older classrooms\n7) Investigate safer ways to route street traffic through/around campus\n8) A student sponsored scholarship for underprivileged or underrepresented students\n9) An annual campus wide reward to recognize outstanding instructors\n10) Improve the security systems on the dormitories\n11) Pay for campus police to do extra patrols of some of the more dangerous areas on campus\n12) Replace/repair some of the damaged equipment in the ARC\n\nAnd those are just off the top of my head. To address your concerns:\n\n1. I've been told that Urbana and Champaign actually own these. Although that never made much sense to me, you'd get more traction calling your City Councilperson.\n2. Does anything in particular bother you about CITES?\n3. Again, I'm not sure if the shelters belong to the University or MTD. I'll look into it. Any stops in particular you'd like to see? (I spend most of my time north of Green, so I'm not ideally placed to know about the southern bus routes.)\n4. ISS once tried to have a ceiling projector installed in a room at the Union. The University wanted $15,000 just to install the mounting bracket and power outlet. That should give some perspective on how much an AV system costs.\n5. God yes, though I would wager the budget for toilet paper is more than any twenty students pay in tuition.\n6. Last I heard, the state of Illinois owes the University tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars for maintenance and renovation projects. Combine that with a multi-year planning, purchasing, and evaluation process, and renovating one classroom or lab can take the better part of a decade and $100,000. The Academic (faculty-student) Senate has started a lobbying effort with the state legislature to fix some of these issues, but it's going to be an uphill battle.\n7. There are Campus Committees dedicated to this kind of thing, but they often lack students willing offer input. [Apply here](http://www.iss.illinois.edu/ccapplication.aspx).\n8. Agreed.\n9. University administrators giving large cash gifts to faculty? That sounds like a recipe for corruption to me, but I'm a bit of a cynic. The ISS [gives out \"Teaching Excellence Awards\" annually](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/16wadn/seeking_nominations_for_teaching_excellence_awards/) by the way, based on student nominations.\n10. As a graduate student, I'm not familiar with security at the student dorms. Anything particularly concerning there?\n11. I agree that we need to up police presence on campus at night. I did my undergraduate at Virginia Tech, and the campus police there were far more active at night than here.\n12. Campus Rec receives a very generous budget from the University and student fees. If something is broken and not fixed quickly, it's most likely not been reported up to the people in charge. I can get you the contact info if you have specifics.\n\nAnything else? That was super interesting and informative, and I can tell you put a lot of thought and effort into it.  Thank you!  If I could transfer my karma down here to get more attention to your post, I would do it.  People should definitely read it.  I'm not going to do a point by point response to distract from it (but I do want to discuss all of this more!)\n\nThe reason for my list was more to make the point that an increase in tuition should go toward improving the life of students on campus, and that I could easily think of some of those ways off the top of my head.  Maybe they're not all practical, but there's obviously a lot we could do.  I don't really see student government taking the lead on these kinds of issues.

Keep in mind that number is for... you know... *actual businesses*. Unless they're swimming in printer ink, I refuse to believe that they can run through that much money.\n\nI hope that their actual *spending* was nowhere near the amount that they *budgeted*. The average business doesn't have to print out **54 copies of everything**.\n\nBecause each senator has to receive the agenda, minutes, and pieces of proposed legislation in print at the meetings, the ISS goes through a mountain of paper and ink - even printing two pages per side and double-sided. (It has been suggested that this be done digitally only, but that would unfairly exclude student senators unable to afford electronics.) Then you start piling on staples, binders (for storing all those documents until the session ends), pens, printer repair/replacement costs...\n\nI don't think the amount spent comes near the budgeted amount in the end, but that budget reflects a sort of worst case scenario. (That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Why not just hold your meetings in a lecture hall with powerpoint capability?   \nCouple that with reminding senators that there are plenty of tech labs on campus, you'd save a significant amount of money on supplies regardless of what it actually is.

(That and I've heard that last year's treasurer was extremely incompetent.)\n Honestly, many students (if not most) have either a laptop or smartphone, or something to read digital documents off of. And if they don't they can print out a copy before the meeting.   I wish that most of the students who would be voting on this could see the discussion going on here. I feel like a big problem in this referendum wll be all the students who don't know anything about the issue (myself included) who read the question and say \"meh, 2 dollars, no big deal, and anyway it boosts student power\" and don't know exactly what the ISS does. To this date I still don't know what the ISS does, all I've seen are ads from them. Frankly I think my residence hall's executive board puts on better events than they do, and their funding comes from the University Housing payments so they're not about to charge students just to entertain them. When is voting going on?\nI did not hear about this until I saw this thread and I can't find information about this online.    I am a prior Student Senator. I think that the separate fee is not a good pursuit of the Student Senate's time and energy. The Student Senate had significant independence some time ago (pre-2008 IIRC) and it resulted in some heavy corruption, but also a huge restructuring by the Senate in self-policing and oversight. While I was there, we had great Treasurers that ensured everything was financially accounted for, and frequently wound up . That said, the Student Senate can often get a little bit pushed around by the University administration to toe the line on some issues, so I can understand their desire to obtain financial independence from what the administration deigns to provide.\n\nSecond, people have asked what Student Senate even does. Are there a lot of fratstars in the Senate? Sure. It's a power position, it's bound to attract those kinds of people. However, we do a variety of things for the student body:\n\n-Lobbying Springfield on behalf of the student body and University (this is probably where most of the phone bill cost comes from). We also host the cost of bus transportation for the student body to assist on Illinois Day with lobbying.\n\n-Educating students about their rights regarding interactions with police. Given the degree of intoxication that goes on, we do this several times a year to try and provide some legal knowledge to the student body.\n\n-Hosting the Student Trustee debate (arguably the most important position in the student body)\n\n-Determining better use of traffic systems (I saw this point come up further down the page). There are committees that actually manage this. I was on one myself.\n\n-Serving as the sounding board of the student body. You get a diverse array of opinions in 40,000 students, and while individual groups can push for action on an issue, we serve as a way to pare down all those different opinions into one that is easily digestible by the administration. Dear God, you should have seen the debates that occurred about the administration's actions taken during the Next Dance.\n\n-Finally, I won't mince words. We also serve as an extra funding board for student issues. This can range from assisting Habitat for Humanity, multicultural social events, graduate student town halls, or environmental action nights. $9,000 on just advertising is a lot to drop and plain ridiculous. That would eliminate numerous valuable events that could have been held, and Activity Day is actually a better return on our investment ($12 registration fee for a table netting hundreds of interested students).\n\n**Source:** I am a former Student Senator, 2009-2010, and literally drafted by my classmates (I didn't choose to run until they put me on the ballot and voted me in based on my advocacy work regarding the MTD cuts that year). I got to experience developing the student body's stance on issues including the clout scandal and Chief's Next Dance). Thank you for giving us an insider's perspective.  If I may ask, how important do you think the student government's independence from the administration is?  Is the $60,000+ budget they are asking for justifiable, or is there a significant amount of wasted spending there?\n\nI ask because I there are some items from last year's spending--such as thousands spent on some sort of Big 10 student government conference--make me curious whether some money is spent on the senators and not on the functioning of the senate.\n\n(edit: some words)  No. As a suggestion, they can fine the smoking people and make that money.  This is actually how the first student government at UIUC funded themselves. Later governments stopped because it was really, really annoying... I was being sarcastic actually. Although I don't smoke I have no problem with the people smoking outside.

The really sad thing is that the senate is getting away from their true purpose and that is to stand up for the students not promote themselves through outrageous $9000 cheesy advertisements at sporting events.  I wasn't able to attend last weeks meeting, but since I was recently reappointed, I had a couple of senators on my behalf fight against a fund allocation for a 10 dollar name plate for me. I didn't want it, and I sure didn't want my constituents money spent on something that serves absolutely no purpose.  That is approximately 500 bucks wasted every year on stupid name plates.  Well apparently, there was a movement to amend the fund allocation to remove my nameplate, and it failed.  Fiscal irresponsibility at it's finest right there, and there is no reason there should be an additional fee if the ISS can't spend it's current budget wisely.

In my opinion, ISS continues to push itself further into obscurity.  Things have gotten notably worse within the organization.  They seem to spend a majority of their time talking about fund allocations and internal procedure, and less time on ways to represent students.  I can't say that I've ever heard more people use the word \"distinguished\" in a single meeting.     Is there a timeline for when this will be brought up in a meeting or when students can vote?     Many people here do not have a lot of money and many of them are on student loans. As a result, they should not be forced to pay additional fees, especially if there are having difficulty paying for tuition. If they want to implement a mandatory fee, it should only be for people who have extra money to spend.\n\nIf the Student Government needs money, I will gladly donate at least $10 if they give me an easy way to do so such as allowing me to charge the donation to my student account.\n  http://iss.illinois.edu/documents.asp\n\nA link to the ISS governing documents and their site for anyone who wants to look at such things.

If I was the readmission person in charge of reviewing your application, and you said exactly what you just said, I would have no problem with bringing you back in. Further, you admit that there were some classes you had difficulty with. That's no biggie. I did community college for a few semesters and not everything was As. As long as you're upfront about it, and explain what was difficult, I bet you'll be good (I had problems with discrete math, it just wasn't my forte). I do hope to write something similar in my petition although in the actual directions for the petition it warns against superficial claims. This makes me worry that some of the stuff won't be taken seriously when it's actually huge change/improvement for me. Either way your post made me feel good and a little more optimistic! Thank you!  Yes.  I made an appointment to talk to the department's Dean personally, so I could talk over the circumstances that had led to my awful semester, the game plan for improving my performance and keeping myself on track, and generally just try to make the best impression possible.  It worked.  I was dropped in spring 12 also, and I'm trying to transfer to UIC because I think it might be easier to get into. Am I wrong? Is it still the same process since it is within the University of Illinois system? I never looked into UIC.\n\nedit: By same process I mean; do you fill out a petition or is it like applying to any other University? I think it's like applying to another University. They do ask if you've been in the U of I system to provide your UIN, so it's different in that aspect. Hopefully since I've been in the system they'll accept me.  I was dropped and readmitted in 2004. I had some time to show that I had become more responsible and was ready to make the appropriate commitment. Before reapplying I spoke with a counselor who reminded me that I was let into the university originally because they thought I was capable. Focusing on your growth and changes you've made, as Hippity suggested, is really sound advise. Remember your previous success and don't doubt you can do it. I was nervous reapplying but when I got back in, it was like a new lease on life. Good luck! Numerous counselors have given me the exact same advice. Whenever I get down on myself I think about that and it gives me hope. They let me in this University once, it shouldn't be unreasonable to think that I could make it back. It's nice to hear from someone who made it back! Thanks!  Yep. I did just that and an in my 1st full year back after doin a year at a CC. I spoke to my counselor during the reapplication period to make sure all my T's were crossed and I's dotted, and I heard back within around 2 weeks. If you can give them some solid and legitimate reasoning behind why you were dropped and how you plan to change that I've heard the odds are typically good for readmittance.  Just wondering. What do you mean by crossing T's and dotting I's? I've spoken with the secretary for the deans at engineering hall about getting the actual petition form and then again to clear up some questions I had, but I've never actually sat down and talked my situation through with someone.

Amazing guy Haha, I've heard that you can go in there, have a really friendly chat with him, but not actually get an answer to your question.  This exact story has led to most of the really really sad endings that I have witnessed for UIUC students. If you ever get a C+ or lower in a math, chem, or CS class, the Engineering college will tell you to keep retaking courses until you have a high enough GPA to transfer. This causes a ridiculously high amount of denial and retakes among undeclared students. When you fail Chem 102 and retake it, getting a C, your GPA is terrible. The kicker: if you don't have at least a 2.0 overall GPA after 2 years, *it is impossible to transfer to any major*. \n\n* If you get a C+ or lower in a math or chem or CS class, abandon your plan.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my personal opinion and like I said this is not the official stance of the Engineering college or the Engineering advisers. I'm not even sure it is the official stance of the undeclared advisers. \n\nThe lesson that OP should take from this is that if you got rejected from the major you wanted, you should think seriously about coming here. There is absolutely no guarantee that you will transfer, and you should not come unless there are multiple majors that you would be happy completing. A student without a backup plan is in a very risky situation. A student with a backup plan is totally ok! There's a lot of realistic advice here, but I had a different story. I ended up getting a C- in math 241, with D's and F's in my other classes. I actually got placed on academic probation cause my gpa was so low but I still went to see one of the assistant deans about transferring into MechE. He literally told me that I had no chance of transferring in and even if I got A's for every class from there on out, I still wouldn't get in. It was heart-breaking at the time but I'm pretty stubborn. Long story short, I worked my ass off for a year, and without getting all A's or anywhere close to the \"required\" 3.8, still managed to transfer successfully. My roommate just transferred into CS as well, and while it wasn't pretty, since I don't think he even had a 3.0, he still ended up getting in. So I guess everyone's story is different.

Long story short, I worked my ass off for a year, and without getting all A's or anywhere close to the \"required\" 3.8, still managed to transfer successfully. My roommate just transferred into CS as well, and while it wasn't pretty, since I don't think he even had a 3.0, he still ended up getting in. So I guess everyone's story is different.  This exact story has led to most of the really really sad endings that I have witnessed for UIUC students. If you ever get a C+ or lower in a math, chem, or CS class, the Engineering college will tell you to keep retaking courses until you have a high enough GPA to transfer. This causes a ridiculously high amount of denial and retakes among undeclared students. When you fail Chem 102 and retake it, getting a C, your GPA is terrible. The kicker: if you don't have at least a 2.0 overall GPA after 2 years, *it is impossible to transfer to any major*. \n\n* If you get a C+ or lower in a math or chem or CS class, abandon your plan.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my personal opinion and like I said this is not the official stance of the Engineering college or the Engineering advisers. I'm not even sure it is the official stance of the undeclared advisers. \n\nThe lesson that OP should take from this is that if you got rejected from the major you wanted, you should think seriously about coming here. There is absolutely no guarantee that you will transfer, and you should not come unless there are multiple majors that you would be happy completing. A student without a backup plan is in a very risky situation. A student with a backup plan is totally ok! Mr academic advisor sir, what GPA's do you normally see getting accepted into engineering CS and LAS CS + math? I don't know about engineering CS, because I'm not a CS adviser. Sorry! I do know that they would love to take people and they aren't being jerks, but they refuse to take so many people that CS 225 will overfill. It makes sense, really.\n\nLAS math/cs has a straight-up transfer criterion but it is 3.20 GPA in specific difficult courses, which is really hard. I like guaranteed transfer criteria. But they cause problems for high-demand courses. See http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/programs/declaring/ for LAS's transfer criteria. Just as an advisor, how do you really feel about DGS here?

Like others have said, transferring to CS from undeclared will be very, very difficult.\n\nAs someone who hires people for IT positions, I would likely put someone with a CS degree or a CS minor for many positions. If on the other hand, you are really wanting to be a programmer's programmer, CS is almost certainly where you want to end up. In my experience, being a programmer and having a CS degree from UofI are two very separate things.  Almost every class tells you that they are teaching you concepts, not how to program.

I transferred into engineering after attending Parkland for 2 years, no one I knew who applied to transfer to an engineering program got denied (granted everyone I knew who was applying at a 3.0 or higher).  From what I have heard, it is actually easier to transfer from another school than to transfer from another college at UIUC.  If I had to do it over again, I would start at Parkland again, the quality of teaching for the basic calculus and physics is worlds better than what I saw at UIUC.   I transferred into Computer Engineering after 3 semesters at a community college. I've been told the same thing, outside transfers are easier (as long as you're an Illinois resident). [deleted] Are you sure you want to transfer that late? Why not apply to transfer for this coming fall? I see no benefit in waiting another 1.5 years. I'm getting a full ride at UIC right now (grants cover everything) and by the time I transfer for Junior year I'll have $15k+ saved from my job, which would put me on track for graduating with zero debt. So there's that.  The CS department has an increasing enrollment, and is trying to prevent hordes of students from transferring in, and in particular, it is going to be harder to do it in the future. This said, if you have high GPA - you are always going to be able to transfer in. After all - why would CS not want to accept *good* students?\n\nThis said, if you got accepted to CE in ECE then it is very similar to CS. It is a good program in a good department, and you should completely go for it.\n  Are you Undeclared as in you are in DGS or in Undeclared as in the new Undeclared option for Engineering?   I am in the same boat. \n\nhttp://provost.illinois.edu/programs/advising/ICT%20Engineering.html\n\n\nThis should help. Notice that there is **no GPA that guarantees transfer** to engineering, please. And a 3.0 is not a trivial task when your schedule is calculus, physics, chemistry, and rhetoric. So what is the relevance of my link? Is it a guideline or...? It's a minimum. If you read it closely, you'll note that it says if you meet those requirements they \"will consider\" you for transfer.  So what are more realistic requirements? If a person can maintain an A/B/B+ average while completing all of the Junior year transfer requirements, and demonstrate that they taught themselves the basics of a programming language in their free time by then - that's a pretty good indication of probable success completing the degree. It is a difficult program, but it's worth it and very doable with dedication.  I know people who have done it, but I'm sure it's hard. Also you contribute to the overscheduling of classes (as in there are too many people who sign up for classes and there aren't enough seats.) But good luck, the CS program is awesome. It's not too bad. Did it fall of last year, and all Herzog wanted was to see if I did well in CS 173, CS 225, and ECE 190.  What was your GPA?    also consider the Math and Computer Science and Statistics and Computer Science programs, as both are LAS. No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option It doesn't hold the same value, or students don't perceive it to hold the same value. Nobody ever asked me what department I got my degree in. Just what I got.  They don't have to ask if it's on your resume \"BS in Mathematics and Computer Science\" doesn't sound any worse than \"BS in Computer Science.\" No one is going to pay attention to whether your degree comes from LAS/Engineering.  No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option No offense but this does not hold nearly the same value, which is why a lot of people don't see that as a option  Me too :/ Except civil engineering, is it any different for me than OP?  Undecided student here. CS is hard as hell to transfer into. The GPA requirement doesn't seem like it's that hard, but it is much harder than it looks. A B- is actually weighed as a 2.67, not a 3, so be wary of that as well. Also, the GPA requirement is more like a 3.2 for CS, not 3.0 So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in? So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in? So I guess getting that 3.2 GPA is pretty difficult? Is that because of the classes needed in order to transfer in?   Can anyone explain the differences between the Mathematics and Computer Science program in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as opposed to the one in the College of Engineering? Applied for EE but didn't get into the program and am considering either majors to submit. As the majors state, the LAS one takes more advanced Math classes as opposed to even more advanced CS classes in Engineering. Engineering's CS program only requires all the Calc courses, Linear Algebra, and I believe a Probability Theory class.\n\nEngineering also requires you to take the Physics track (PHYS 211/212 and your choice of 213 or 214) and CHEM 102/103 for their college requirement. \n\nIn the end, they're about equal. Graduates from both programs should show success and proficiency in their future careers.\n\nI dug up some flowcharts.

Any thoughts on that? And what about courses that the course catalog says are \"closed\". I have heard people that can get into these courses somehow?  TSM 311 is a full-semester course. They just do the discussions differently in the first half and second half, so the discussions look like second-half courses. They are not. You can't do TSM 311. (I know because I called them to ask about it last week)\n\nTSM should fix the course schedule so that this course does not display as a second-eight-week course, but that definitely won't happen for this semester. This is helpful, thanks.\nThey really should somehow group the discussion sections with lecture sections so this doesn't happen  Any QI or QII ones out there? Atms 120 is a quant II.

Thank you for your time!   I was recently banned by Suburban Express.  Having lost my ticket at the last minute, I had to go print out another one and arrived at the bus three minutes late -- I checked.  As I neared ISR, I saw that they still had a couple people boarding the bus.  When the guy in charge of directing the passengers to the appropriate bus saw me approaching, he yelled, \"If you want to catch this bus, you'd better start running!\"  He then proceeded to berate and me and two other guys for arriving late, yelling at us while we stowed our luggage, \"Who the hell do you think you are?  You're holding up a whole bus load of people!\"  After our luggage was stowed, he continued to yell at us about how inconsiderate we were and how we were banned from every using the service again.  Once we were on the bus, turned to the driver and said, \"Can you believe these fucking people?\"\n\nHonestly, I know I was late -- I'm not excusing myself.  In fact, I expected that the bus would have already left or that I would not be allowed on.  I would have understood and been okay with either of those outcomes.  However, I found it extremely unprofessional to be yelled and cursed at for being late.  The bus driver, though, was really nice about the whole thing.  Seeing how shaken I was after the whole thing, he offered me a bottle of water and tried to comfort me, saying that he \"didn't believe in taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, when I asked the bus driver who the guy was, he said that he didn't know.  Given that he was wearing a Suburban Express shirt, I assumed that he was an employee of Suburban Express and unconnected with the charter company driving the bus.  \n\nOn a completely different note, another time that I rode Suburban Express, the driver missed the exit to the Northbrook Court stop.  Despite the GPS repeatedly telling him to exit, he also missed the next several exits and didn't turn around until a passenger went to tell him that he missed the exit.\n\nOn the other hand, I almost never ride LEX due to the mechanical failures of their buses.

They were obsessed with LEx when it was there, and they cannot let go of it even when it is gone.     As much as I hate Suburban because they're assholes, I swore I would never take Lex after last year. They were almost always late, sometimes by more than an hour, which was annoying. But not too awful. But the thing that finally made me say enough was the time I took a bus back to Champaign at night, and the headlights of the bus weren't working. At all. And yet we drove all the way back to Champaign in the pitch dark. Driving at night without headlights is illegal in Illinois. I'm quite surprised they weren't pulled over by state police, because they're mainly in charge of enforcing imminent mechanical vehicle regulations, just like anyone else can get pulled over and written up for a traffic violation for driving without headlights.\n\nThanks for the response, please get in touch! Since you've researched the matter, which states allow one to drive at night without headlights? I'm curious. I didn't mean to imply there were any states that do allow driving without headlights at night. But if you're that curious, you could probably start [here](http://www.dmv.org/il-illinois/safety-laws.php). It really depends on the vehicle code of the state you're in. It may not be specifically illegal depending on the cop/lawyer you're dealing with, but it's an easy way to be cited for reckless and dangerous driving and grant probable cause for a traffic stop anyways.

The ISS is currently funded by the University's Office of Student Affairs, from general student fee money. The second question aims to replace this money with a direct student fee. This is intended to make the student government directly accountable to students and open up it's funding to review by the Student Fee Advisory Committee in the same way fees for McKinley, Krannert, and Assembly Hall are reviewed and require renewal periodically by referenda vote. At $1.00/semester, this would account for slightly less than a doubling of the ISS's funding, iirc.

The original amendment was going to be \"Do you approve of the reorganization and existence of the student government through...\".

We have United States senators we elect to concern themselves with these issues. We have the ISS to deal with campus issues.  That depends, how many hundreds of dollars worth of cupcakes will this cost us all?    ~~What confuses me is how the sponsors chose to introduce this resolution. Had they submitted it the Sunday before the meeting, it would have been placed on the agenda **automatically** and would have been referred to a committee like any other resolution. Instead they decided to amend the agenda after the meeting began, forcing this awkward confrontation and the failed vote. I don't understand their thinking...~~\n\nThat being said, I have to side with the Treasurer on this one. If a student group wants the ISS's help to lobby their Congressional representatives, then that's fine - that's part of why ISS exists. But ISS shouldn't act as a means to condemn things \"as the Official Voice of the Student Body\", especially on issues where they lack the perspective to make a truly informed choice.\n\n**Update:** I was contacted by a source close to the matter shortly after posting. According to this source, the resolution was submitted prior to the Sunday deadline, but was not added to the agenda. After contacting another source close to the agenda setting process, I was informed that the submitted resolution lacked a sponsor, precluding its consideration and thus addition to the agenda. I'm not really sure what to conclude from all this, but that's the update. I've stricken the first paragraph of this post to mark the error, but I think it's still worth reading if you're interested in submitting a resolution to ISS at some future date. [deleted]   This is crap. Disband them immediately. CBoidy, I agree with you! How can the ISS exist if their constituents dont WANT them to exist? To be fair this comment was sarcastic. It would be by and large a waste of time to cover the topic.\n\nThat said, I still think they should be disbanded in favor of a more representative system. Though I cannot speak to the mechanism that would be at work in such a system. In order to be more representative, people have to care. How many students even know that ISS exists, let alone what it does?    There are Israeli students whose homes and families are affected by a nuclear Iran.  There are Iranian students who are affected by the Iranian regime and its human rights record.  Why shouldn't the ISS tackle this issue? By that logic, we should be condemning numerous countries because of their human rights issues, including Israel. We can't just pick and choose which countries to publicly condemn, especially if the whole student body does not agree with it.  ISS is a representative government, not a direct democracy.  In a representative government, the leaders decide what is best.   There are Israeli students whose homes and families are affected by a nuclear Iran.

Look for \"soxmas.mpg\"  i myself forwarded that video probably 15 or 20 times.....\n\nedit....looks like I've forgotten the timeline for video formats... it was \"soxmas.mov\" Hahaha - it is still here!!  \n\n**[Wrong One - see the comment below by never-rong!]**\n\nhttp://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/soxmas/so-frosty.mov\n\nThe account belongs to Tim Skirvin who I believe used to run the local usenet-server after the UIUC shut down the local uiuc.edu newsserver.  :)  It's about 4 minutes long and really bad video quality, unfortunately.  But still funny.\n\nEdit- UH.. it appears that Tim Skirvin was the first to put it online at UIUC!  ha! :)  I think someone should get some sort of compensation... maybe 10% finders fee from comedy central?  ;) You linked the wrong one......the **ORIGINAL**, however is in that directory as well....\n\nhttp://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/soxmas/soxmas.mov\n\nAt the time 50mb was *HUGE* file to move around.  Lots of people outside the dorms had *dialup*, so that took a long time to download and a lot of effort to keep your housemates off the phone long enough. Hahaha - it is still here!!  \n\n**[Wrong One - see the comment below by never-rong!]**\n\nhttp://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/soxmas/so-frosty.mov\n\nThe account belongs to Tim Skirvin who I believe used to run the local usenet-server after the UIUC shut down the local uiuc.edu newsserver.  :)  It's about 4 minutes long and really bad video quality, unfortunately.
