It stemmed from my often switching between several languages - C, Python, Haskell, Prolog, Java - based on what I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their favorite language and each language has a domain in which it is most applicable. C is favored by people that like to be &amp;quot;close to the metal&amp;quot;, Haskell is the champion of the functional world, Prolog is the leading declarative language, and Python is some amalgamation of several paradigms and is very popular. Each of these is different but they have some common elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each has some sort of integer representation, for example. With care, one should be able to create a system that translates between, say, arrays in C and lists in Python, converting an (int*) to a Python list and back. Would it be possible to create an environment in which one could easily switch between languages for different sections of a program?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a pseudocode example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;common_variable List(Integer) myData;\ncommon_variable String filename;\n\nfunction C void complicatedSort(...) {}\nfunction Python List filterByFile(...) {}\nfunction Haskell List generateList(...) {}\n\nmyData = filterByFile(generateList(myData), filename);\ncomplicatedSort(myData);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;where the third function might use Haskell&amp;#39;s expressivity to generate a list based on some logic that would be best expressed in Haskell and return a List type, which would be passed to the second function to be filtered in a Python list comprehension that compares against the contents of a file, and finally given to C to be sorted efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the best example, but it illustrates what I had in mind - write the more abstract / higher level code in, say, a functional language, pass it to another for IO, pass it to a lower level language for computational efficiency. A better example might be to a definite clause grammar in Prolog to analyze some text, making into a tree with semantic labels and word senses attached, passed to Haskell for intelligent and concise tree operations, passed to C to be used for analysis using the GSL library on a supercomputing cluster using a gigantic dataset pulled from the internet and initially parsed by Python using the BeautifulSoup module.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should be possible by carefully choosing a collection of primitive types that can be translated into the format a particular language uses, transform the data as necessary when passing it to a function in the language, transforming back that function&amp;#39;s return value, and re-translating it for a function in another language, and so on. This common environment&amp;#39;s main purpose would simply be formatting data in memory so as to be passed to function blocks written in whatever language is chosen for the actual work to be done, the environment not really being part of the program logic, which would be executed by a code block in an existing language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This environment would have its own compiler that would generate a symbol table and the other standard portions of an executable. Each code block in its own language would then be compiled using that language&amp;#39;s compiler but with the shared symbols table etc. passed so that the different parts could interoperate, and the final program generated would be native machine code. The result would be speedier development without much of a performance tradeoff. The programmer could switch between conciseness of expression and efficiency of computation as appropriate to the program subroutine being written.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has something like this been attempted? Are there difficulties preventing such an environment that I&amp;#39;m not seeing? I think that it would be useful and that it would be feasible, but I&amp;#39;ve only barely scratched the surface of language design and so am not qualified to judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps the main difficulty here would be that one would need a good programming language designer as well as at least one person per language that is familiar enough with the corresponding compiler to be able to help with interoperability. It would require an quite a collection of talent from separate areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This idea has been banging around in my head for a while and I thought that this would be a good place to bring it up for discussion as it would entail elements of language design, typeclasses, and so on.

C is favored by people that like to be \"close to the metal\", Haskell is the champion of the functional world, Prolog is the leading declarative language, and Python is some amalgamation of several paradigms and is very popular. Each of these is different but they have some common elements.\n\nEach has some sort of integer representation, for example. With care, one should be able to create a system that translates between, say, arrays in C and lists in Python, converting an (int*) to a Python list and back. Would it be possible to create an environment in which one could easily switch between languages for different sections of a program?\n\nHere's a pseudocode example:\n\n    common_variable List(Integer) myData;\n    common_variable String filename;\n\n    function C void complicatedSort(...) {}\n    function Python List filterByFile(...) {}\n    function Haskell List generateList(...) {}\n\n    myData = filterByFile(generateList(myData), filename);\n    complicatedSort(myData);\n\nwhere the third function might use Haskell's expressivity to generate a list based on some logic that would be best expressed in Haskell and return a List type, which would be passed to the second function to be filtered in a Python list comprehension that compares against the contents of a file, and finally given to C to be sorted efficiently.\n\nIt's not the best example, but it illustrates what I had in mind - write the more abstract / higher level code in, say, a functional language, pass it to another for IO, pass it to a lower level language for computational efficiency. A better example might be to a definite clause grammar in Prolog to analyze some text, making into a tree with semantic labels and word senses attached, passed to Haskell for intelligent and concise tree operations, passed to C to be used for analysis using the GSL library on a supercomputing cluster using a gigantic dataset pulled from the internet and initially parsed by Python using the BeautifulSoup module.\n\nIt should be possible by carefully choosing a collection of primitive types that can be translated into the format a particular language uses, transform the data as necessary when passing it to a function in the language, transforming back that function's return value, and re-translating it for a function in another language, and so on. This common environment's main purpose would simply be formatting data in memory so as to be passed to function blocks written in whatever language is chosen for the actual work to be done, the environment not really being part of the program logic, which would be executed by a code block in an existing language.\n\nThis environment would have its own compiler that would generate a symbol table and the other standard portions of an executable. Each code block in its own language would then be compiled using that language's compiler but with the shared symbols table etc. passed so that the different parts could interoperate, and the final program generated would be native machine code. The result would be speedier development without much of a performance tradeoff. The programmer could switch between conciseness of expression and efficiency of computation as appropriate to the program subroutine being written.\n\nHas something like this been attempted? Are there difficulties preventing such an environment that I'm not seeing? I think that it would be useful and that it would be feasible, but I've only barely scratched the surface of language design and so am not qualified to judge.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**Edit**: Perhaps the main difficulty here would be that one would need a good programming language designer as well as at least one person per language that is familiar enough with the corresponding compiler to be able to help with interoperability.

Do you want to look for work with this degree?\n2. How much do you want to further my understanding of the study of computation and explore it for education's sake?\n3. How much time can you devote to your studies?  Will you be able to make the costs worth your while?\n\nPersonally I think there exist a lot of good resources for exploring the study of computer science, but as far as online courses go, you should be careful.  Even respectable institutions have gotten into the game of offering distances learning packages and degrees, but in my experience it's really about padding the bottom line just about everywhere you look.  I've heard it put before that online courses at many universities are the same as 'charging students course fees and tuition in exchange for access to powerpoint slides'.  Don't believe everything you hear though, especially from people on the Internet like me.  There could exist the perfect school for you online, but I must stress that being skeptical and asking questions is really, really important.  If something doesn't smell right or you feel pressured to make a decision too quickly, back out.  All educational institutions are *selling* you an education and are doing so in a way that suits their own best interests.  You need to suit your own best interests, first and foremost.  Don't worry about hurting somebody's feelings by taking your time committing to a program.\n\nThat being said, I have a few broad suggestions to potentially help you out.\n\n1.  If you are interested in just understanding and learning about CS, there are foundational bits of literature that are touched on in lists in this reddit, I suggest you look them up and check them out.\n\n2. Getting reasonably priced access to these materials will probably require access to a college/university library.  If you're able, try to get access to one by enrolling part time in a class or if they offer it by buying a library membership (or just walking into the library and reading books in there without leaving....if it's a public institution you pay taxes, who cares).  I'm not quite sure how the latter (paying to get a library card) would be done, if it is possible or applicable.\n\n3.  If you want to get a job with a degree, you may need to bite the bullet and go with an online course package.  Then again, maybe you don't.  Any more, hard work and diligence can propel you farther than many University programs can.  I'm in a CS program, and I see undergraduate students coasting through every year...you don't need a degree to \"compete\" with them on an actual skills-based level.\n\n4.  Consider taking courses from a brick and mortar school in an ala cart fashion to make up for gaps in areas you find hard to do on your own.  If you're not interested in getting an actual degree with your coursework, you can sometimes audit the classes at a much lower rate (or maybe even at no cost to you, in my experience it costs *something* though).\n\n5.  If you opt to go on your own path without the college model, plan to work in the CS/Programming/IT realm, you'll need to make up for your lack of college degree by marketing yourself.  This is generally accomplished with a number of different things you can easily do on your own.  Blog about your exploits.  Post your code to github.  Make friends and go to professional meetups (also check out your local startup scene, they're around).

Finally, there are some institutes like UT Austin&amp;#39;s ICES that might also meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5ldxcy", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343620767.0, "created_utc": 1343617167.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_xd0rv", "children": [], "author": "JackedIn", "id": "c5lfrsu", "parent_id": "t3_xd0rv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 3, "body": "Baseball statistician ", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseball statistician &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5lfrsu", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343628538.0, "created_utc": 1343624938.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_xd0rv", "children": [], "author": "necroforest", "id": "c5lbfel", "parent_id": "t3_xd0rv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "You could also look into applied math", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also look into applied math&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5lbfel", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343609914.0, "created_utc": 1343606314.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_xd0rv", "children": [], "author": "hansNS", "id": "c5lctmp", "parent_id": "t3_xd0rv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "Might wanna check out Dalhousie if Canada is a choice for you.\nI know Malcolm Heywood does AI and machine learning, and I think data mining is Dr. Milos but I don't have any personal experience with him; Malcolm is awesome from personal experience.\n\nhttp://cs.dal.ca\n\nhttp://web.cs.dal.ca/~mheywood/", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might wanna check out Dalhousie if Canada is a choice for you.\nI know Malcolm Heywood does AI and machine learning, and I think data mining is Dr. Milos but I don&amp;#39;t have any personal experience with him; Malcolm is awesome from personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cs.dal.ca\"&gt;http://cs.dal.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://web.cs.dal.ca/%7Emheywood/\"&gt;http://web.cs.dal.ca/~mheywood/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5lctmp", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343616196.0, "created_utc": 1343612596.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_xd0rv", "children": [], "author": "artoonie", "id": "c5lfcjx", "parent_id": "t3_xd0rv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "How bout evolutionary theory / biology from a CS perspective?\n\nExample: Read the stuff in the \"Biology\" section here- http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How bout evolutionary theory / biology from a CS perspective?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example: Read the stuff in the &amp;quot;Biology&amp;quot; section here- &lt;a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Echristos/\"&gt;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5lfcjx", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343626610.0, "created_utc": 1343623010.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_xd0rv", "children": [], "author": "[deleted]", "id": "c5lfsqn", "parent_id": "t3_xd0rv", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "There is so much genomic data out there that nobody knows what to do with.

The bane of every programmer, project manager, and city official. Us poor humans are naturally bad at estimating things; especially things we have little experience with.\n\nIf you're curious, I recommend a book by Daniel Kahnman titled \"Thinking: Fast and Slow\". He details many biases and heuristics that we apply without even knowing it and one of them is the \"planning fallacy\". The problem basically comes down to the fact that we don't tend to think about what could go wrong. Instead, we visualize the best-case and maybe add some small fudge factor. The less experience we have, the less we realize how many things could go wrong and the worse we underestimate the time needed.\n\nThe best thing you can do to improve your estimates is to keep track of past endeavors. Record your estimate, what things happened that you didn't expect, and how long it really took. Use that as a baseline when predicting future projects. Try to avoid thinking about what you \"expect\" will happen and instead refer only to your recorded history. You can make small adjustments based on the current situation, if you want, but always use the historical record as the initial estimate and only adjust from there.\n\nAside from that, know that programming is a skill and with experience comes expertise. Even with 10 years of practiced experience, I still find myself taking far longer than I expect when met with a new challenge. For example, I typically write Python code, but took on a side project last year that was more appropriate to do in C#. I spent weeks ahead of time reading up on the language, but every time I sat down to code, I would spend 80-90% of my time reading documentation to figure out the various classes, arguments, and other things that I couldn't possibly have memorized. The same thing happens to me when I use a new module or framework in Python. If I was just writing a simple Python script, I could write a screen full in minutes, but if there is anything I'm not familiar with (be it a module, class, etc.), it could be over an hour while I pour over the documentation. Likewise if a bug occurs that I don't understand; it could be hours to debug it.\n\nAnd the difference in ability between coders can vary a lot. Some past research has shown productivity to vary by a factor of up to 20x, even for people with similar experience in the same company. The difference between a freshman in college and an experienced, full-time programmer is likely much more than that. As you learn and gain experience, you will improve. Typing speed, memory, debugging skills; everything becomes easier and faster.\n\nAs others have mentioned, one thing you can do to help yourself out is to test as you go. Writing a thousand lines of code, compiling, and running, will almost never end well. Finding a bug in a thousand lines of code is hard; finding the same bug in a single 20 line function is much easier. Unit tests will help narrow down the problem and catch bugs as they occur. Starting small and building iteratively will help catch mistakes sooner, reduce the scope of things that need to be checked when a bug occurs, and prevent you from wasting lots of effort going down a blind alley.\n\nLast, but not least, never measure your progress in lines of code. Some of the best programmers are the ones that think, read, and plan for an hour only to write a 5 line function that does exactly what they want. Writing lots of code quickly is rarely a good sign. The best code is well-understood, well-considered, and does what is intended in the simplest, cleanest way possible. Even then, almost nobody writes \"perfect\" code the first time. Your first attempt probably won't work. Your second attempt probably works, but it's poorly written. Maybe by the third time you'll have something half maintainable. Six months later, somebody else will point out a mistake you completely missed. Like a sculpture, good code starts with a rough idea and is hammered out and whittled down, taking a bit here and there, until every mark is perfect. And then somebody changes the requirements and you rip half of it up to start again.\n\nAll in all, don't be concerned about your speed. Good code takes time. Learn, understand, and perfect; don't rush.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, estimates!

The problem basically comes down to the fact that we don&amp;#39;t tend to think about what could go wrong. Instead, we visualize the best-case and maybe add some small fudge factor. The less experience we have, the less we realize how many things could go wrong and the worse we underestimate the time needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do to improve your estimates is to keep track of past endeavors. Record your estimate, what things happened that you didn&amp;#39;t expect, and how long it really took. Use that as a baseline when predicting future projects. Try to avoid thinking about what you &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; will happen and instead refer only to your recorded history. You can make small adjustments based on the current situation, if you want, but always use the historical record as the initial estimate and only adjust from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, know that programming is a skill and with experience comes expertise. Even with 10 years of practiced experience, I still find myself taking far longer than I expect when met with a new challenge. For example, I typically write Python code, but took on a side project last year that was more appropriate to do in C#. I spent weeks ahead of time reading up on the language, but every time I sat down to code, I would spend 80-90% of my time reading documentation to figure out the various classes, arguments, and other things that I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have memorized. The same thing happens to me when I use a new module or framework in Python. If I was just writing a simple Python script, I could write a screen full in minutes, but if there is anything I&amp;#39;m not familiar with (be it a module, class, etc.), it could be over an hour while I pour over the documentation. Likewise if a bug occurs that I don&amp;#39;t understand; it could be hours to debug it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the difference in ability between coders can vary a lot. Some past research has shown productivity to vary by a factor of up to 20x, even for people with similar experience in the same company. The difference between a freshman in college and an experienced, full-time programmer is likely much more than that. As you learn and gain experience, you will improve. Typing speed, memory, debugging skills; everything becomes easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As others have mentioned, one thing you can do to help yourself out is to test as you go. Writing a thousand lines of code, compiling, and running, will almost never end well. Finding a bug in a thousand lines of code is hard; finding the same bug in a single 20 line function is much easier. Unit tests will help narrow down the problem and catch bugs as they occur. Starting small and building iteratively will help catch mistakes sooner, reduce the scope of things that need to be checked when a bug occurs, and prevent you from wasting lots of effort going down a blind alley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, never measure your progress in lines of code. Some of the best programmers are the ones that think, read, and plan for an hour only to write a 5 line function that does exactly what they want. Writing lots of code quickly is rarely a good sign. The best code is well-understood, well-considered, and does what is intended in the simplest, cleanest way possible. Even then, almost nobody writes &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; code the first time. Your first attempt probably won&amp;#39;t work. Your second attempt probably works, but it&amp;#39;s poorly written. Maybe by the third time you&amp;#39;ll have something half maintainable. Six months later, somebody else will point out a mistake you completely missed. Like a sculpture, good code starts with a rough idea and is hammered out and whittled down, taking a bit here and there, until every mark is perfect. And then somebody changes the requirements and you rip half of it up to start again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, don&amp;#39;t be concerned about your speed. Good code takes time. Learn, understand, and perfect; don&amp;#39;t rush.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5jeu6s", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343264245.0, "created_utc": 1343260645.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_x5hkb", "children": [], "author": "chris-martin", "id": "c5jc8bv", "parent_id": "t3_x5hkb", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 9, "body": "On homework and class projects, my multiplier is 3... at work, it's more like 10.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On homework and class projects, my multiplier is 3... at work, it&amp;#39;s more like 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5jc8bv", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343254808.0, "created_utc": 1343251208.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 3, "link_id": "t3_x5hkb", "children": [], "author": "travelstacker", "id": "c5jcxqy", "parent_id": "t3_x5hkb", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 9, "body": "I decided years ago that all metrics are bunk for this, and asking the speed is bunk as well, when a colleague (genius guy) spent three months solving an issue we have with some drivers.

Generally the actual coding is not the determinant of time at all, thinking about what you're going to code up is. Also after all that, it's very hard to say that you've ever \"finished\" coding something. You can generally say you've added a feature on fixed a bug in some amount of time and are reasonably certain what you have works correctly, but there are always cases where a lot of unanticipated work will still need to be done - most estimates go off because of unanticipated work like this, not because of misestimating how long the actual typing will take.\n\nNowadays, I generally code 8-10 hours a day (because it's my job), but most of that isn't spent actually typing. Like today I wanted to add the processing of an extra type of object to an analysis tool I've worked on sporadically for the past few weeks (it's \"worked\" at all stages of this, the feature-set has just changed with time). Looking over what I needed to do to add support for the object, it became obvious that I'd have to duplicate a fair bit of functionality both in the main classes and in the tests for the classes. Even worse, the existing tests were putting a lot of effort into verifying behaviour that should have been abstracted out and tested once thoroughly instead of repeatedly and not as thoroughly for different variants of a common theme.\n\nNow, adding in support for the new object would have taken all of 20 minutes the lazy way - copy a couple of functions and tests, change some variables and arguments. The downside would be that that would make the already hard to manage classes even more convoluted, and the tests would be even farther from testing the general analysis and reporting logic thoroughly while also testing the different supported objects' functionality thoroughly. Now, is my time spent on this complete? Probably? I'm sure I'll have to change some of it eventually\n\nSo for the first couple of hours of the day I mostly sat there staring at the code, thinking through different organizations of things, how they'd affect the various usecases for the classes, and what seemed the best all round choice. By the time I'd decided on one, coding up the tests for it took all of 10 minutes, and making the code changes to satisfy the tests took maybe another half hour. Then to verify I hadn't broken anything I made the old tests work with the new code (even though they were effectively redundant now), and when satisfied that everything worked, deleted the old tests and all the unnecessary supporting methods that went with them.\n\nThen I added the new object I wanted to add, which took about 3 minutes, which should be how long it takes for any subsequent objects anyone wants to add to the system too.\n\nSo it took me about 3 hours to code in a new feature, even though it could have only taken me 20 minutes a different way. The gain is that now I'm much more confident that our tests are verifying correct behaviours for the classes they test, everything is far less coupled, the code is more readable, and future additions should only easier.\n\n&gt; follow up question, what slows you down while programming?

I get that too sometimes, but generally it's thinking on a design, or trying to figure WTF is going on with a weird bug that slows me down.\n\nWhat language are you working in? If it's something enterprisey like Java, C# or (to a lesser extent) C++, make sure you're using one of the good IDEs for the language, since a good IDE will take a lot of the boiler-plate typing out of the process for you, and (more importantly) along with that will take out a lot of potential for boneheaded mistakes that you might otherwise spend an hour or ten tracking down later. If it's not a language that has a well developed IDE, it's worth getting your VIM/Emacs fluency up, since there is still a lot of coding speed and reliability to be gained from using a powerful text editor well.", "edited": 1343262911.0, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the question hard to answer, since it&amp;#39;s not usually a timed, finite activity, or really one that we estimate times for. Generally the actual coding is not the determinant of time at all, thinking about what you&amp;#39;re going to code up is. Also after all that, it&amp;#39;s very hard to say that you&amp;#39;ve ever &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; coding something. You can generally say you&amp;#39;ve added a feature on fixed a bug in some amount of time and are reasonably certain what you have works correctly, but there are always cases where a lot of unanticipated work will still need to be done - most estimates go off because of unanticipated work like this, not because of misestimating how long the actual typing will take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I generally code 8-10 hours a day (because it&amp;#39;s my job), but most of that isn&amp;#39;t spent actually typing. Like today I wanted to add the processing of an extra type of object to an analysis tool I&amp;#39;ve worked on sporadically for the past few weeks (it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;worked&amp;quot; at all stages of this, the feature-set has just changed with time). Looking over what I needed to do to add support for the object, it became obvious that I&amp;#39;d have to duplicate a fair bit of functionality both in the main classes and in the tests for the classes. Even worse, the existing tests were putting a lot of effort into verifying behaviour that should have been abstracted out and tested once thoroughly instead of repeatedly and not as thoroughly for different variants of a common theme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, adding in support for the new object would have taken all of 20 minutes the lazy way - copy a couple of functions and tests, change some variables and arguments. The downside would be that that would make the already hard to manage classes even more convoluted, and the tests would be even farther from testing the general analysis and reporting logic thoroughly while also testing the different supported objects&amp;#39; functionality thoroughly. Now, is my time spent on this complete? Probably? I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll have to change some of it eventually&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for the first couple of hours of the day I mostly sat there staring at the code, thinking through different organizations of things, how they&amp;#39;d affect the various usecases for the classes, and what seemed the best all round choice.

No, this idea absolutely positively had to be tested right away, immediately, now.\n\nHarry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his bed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs, and started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he hadn't had time.)\n\nHarry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.\n\nThe other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the Great Hall and start the day.\n\n\"Excuse me can you do something for me?\" said Harry. He was flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the book at Anthony Goldstein. \"Pick two three-digit numbers from this list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to double-check?
