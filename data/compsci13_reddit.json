Having slightly different performance characteristics is probably pretty common, especially when you consider a single system, rather than a single board. (For the record, a big NUMA machine like an SGI Altix tends to just look like a n processor machine, even though it's potentially spread over several racks.) As such, all of the commercial Unices, BSD and Linux should be pretty happy - it's just a scheduling tweak after all - and there are machines out there that require it. Some of the issues are not dissimilar to hyperthreading can create fairly similar scenarios.\n\nWell, there's been machines that have had processors of differing types.\n\nAcorn's BBC Micro supported an extensive set of add on second processor boards. Application logic tended to move to the second processor, whilst the first processor (in the base machine) handled. The Acorn RiscPC (from 1994) had an ARM processor and a x86 processor (on swappable cards) which shared the same memory bus. This was intended for DOS/Windows in a window, but it was used for other purposes, not least floating point acceleration. There's also many, many machines that have been traditional processors + DSPs.\n\nQuite a few supercomputers used traditional microprocessors in concert with vector processors (and/or FPGAs).

My understanding is that for a prior in a situation like this, one simply uses &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; parameters for the distribution. Would I effectively use dummy parameters and sum the probabilities of each data point occurring for each point in the data set, and call that the prior? As near as I can tell, that would just give me some kind of constant, and I don&amp;#39;t think the prior is supposed to be a constant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this far, and if anything I&amp;#39;ve said is unclear, ask for clarification!

I'm a little confused with how to write the acceptance ratio, however. For reference, there are three parameters involved in this process, and the intensity function relies on t (more on that later)\n\nFirst off, I've read what appears to indicate that acceptance occurs if a random uniformly distributed number on [0,1) is larger than:\n\n(p(y\\*|x) / j(y\\*|y)) \n\n/\n\n(p(y|x) / j(y|y\\*)\n\nwhere p represents the probability of generating our data (x) using the posterior distribution given by y, and j represents the probability of getting to y\\* from y. In simple list form\n\n* p() = posterior distribution\n* j() = chance of going from t -&gt; t*\n* y = current parameters (current state of markov chain)\n* y\\* = proposed parameters (proposed next state of markov)\n* x = data point (I'm using a discrete set of data as opposed to a distribution)\n\nI have a hunch that I'm using the notations wrong, as this is one of the first times I've really dealt with Bayesian statistics\n\nNow, my understanding is that the posterior distribution is based on a prior distribution multiplied times a likelihood function, L.\n\nSo, the formula I'm working with has the probability of an event happening at time t depending partly on the summation of t&lt;ti of (t-ti) (the summation of all t-tis for all tis smaller than t) where tis are the times of events that have happened prior to t.\n\nI'm really confused with how to generate the prior distribution. My understanding is that for a prior in a situation like this, one simply uses \"dummy\" parameters for the distribution. Would I effectively use dummy parameters and sum the probabilities of each data point occurring for each point in the data set, and call that the prior? As near as I can tell, that would just give me some kind of constant, and I don't think the prior is supposed to be a constant.\n\nThanks for reading this far, and if anything I've said is unclear, ask for clarification!

My advice is: find real problems that real people are facing. The simplex method was invented because, well, they had a huge set of linear constraints and needed to solve them. Same with cutting board problem, and string matching, and public-key cryptography, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important choice you can make as a researcher is what problems you choose to work on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One common problem with academia has is that we sometimes solve problems that people don&amp;#39;t really have. For theory, though, this is a little bit less of a problem since sometimes results aggregate over decades before someone finds a use for them (e.g. see Number Theory and cryptography).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c4z8otb", "flair_text": null, "created": 1339451655.0, "created_utc": 1339448055.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_uvvfi", "children": [], "author": "Kambingx", "id": "c4zleja", "parent_id": "t3_uvvfi", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "In addition to the excellent advice about reading, reading, reading, make sure you also get involved with the research scene in your university.

Each state would have a position within your overall window.  You can loop over each state and test the point to see if it is within the boundaries of the current state.
