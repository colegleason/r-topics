How much of a joke is our IT?</title><url>http://i.imgur.com/wEGB2.gif</url><snippet>  Our networking can't possibly be down when the strain on them is at the highest point in the semester!  You can't explain that! I also work for Engrit IT along side nameless912 and Cooluke. Here's what I have to say about anything and everything:

* 95% of the issues that piss people off are out of the control of us student workers (help desk &amp;amp; lab sitter stations). All we can really do is notify the higher up staff who is already spread extremely thin. They try their hardest to do everything they do, but most of the IT Pros really do have a lot on their plate.

* Part of what has happened recently is we are moving to "unified services". In the past every department (ECE, MechSE, CS, Aero, etc) had their own IT services. Some like TSG for CS was very good at it, specialized in CS needs, while other IT departments were horrible. Now it all resides under Engineering IT, which is a double edged sword. While each department still has their own IT Crowd, some of that specialized knowledge was lost in the transition, and we're experiencing the growing pains of coming together as one.

* As student workers, we are trained on the printers, extremely basic hardware support, and basic things with account log ins. Really it's not much. We are the lowest Tier of support, but unfortunately every single request comes through us first. Our primary job at the help desk actually isn't to answer questions, but to route questions to the correct support group. Once we do that, we never look at it again. All these things with network slowness is totally out of our control. 

* To the comment about not enough computers, we actually have a ton of departmental labs with a ton of computers that just don't get utilized by people of those departments, and instead they use the general EWS labs. There's two huge computer labs in Transportation building with ~50 machines, Ceramics building, Loomis, Talbot. While most of those labs are supposed to be for certain departments, I know that usually the doors to these labs are unlocked. Need a computer? To to Talbot 321D, I've never seen it full. Same with Loomis 257. We don't advertise these labs to everyone since they are departmental labs, but as long as you can get into the lab, you'll be able to log in (if you have an EWS account).

* Finally I can say that we do have a lot of lazy staff. People go into working for EWS thinking they can do nothing, and get paid to do homework. While I'm not denying that yes, you can get homework done at word, if you're doing your job well, it's really quite difficult to. Lab sitters often don't bother to troubleshoot anything, get supplies, or anything else because "someone is coming in after me, they can do it" or "the guys at the help desk will fix this".

TLDR: Don't blame the student workers, except the lazy ones

Edit: fixed "coolukes" name cause he's whiny :P I know plenty of people upset about this, and nobody blames the student workers.  Hell, I personally blame the administration more than anything else because clearly at some stage funds are being misallocated.  All the EWS people I've dealt with have been fairly friendly given the circumstances. I also work for Engrit IT along side nameless912 and Cooluke.

Edit: fixed "coolukes" name cause he's whiny :P    I mean we are all studying for finals and we don't have any projects or mps to complete. Right guys? I mean we are all studying for finals and we don't have any projects or mps to complete. Right guys? But let's be honest. There are 6000 students logged in at any one moment over the rest of this week and next. You might have anticipated that? Just saying. I did, but so should EWS. How could we have made it better? Just saying. I agree with your point of view that money should be better spent on preparing for such incidents. I just hate when people keep saying shit like "oh you should have started earlier" and blah blah blah implying it's absolutely our fault. I guess there's nothing which will be done about it in the near future...  I mean we are all studying for finals and we don't have any projects or mps to complete. Right guys? [deleted] Sorry, I meant that comment to be sarcastic. I am in 290 as well and I can understand the frustration..  As someone who works engineering IT, fuck you. The Engineering department way underfunds us, and our servers can't handle 6000 students all trying to log in at once. I'm sorry we're not running a Google Data Center, could you please back off? Hey,
You or someone familiar with the details of how it all works, should do an AMA on the infrastructure, issues, etc behind EWS. I mean, I know the basics of how it all works. haha But I've only been on the EWS team for about 3 months. I can ask one of my redditing coworkers if they'll do it! Are you a full timer? I don't know of any full time people who reddit.  No, I'm an hourly student worker. But I poke around a lot. haha Yea same. I worked here over the summer and still don't know how it all works, because unlike what most people think, its pretty complicated.  As someone who works engineering IT, fuck you. The Engineering department way underfunds us, and our servers can't handle 6000 students all trying to log in at once. I'm sorry we're not running a Google Data Center, could you please back off? Why not?   Everyone else deploys to amazon AWS which can scale to add as  much demand as your dept would ever need. 

Plus it is easy and cheap. You could probably even supplement your own servers with EC2 AWS instances in a way that no one would know the difference.  Why not?   Everyone else deploys to amazon AWS which can scale to add as  much demand as your dept would ever need. 

Plus it is easy and cheap. You could probably even supplement your own servers with EC2 AWS instances in a way that no one would know the difference.  Who exactly is "everyone else"? I've never heard of a college using AWS for IT services, and top of that, as kbotc points out so eloquently below, Amazon doesn't really give two shits about its users' privacy. Hence, we can't use it by federal law. By 'everyone else' I'm referring to a significant margin of modern IT, not necessarily university IT departments. 

[However university IT departments are using AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/education/)

AWS has become really popular because of the ease at which you can deploy services and instances, scaling is super easy, and relatively inexpensive.  It allows really small teams to do the work of a much larger IT department.

The university nearly completely outsourced mail services to google and microsoft so cloud services aren't without question at the university level, and there is certainly a pathway to FERPA compliance.

I've never heard of a college using AWS for IT services, and top of that, as kbotc points out so eloquently below, Amazon doesn't really give two shits about its users' privacy. Hence, we can't use it by federal law. Microsoft Azure will sign a FERPA/HIPPAA BAA. Costs about $5 a month per server.  They just offered it to U of I, just need your admins to get working on it! As someone who works engineering IT, fuck you. The Engineering department way underfunds us, and our servers can't handle 6000 students all trying to log in at once. I'm sorry we're not running a Google Data Center, could you please back off? Fuck no.

I know how much is getting paid into this system.  If it's politics that's stopping us from having reliable servers, then you guys should be making more noise than anybody.

I would have sympathy for you, I really would.  But there are **hotels and coffee shops** that have 24/7 IT on-call and EWS doesn't?  Why is it that there's no *phone number* that I can call to reach you guys?  Why is it that it takes two days for email responses to ews@illinois.edu to go through?  Y'all are being paid for this for god's sake... how do you expect reliable outage intelligence and response when there is literally no client feedback involved? 

Trust me, I know it sucks working IT for a lot of users and being underpaid for it.  I've been there.  But goddamn it, we're paying enough to expect a functional network.  My frustrations aren't directed at you in particular, they're directed at whoever's fault that is.  I'm sure you know better than I.

But I know there are professors who pay thousands for managed instances, and I've seen that "management" at work.  Hours if not days to respond to e-mails, incompetent solutions, etc.  In the private sector, $1k a month will buy you some beef in a tier 1 datacenter, fully managed with e-mail response guaranteed within minutes, 99.99% uptime or your money back, and full support for flexible backups/restores as well as OS installation and software troubleshooting.

Against pretty much all modern benchmarks, EWS and ENGRIT are jokes.  You literally have no idea what you're talking about. You can kindly go fuck yourself, because nothing you've said has been constructive or helpful, just whining like a little bitch. 

Edit: To attempt to answer your legitimate complaints, but just expecting you to be a dick about it: 

1) By "Hotels and coffee shops" I'm sure you mean multimillion dollar, nation wide companies. Pretty sure it makes sense for them to have something like that, not an extremely local and as nameless912 said, underfunded program like ours. Dude, wake up. 

2) Every time you send an email to ews@illinois.edu it gets sent to a queue. That queue is monitored by all the Helpdesk workers (ie students), a some of the full time staff. That means that if you send an email to us over the weekend, its not going to get answered unless one of us feels like answering easy tickets while on other duties, or the guy working at Siebel for 3 hours on Saturday and Sunday answers it. 

3) Everything else you said is just bullshit. If you think you know this much about how it should work, maybe you should come talk to the head of the department. I'm sure you can figure out who that is. 

4) By "paying enough for it", do you really think you can quantify that? You have no idea how much of your tuition comes to us, and as I've sort of figured out along the way, its not much.  Wow, *you're* telling *me* to calm down?  All I said is that our IT is a joke, and should be better for the amount of money we pay in.  I think you'll find it's not an unpopular opinion, and I only started taking an aggressive tone about it after this random guy who works at EWS responded to my headline by telling me to go fuck myself.

I knew egos were bad in Engineering, but god damn, take some criticism.

I know how the system works, and I'm just saying that in literally any serious IT for any organization ever with more than 50 concurrent users has 24/7 support.  My entire family works in IT, and I've spent several years doing the same bullshit.  It's pretty much a minimum requirement for any serious service... when you have 6,000 users, "wait until tomorrow at 9AM when business hour start" is simply not an acceptable response to an outage.

Against pretty much all modern benchmarks, EWS and ENGRIT are jokes.  Functional network? I'd be willing to be donuts to dollars that the network was fine. My personal guess? The storage became overloaded and you couldn't get your NIS data, ergo, no log in. $1k would get you enough server space for about 1 concurrent engineering student per month. I'm going to guess you've never had to support a lab environment where your servers are getting hit by several thousand concurrent users who want to run compilers and modeling software. This is not exactly an easy task, no matter what you say.

Response is difficult due to privacy concerns. We can't outsource it, so we have to have the same folks who are trying to fix the problem responding to end users while professors are breathing down their neck. Not a pleasant situation for anyone. They're probably reading the email and not responding while they're working on the issue at hand. &amp;gt;$1k would get you enough server space for about 1 concurrent engineering student per month.

I think you could get *at least* 3 concurrent users, even of complex modelling/rendering software, on a properly designed $1k component of a larger cluster. I'd say you're likely very wrong. IO waits are going to kill you. They always do. Shared hosting is usually very terrible for that in particular. Fuck no.

Against pretty much all modern benchmarks, EWS and ENGRIT are jokes.  EWS is a joke, because there is so much political bullshit going on between EWS and the College of Engineering. You're right, the amount we pay compared to the service we get absolutely BLOWS. But it's not our faults, it's the college of engineering being stupid with our money. And there is a phone number you can call, it's just not advertised well enough in the labs (217-333-1313). And for the record, the only reason it takes a few days for an email to be responded to is because we get literally hundreds of tickets a day, and have maybe 30 people that are working on the ticket system throughout the course of a day, usually no more than 10 at once.

Also, how do you expect 24/7 IT on call? We're mostly student employee run, our full timers have lives that they want to spend out of the office occasionally. And, without the support from the college of engineering we need, how can you expect 24/7 uptime and a 24 hour staff that can respond to server outages quickly? Or even servers with the capacity to support 6,000 login instances at once?

Engineering IT and EWS are 3 years old. They have little departmental funding compared with what they need. They don't have many full time staffers. I'm sorry we're not the best tech department on the face of the Earth but Goddammit we're trying.

tl;dr I'm sorry that you can't wait til 8 AM the next morning when your porn doesn't load on university computers. I'm not blaming you, I'm just venting.  Your inability to take what is, in my opinion, legitimate criticism speaks volumes towards the inability to tame such a large network of the current EWS staff.

I've worked in 4 person IT shops.  4 people running ~50 boxes.  We had someone on call 24/7 and we each made about $1,000 a month.  In the private sector, this shit costs peanuts.

The first time I e-mailed, I even detailed exactly what was wrong (some issue with degradation of the disk synchronization you guys have between machines).  The response I receieved was 2 days late and not even legitimate.

Also, let's stay away from personal attacks?  I'm not watching porn on EWS, I'm using the autograding scripts our CS classes require, scripts not provided at all outside of EWS.  If I had another choice, I'd take it, but I have work to do and the way it stands I need EWS.  You directly insulted the department, saying that we obviously don't have any idea what we're doing, and that we're all useless. Well, that hurt. Hence why I had to point out all the stupidity you just spouted. Also, ~50 boxes run by 4 people is nothing compared to 1500+ boxes (counting faculty machines, lab machines, and everything in between) as well as a massive, aging server infrastructure run by maybe 20 full time staff and 60 student workers, most of whom provide L1 support, if that. You're expecting us to operate like a department with 5x the funding we have.

Edit: large network of staff, my ass. Twenty full-timers on 1500 boxes is not a bad ratio.  I never said you guys were all useless, because if you were, I wouldn't be complaining about the downtime of the service in the first place.  All I'm saying is that EWS needs better support and outage response.  The headline image was not intended to offend, it was intended to make people laugh after being frustrated that they were losing hours during finals week.  Judging from the response it got in private forums other than /r/UIUC, it was pretty effective in doing so... I'm really sorry people here seem to take it so personally and mean you no offense. Twenty full timers to 1500 boxes is 75 computers PER PERSON, assuming every person in ENGRIT works directly with user support (which is not the case-we have 2 guys that serve as our Windows and Linux admins, as well as 3 or 4 people that handle infrastructure specifically). Now, this might still not be a problem if not for the fact that, no offense, but many (I don't want to say most, but most) of our users are absolutely useless with computers, and that goes for a lot of the profs as well. We need at least double the staff we have now, and triple would be even better to fully manage our entire network. In institutional IT, 75 boxes per person is not an unmanageable load.  I think the problem comes when many of the people working for EWS are consumed by low-level end-user support, increasing the number of boxes/sysadmin.  How does EWS handle "I restarted my computer and can't figure out how to get into Linux" type requests differently from a "it seems your distributed filesystem is crashing and burning, here are some access logs and a timestamp" support requests?  And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Go to [this page](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/) and check the stuff on the right. It tells you how many computers are being used in what labs. I know about that page, but I don't think it updates frequently enough, because at MEL, Grainger, Eng. Hall and DCL there were literally zero computers open when I got there that day. Still, EWS needs more computers regardless And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Depending on what you need, you might be able to remote in. Check out your options [here](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections). I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha Just making sure. It's crazy how many people don't know their options.  Remote desktop is really convenient if you need to get something off your EWS drive or something like that , but I wish it was fast enough to do the heavy stuff. And if it had MS Office that would be useful. It's still nice that they offer it though I agree that sometimes it isn't the fastest, but it seems that NX client is good enough for most of my linux needs. As for the Windows machines, I think they have MS Office. Linux doesn't have it for obvious reasons.  MS Office isn't offered on Citrix mainly because its too expensive, but every windows lab has it, yes.  MS Office isn't offered on Citrix mainly because its too expensive, but every windows lab has it, yes.  Yes it is....? I just logged in and I could use it no problem. ESCs have access to MS Office, everyone else doesn't. I thought my roommate was crazy until he showed me he didn't have it. Then someone from windows admin told me they can't offer it to everyone because of the cost of licensing.  I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha Revit and Inventor are both available over Citrix. Because of the way citrix works, its actually quite fast. All the computations are actually done server side, and it just sends you a graphical interface. This means its just as fast as actually using one of the computers in the labs. 

Edit: To be clear, this is not how NX works, and why its generally slower than using the computers in the labs.  I know all about remote desktop/citrix but what I needed was autodesk software like Revit and Inventor. No way am I going to remote in for that haha You can get most autodesk software on your computer with their student edition software. That's where I got Inventor on my laptop.  You have to register yourself first.

WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  The worst is when people log in, lock the screen, then walk away to study elsewhere for an hour or two.  There were about 4 or 5 computers in that state in Grainger the other day. For future instances in which you see a computer like this, if the user has taken with them all of their stuff, leaving only the computer locked, feel free to take their spot. You can force a logout by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace on Linux workstations, or simply doing a hard reset on Windows machines. That's just it, they leave a single notebook or waterbottle.  Otherwise yes, I would have no qualms about logging them out.  They kept coming back every half hour or so. And the fact that the amount of EWS computers available in general is silly. this weekend I spent 30 minutes walking around trying to find an open spot to work. WE NEED MORE LABS EWS!  Most people are trending to reducing the amount of labs due to the birth of the mobile generation, UIUC might be doing the same, you should find out!

Source: I manage all the public computing labs here at UIC and they want to reduce/cut our lab population (I run about 1800 machines). That's interesting. I would agree that for general computing labs that is a reasonable strategy, but for engineering workstations, which most people use (or should use) for heavy duty applications I would think the demand would not decrease due to mobile devices.

Thanks for the insight though, I would imagine the biggest constraint on capacity is cost  Is it just the Linux systems that are down? I sat in 057 Grainger for an hour before giving up. But then I went to the linux lab on the second floor of Everitt and it was working fine, but I want two monitors!!!!!!!!!!!  Is it just the Linux systems that are down? I sat in 057 Grainger for an hour before giving up. But then I went to the linux lab on the second floor of Everitt and it was working fine, but I want two monitors!!!!!!!!!!!  Given the symptoms that I observed (inability to log in and general lagginess), I'm guessing it was both Windows and Linux. There was a brief outage Sunday with similar symptoms that affected both Windows and Linux labs. I've been using one of the windows systems for a few hours and it seems to be working fine. Yeah, I was in 057 on Sunday and it was very frustrating. I emailed ews to ask why this happens and say it's really inconvenient. They said, "The infrastructure team is aware of the server issues, and has been working on making it more reliable all semester." Hey, that was me! And they are! Sucks they still have problems, but honestly, it seems to be better than the last couple semesters.   It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Isn't Matlab free on the WebStore? Just download your own. Or is that subject to the same pool of licences?  It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Some of the Math and LAS labs have Matlab, right?

EDIT: I just asked, G8B in FLB has Matlab. I think you have to have the software installed on a computer, but you also need a [license key](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/faculty_center/licensing.html) to use it, and the university has only a finite amount of these license keys. Many people are simultaneously using Matlab at this time, so it is difficult to get a license key and use it. You have to wait until someone closes their application and releases a license key.  It's also hard to use Matlab at this time of the semester. It says all licenses have been checked out and are in use. Use GNU Octave? https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ No, I haven't, I've heard Octave is like Matlab but free - is that true? Is it as user-friendly (to install and to use) as Matlab? I'll be honest, I've never had a reason to use either. But one of the goals of the Octave project is to replicate MATLAB's functionality and make it easy for people to migrate, and from my understanding the differences are minimal. There are some small differences in syntax, but that's all I know off the top of my head. 

If you're using Windows, here's a link to an installer:http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Windows#Octave-3.6.1-mingw_.2B_octaveforge_pkgs

If you're using Linux, it should be in your distros repos. So yum install octave, apt-get install octave, pacman -S octave, etc etc.  Thanks, I would have to install it in Linux. Do you know if it has the full functionality of Matlab, for example, does it have the different toolboxes?   Anddddd netfiles down for maintenance 3:30 till 9am. NPRE 402 exam at 8am. Guess I can't wing it by reading up lecture notes the night before. Just gonna wing it. Why are you still using Netfiles? It's gone in 9 days. Anddddd netfiles down for maintenance 3:30 till 9am.

This is a serious comment. Anyone who needs their tech elective GPA up needs to take this class.

Guess I can't wing it by reading up lecture notes the night before. Just gonna wing it.  EWS/TSG is a joke. A lot of the CS faculty hate them too. TSG doesn't exist anymore, its all under Engineering IT now. There definitely seems to be an interesting relationship between the CS professors and IT, but I think its more complicated than you're making it out to be.  CS faculty hate EWS because CS wants its own IT department. And I mean, they have their own L2 support separate from EWS that has access to the ticket queue and whatnot because they've bitched about it enough. But it's really just CS faculty being whiny and wanting special treatment. </snippet></document><document><title>I lost my awesome mechanical pencil in DCL's linux labs.

Thanks again everyone. what kind is it Kuru Toga Roulette That's a $20 pencil....  Is it worth it? How is it compared to a bic? What happens when you run out of eraser? How is the quality of the eraser? What size lead? 8)  I love my mechanical bic pencil, but this looks like a sharp pencil. Before this pencil I usually used pens or mediocre pencils like Papermate Sharpwriters.  If you're talking about those cheap plastic Bics that you can buy like 10 of for $5, I absolutely hate those.

I bought this thing in March and I have not used a pen or any other pencil since.  Literally the only time I use a pen is when I have to (a signature or a check).

The pencil ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Kuru-Toga-Roulette-Model-Auto-Lead-Rotation-Mechanical-Pencil-0.5-mm-Gun-Metallic-Body/pd/6547)) uses 0.5mm lead.  There's a cheaper, all plastic version of the pencil called the Kuru Toga for about half the price.  The Roulette is the metal version.  I bought three packs of the recommended Uni-ball NanoDiamond lead from JetPens ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-NanoDia-Low-Wear-Pencil-Lead-0.5-mm-HB/pd/3742)), and the claims that they make are true.  I press hard when I write and this pencil's lead has broken less than a dozen times in the last *8 months*.  The eraser is small, but I just ended up ordering a high polymer eraser which I carry around with the pencil ([here](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Boxy-Eraser-Black/pd/499)).

As for sharpness, I will repaste what I wrote in reply to a different comment:

&amp;gt;But the really unique feature of this pencil is the fact that every time you press down and then lift the pencil up again (such as in between letters), the pencil will rotate the lead about 15 degrees. It will constantly rotate the lead, making it stay perfectly sharp.  I'm sure you've written with a mechanical pencil before. You probably rotate the pencil in your hand every minute or so so avoid the flat side that forms after writing. The Kuru Toga gets rid of that problem and your lines are perfectly uniform without the need for you to rotate the pencil in your hand.

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSgh6SJuWTs)

Buying this thing, in hindsight, was a very good decision. Wow, thanks for that awesome reply! If you're calling those bics cheap, I feel like I am missing out! I will definitely be ordering one of these ASAP!! 

Actually, let me know if you order on from that website... Free shipping on orders over $25 The first time I ordered I got the pencil, 3 packs of that lead (should last you years), and that eraser, which was just over $25.

Keep in mind that shipping can take up to 7 business days... in case you are going home for break early next week.

Buying this thing, in hindsight, was a very good decision.  You mean... [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/Bcnvy.jpg) mechanical pencil?  Did you check with the lab sitter there? All the EWS labs have a lost and found so just ask the lab sitter. Granted things like pencils don't usually get turned in....  See I posted something like this 2 months ago about a jacket I left at Grainger and I got ridiculed while everyone said there was no way I'd get it back.

The course is really made by the professor, so I think the class is definitely doable for a non-music major with any of the other instructors!  (I had Gordon this semester for reference.) Ah, it definitely seems like the type of class that would vary a lot by professor. Every professor does the course on specifically the cultures that they have done research on. In theory this is a good way to teach because the professors are passionate about the material but it ends up being a tad bit boring when you're learning about bulgarian folk music for 2 months straight.

Not to mention that when I took it the material was not friendly towards non-musicians. There was a listening section of the final exam where we had to name the "time" of the music.

It says on transfer admission that the GPA requirement is a 2.7, so if I have above that will I for sure get in, or is it very competitive?      I got into LAS with a 2.8-ish from a community college. You should be fine.  Congrats &#3232;_&#3232;      Transferred to physics from community college in IL.  It's mostly based on meeting the specific class requirements they lay out on the website.  I didn't have (and still don't, whelp) rhet 105 credit, but my GPA made up for it. What was your GPA?  Fairly easy to get here, fairly easy to fail out by never getting your life together once you get here.

Transfer students are always in such a precarious situation... What do you mean?  Freshmen can have a semester, or really even a whole year, of screwing up -- and still make it out of here with a degree.

If a transfer student shows up in a major and fails to make progress in their first semester, they are in serious trouble. The fact that their geneds are done does not help them complete a major -- if anything, it hinders their chances since they are stuck taking all upper-level major courses all at once.

Maybe it's different in a major like Global Studies, but in technical majors this is a serious danger.  </snippet></document><document><title>vet care at the VetMed Hosital?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14p1v1/vet_care_at_the_vetmed_hosital/</url><snippet>What kind of experiences have you had with the UIUC student vet hospital?

  Try www.placeofmine.com this was founded by one of the CS professor  Do you need a house, or will an apartment do? Also, try going to the Tenant Union with your criteria list to see what they suggest. if it's a really nice apartment that isn't in a big complex that will do. as long as it has a reputable landlord ie. not cpm.  finding a house that is just 2 bedroom's is the problem.

I'm starting to believe in this team being for real.   
[Joey B fakeout](http://i.imgflip.com/9a2e.gif)
  Top 10. Who would have thunk it?!  We were predicted preseason by many to come in 9th or worse in the Big Ten... I don't think we were ever predicted to finish 9th or worse. Source? I don't think we were ever predicted to finish 9th or worse. Source?   Now hear me out on this. I LOVE GROCE, but when Weber came into town, didn't the exact same thing happen? Illini go nuts and we get into the Championship game?

Weber lost his guys at the end, but just how bad was he really now?
Either way, GO ILLINI! Wasn't Weber's team Self's recruiting class, though? It was, but Groce's team is Weber's class. It this really a product of Coach Groce, or just the change of scenery that the players enjoy. Just something I thought of. Self's players that Weber inherited lost to Duke in the third round in a close game. That was after the team struggled so badly in its first several games that Weber had a "funeral" for Self. The year before that, Self had done pretty well with them, only one starter graduated.

The players that Groce inherited fit much the same mold as what Weber inherited - weak inside play with 3-guard offense being most effective. However, Weber had a hard time motivating his players and definitely had a style that was painful to watch in a loss.

This team will lose games, and it will probably have at least one bad loss. However, they are definitely showing that they are fun to watch. Just enjoy the fun. It's dumb to give Self credit for Weber's success as it is dumb to give Weber credit for Groce's success. Both teams changed immensely with the change in staff, losing the centers to the NBA. Deron Williams went from completely forgettable  to one of the best players in the country. BP went from wildly inconsistent to Wooden contender.



Oh yeah, and broken jaws. Happened to both bp and Williams. Self's players that Weber inherited lost to Duke in the third round in a close game.

You get a 25c raise every semester, and a dollar raise if you apply to be a supervisor.

Can pretty easily drop hours/pick up hours if you're having a heavy or light week in school.

The main thing that I enjoy about it is my coworkers though. Everyone is really awesome and fun to work with.

Don't need to apply, just email the head of the dining halls and you just go in and see if they have shifts that fit your schedule still open. Very easy. university catering is where it's at  Campus Rec. Pretty flexible.  Yes, but OP said next semester and I believe the hiring process is complete already for next semester. It is not.

I'm trying to take courses that would expose me to personal finance or investment, but other topics would be great as well.

Next semester, I'm thinking about taking FIN 221 (Corporate Finance), ACCY 200 (Fundamentals of Accounting), or BADM 310 (Management and Organizational Behavior).  I've also heard SHS 120 (Child, Comm and Lang Ability) and GE 361 (Emotional Intelligent Skills) are good classes as well.  Can anyone attest to the usefulness of those courses? 
  I thought NPRE 101 with Ruzic seemed a lot more useful than the esoteric engineering classes I have taken. You learn about both the technical and political aspects of energy issues that are pretty important. 

Ruzic also kinda just teaches what he thinks is important to know for getting through life without being taken advantage of. A lot of the time it felt like it was your dad teaching you fatherly things like how a car engine works and what type of oil you will need or how to insulate your house well.

Also, it is incredibly easy and there's lots and lots of explosions.

Oh yeah, you learn how to make moonshine too.  vegetable gardening vegetable gardening  Physics 140: How Things Work DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS When I took it 4 years ago it was great.

It is a huge competitive advantage over other job candidates if you can do programming. It can make you irreplaceable, depending on your job. And it makes you very qualified to talk to the CS people that will fuel large portions of the future economy.

Also, after getting through all the MPs you sort of feel like a wizard. Really...

EVERY scientific computing internship I applied for, they always chose the science major over the CS one, and from what I can tell from talking to people, a lot of science majors don't take data structures.

Not sure how much ACCY will help you personally, unless your're a business major. Try a personal finance course.  Why is FIN221 useless? 

Any recommendations for a personal finance course? The only class I can find is FIN435 (Personal Wealth Management) which isn't available this spring.

This game truly puts us on the map as a serious contender, not just an overrated team with the benefit of a weak schedule.

I can't say I went into tonight thinking we'd pull it out. Four years of attending this school and watching this team have me feeling guarded all the way to the big ten tournament. Especially after beating Gardner-Webb State by 2 points just two weeks ago   I want to believe   We need to keep playing at this level to stay competitive in the B1G. We were successful against a good Gonzaga team because we were able to hit threes consistently AND drive to the basket, and keeping this balance will be so important against teams like Indiana and Michigan. 

That being said, I am beyond excited for the rest of the season. We proved that we're a force to be reckoned with after all this mumbo jumbo about being overrated.

maybe post on facebook or check craigslist in a few days to see if anyone is trying to sell your phone.</snippet></document><document><title>Do Apartment prices drop in the spring semester?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14l6on/do_apartment_prices_drop_in_the_spring_semester/</url><snippet>I've noticed one tenet drop his price a little bit, i was wondering if anyone has any stories of signing in the spring and getting a really good deal out of it  yeah but mostly on subleases I think due to people dropping out of leases. same reason summer here is dirt cheap I don't mean for just the spring semester i'm asking about signing a apartment for next year in the fall    Two years ago I waited to sign until mid-late april.

It says at http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/lab-software/ews-linux-lab-software that the EWS Linux workstations already have it. It says you can load it manually via

    module load cuda-toolkit    

Edit: I tried it via ssh and then ran 'which nvcc' which gave me

    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which nvcc
    /software/cuda-toolkit-4.1-x86_64/cuda/bin/nvcc

They have all the tools available: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads I don't have one in my laptop :( that's why I was asking.    I tried getting CUDA to work on my desktop... it ended with me reinstalling my OS. Probably because I was doing it wrong.</snippet></document><document><title>How competitive is it to get into CEE?</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14k8vi/how_competitive_is_it_to_get_into_cee/</url><snippet>I'm an LAS student and would like to ask all the UIUC redditors that have transferred into CEE.

PS: I was in the college of engineering before (don't ask me why, long story), will this affect my chances?  If your grades are good, you shouldn't have a problem. Either way, I'd go in and talk with them, and if your grades aren't good, you guys can set up a plan for you to prove that you'll fair well (for example, you take the intro class and get an A)

Either way, go in and talk with the CEE dept ASAP, so you can start working towards transferring (it may take a few sems) 3.7 enough? </snippet></document><document><title>By far my favorite comment in the Illini-Gonzaga game thread in r/collegebasketball</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/14j33t/game_thread_illinois_at_gonzaga/c7djpbj</url><snippet /></document><document><title>Math 415</title><url>http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/14kk5c/math_415/</url><snippet>Is anyone thinking about dropping Math 415 on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I need to pick that up really badly  hmm, yeah. just hold tight. word of wisdom though...don't take this course with haboush. horrible professor.  You too? Sigh, the tests were all on material AFTER the last homework. I don't even. two and a half years out of UIUC, and that class still leaves a bad taste. not sure how he's still teaching--he's done some pretty important things in math if I'm not mistaken. two and a half years out of UIUC, and that class still leaves a bad taste. not sure how he's still teaching--he's done some pretty important things in math if I'm not mistaken.

I was looking at a bunch of places within University Group and I was wondering if anyone had any issues with them.  I was looking through old posts and no one said anything good or bad.  I will probably head over to the Tenant Union once things start getting serious, but before I fall in love with a place through them I just want to make sure that they shouldn't be avoided like CPM.     Living with them was fine, just don't expect all of your security deposit back. It's kind of a trade off for paying lower rent. They automatically deduct a bunch for carpet shampooing (and it says so in your lease), but what pissed me off most was that they charged us for repainting when the walls in my unit were clearly fine. It was just something they wanted to do to the whole building even though not every unit needed it. They also charged something over $100 for a cleaning service even though my friends and I spent a whole day cleaning the shit out of the place at the end of the lease.

But during the lease, when we needed stuff done they were pretty good. I just re-signed with them for next year, in fact. how much was the security deposit, if you don't mind me asking how much was the security deposit, if you don't mind me asking</snippet></document><document><title>Last year we had the goggles, now we have... air guitar?</title><url>http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1851131/airguitarbro.gif</url><snippet> </snippet></document></searchresult>
