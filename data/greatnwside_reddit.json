The ordinance originally proposed by the administration included provisions to allow\u00a0anonymous ethics complaints against aldermen.

I will continue to support any changes that help\u00a0strengthen ethics and restore trust in city government.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same city council meeting, I introduced a resolution calling for hearings into the site selection process for red light cameras. 23 other aldermen signed onto the resolution.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original intent of the cameras was to improve traffic safety, and I support that goal. However, recent allegations of unethical behavior by the program vendor make me concerned that camera sites were selected based on how much revenue they would generate, not how much safer that would make our roads.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The resolution asks that Chicago Department of Transportation officials be prepared to discuss how sites are selected,\u00a0who takes part in making those decisions, and\u00a0what data is examined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we&amp;#39;ll get some answer so that we can ensure that this tool makes our roads safer and isn&amp;#39;t used simply to generate revenue.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks\nI want to thank\u00a0the students from Schurz High School who took time out of their day off school Tuesday to show almost 200 seniors a good time during my Senior Valentine&amp;#39;s Dance.

You can find a recap of the meeting here.\n\nAccording to police statistics, crime is down nine percent in the heart of Portage Park this year, compared to last year. Arrests are up 130 percent, and police contacts with people are up 49 percent.\u00a0\n\nIn response to the shootings, four or five more squad cars have been\u00a0assigned\u00a0to the 16th District, according to police. But police can't do it alone. Most of all, police need us to remain vigilant. If you see something suspicious, call 911.\n", "saved": false, "id": "18a9i2", "clicked": false, "title": "45th Ward Alderman Arena Email Update - Sunday February 10th 2013", "num_comments": 0, "comments": [], "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "banned_by": null, "upvotes": 5, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "modhash": "xn67xhhqsgc2ef22ed50794e6bbbae5cd00ca4713fea710d46", "media_embed": {}, "more_comments": "", "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/greatNWside/comments/18a9i2/45th_ward_alderman_arena_email_update_sunday/", "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t3_18a9i2", "created": 1360579904.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/greatNWside/comments/18a9i2/45th_ward_alderman_arena_email_update_sunday/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "DjangoKilla", "created_utc": 1360551104.0, "link_flair_text": null, "media": null, "num_reports": null}, "59": {"domain": "flickr.com", "link_flair_class": null, "author_flair_class": null, "downvotes": 1, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w9yy", "subreddit": "greatNWside", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "saved": false, "id": "18qouu", "clicked": false, "title": "Lawrence &amp; Sawyer ", "num_comments": 3, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2w9yy", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qouu", "id": "c8h6lcw", "author": "xrawv", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_18qouu", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "For a second there I thought it was  1960.", "edited": false, "modhash": "", "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a second there I thought it was  1960.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "greatNWside", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c8h6lcw", "flair_text": "Dickinson Park", "created": 1361198017.0, "created_utc": 1361194417.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w9yy", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qouu", "id": "c8h86z2", "author": "DebRsBungalow", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_18qouu", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "Wow, fantastic pictures, Bitchfork.
