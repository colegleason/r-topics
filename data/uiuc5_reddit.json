There are committees that actually manage this. I was on one myself.\n\n-Serving as the sounding board of the student body. You get a diverse array of opinions in 40,000 students, and while individual groups can push for action on an issue, we serve as a way to pare down all those different opinions into one that is easily digestible by the administration. Dear God, you should have seen the debates that occurred about the administration's actions taken during the Next Dance.\n\n-Finally, I won't mince words. We also serve as an extra funding board for student issues. This can range from assisting Habitat for Humanity, multicultural social events, graduate student town halls, or environmental action nights. $9,000 on just advertising is a lot to drop and plain ridiculous.
