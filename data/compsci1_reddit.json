Here's my layman's explanation.  A web service can be thought of as a software application with the following designed to send and receive information from other software applications.

Intuit's web service finds the IRS's web service, they talk to each other, and your tax info gets sent form Intuit to the IRS.\n\nOther examples of a web service:\n\n* When you log into your Android phone, you have to put in an email address and password.  There's a server on the Interwebz somewhere that sits around waiting for login information.  When the Google authentication service receives the login request, it looks up the info, and then tells the phone whether or not the request is legit.\n* When someone swipes your credit card, the credit card machine sends a request over the Internet or a phone line to a web service that determines whether or not the transaction is legit.\n* If you want an example with a little more lingo...  Twitter built the first version of Twitter using Ruby on Rails.  Twitter wants to let people post messages to Twitter, so they build a REST API that basically allows anyone to talk to Twitter's API if they use REST and follow certain instructions.

Web services work in a similar way. The consumer of the web service (i.e, a similar role to the web browser) sends a request to a URL (e.g., https://graph.facebook.com/foo?bar=baz) and the site responds back with data formatted in a way that applications have an easier time extracting.

This format is generally called a \"SOAP envelope\". A SOAP envelope contains request data, response data, or error messages. SOAP envelopes are written in XML. However, the data within SOAP envelope responses, requests, and errors do not have to be XML. They typically are XML since to use SOAP you are already using XML, but there is no requirement that the data be in any kind of format.  \n  \nA SOAP API is just an API that uses SOAP.

Firstly REST defines how clients and servers interact on a general level, but does not define protocols or data formats. It has a very specific requirements and I have yet to come across any real REST API. I have come across many REST-LIKE APIs that are really HTTP or WEB APIs. REST was invented by Roy T. Fields. For those of you reading this thinking \"NO I HAVE SEEN SO MANY REST APIS\" well no...you haven't. The industry has pretty much bastardized what Roy T Fields was attempting to describe. You can read his thoughts [here](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) where he goes over why your HTTP/WEB API isn't REST. \n\nI personally don't really care, but if you are going to take a scholastic outlook on this you might as well use the proper definitions. Just be aware that in the industry no one really cares what Roy T. Fields has to say about whether there web services fit his definition of REST or not. It is kind of beyond his control now. So, if you are looking to me as any kind of authority figure, I personally bless your decision to call your HTTP/WEB API, REST.\n\nRESTful services as Roy T. Fields describes them is a utopian outlook on what a web services should be. However, the reality is that the things Mr. Fields defines a REST service to be are incredibly hard to create. There are also no frameworks or examples of how to implement a RESTful web service. Much of his definition is lots of magic hand-waving with no concrete examples. That being said, just be aware that most people pick and choose the basic ideas of REST and implement a WEB/HTTP API then call it a REST API.\n\nThe core ideas that implementers take will vary from implementation to implementation. However the basic idea of REST usually stays intactl; that is that each unique URL should reference a single noun (e.g. a user, a phone, etc) and that you should be doing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on nouns. There are no verbs in RESTful APIs outside of the protocol chosen (most choose HTTP which supports the verbs GET, PUT, DELETE, POST). If you are using a URL in a RESTful web service like http://example.com/api/user/13434/reset_password, then you are using verbs. Specifically you are using the verb 'reset' to act upon 'password' and that isn't RESTful. \n  \n  \n\n**HTTP/WEB APIs**  \n  \n  \n\nPretty much everything you see implemented as REST APIs are this. They follow the basic idea of REST as described in the previous paragraph. However, they mix in verbs sometimes, don't include a fully described noun response, etc. Just read the common things people don't do for [their \"REST\"](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) API and that is pretty much a HTTP/WEB API.  \n  \n  \n\n&gt;Is XML like HTML? It is a code based language? Or is XML just the ability to see things as they are written (see the actual code as opposed to the results)?  \n\nHTML and XML are not the same, but they look similar. They look the same because they share a similar inspiration [SGML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language). However HTML is not XML because it allows very basic rules of XML to be violated. I suppose you could say that HTML is the red-headed step-child of SGML and that XML is the more legitimate child. There is also XHTML which is XML. XHTML took the intention of HTML (to make web pages) and attempted to make it follow all the rules of XML. It was pretty cool, but honestly most people decided it wasn't worth the effort. Thus, we have HTML5 which isn't XML either.\n\nXML is not \"code\" as I personally define it. I also do not define HTML as a \"language\" because it isn't what computer scientists would call a regular language. XML ... could be...if you try really really hard, but the original intention of  XML is to be a data format. It is text that can be parsed to create a meaningful data structure that can then be manipulated or presented. I also consider HTML to be a data format that describes web pages. XML and HTML do not have control structures (IF, WHILE, FOR) nor do they allow you to compute anything. You will find people in the software industry who call HTML/XML code and that is fine as it doesn't really corrupt the idea they are trying to present to you.\n\nXML is a data format at the core. It says the elements look like this: &lt;someElement&gt;&lt;/someElement&gt; and that those elements can have attributes &lt;someElement attribute1=\"Some attribute\"&gt;&lt;/someElement&gt;. Elements can also contain other elements or data : &lt;someElement&gt;&lt;childElement&gt;Some Data&lt;/childElement&gt;&lt;/someElement&gt;.\n\nXML also allows you create rules for elements. Those rules can be just about anything you can think of.\n\n* how long/short the data within an element can be\n* what kinds of attributes it can have\n* what elements can go within what other elements\n* how many of an element can exist within another element\n* etc\n\nThere are even standards that allow you to define types of data within an element. The some of the basic ones are:\n\n* xsd:Date\n* xsd:String\n* xsd:Integer\n* etc\n\nXML further lets you create your own types to create a set definitions that fits your needs.\n\nEssentially XML lets you use the XML format and then create whatever rules around it you want as for how the actual elements are laid out and what they describe.

Good manuscripts will make the \u201cfront page\u201d, their visibility will increase as they\u2019re targeted to \u201chigh value\u201d lists, and poor quality manuscripts will fall to the bottom. However, all manuscripts will remain visible/searchable, allowing an idea ahead of its time to receive proper recognition with age.

It would have completely open access. It would eliminate submitter/reader fees, freeing information to all. It would have other perks, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We envision this system laid out in a three-tier system with a \u201cdashboard\u201d type user interface. The \u201cbottom\u201d level of this system would include all data sets. Datasets would include relevant epidemiological characteristics. Datasets would be linked to citations of data within articles that\u2019d identify which pieces of data, equations, and interpretations were used therein. Checking for accurate interpretation of data by peers would be simple and limits could be built into citation software prohibiting inaccurate data utilization. All new manuscripts would be tied to data in a dataset, though the dataset used might not be new. An independent user might identify something novel in a dataset not identified by the original dataset poster, and he/she could create a separate manuscript from it, giving full credit to the original submitter with data-links. Original posters would be rewarded each time a dataset was used successfully via historical user scores mentioned throughout this article (encouraging submission of data for community processing). This system would reward transparency and thoroughness at original submission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The \u201cmiddle\u201d level of the system would include manuscripts and their associated comments. We envision this level being a split screen, allowing users to read the new manuscript, while older manuscripts cited in the new manuscript would come directly into view on the second screen (this could be customizable to allow several manuscripts and data, multiple manuscripts, and outside sources to be viewed simultaneously for cross-referencing). Users could read new manuscripts, give them a rating, and leave comments with citations in the form of discussion here. Comments could address issues with new manuscripts, or the data underlying new manuscripts, directly. Consequently, rather than discrete manuscripts, new information would be disseminated as a novel dialogue, allowing important commentary on new ideas to be included in the historical record (ensuring accountability for new information, providing context, and facilitating quicker synthesis of new ideas with older ideas). As above, good manuscripts/comments would float to the top via a strong score, rewarding the submitter and the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The \u201ctop\u201d level of this system would be an information synthesis similar to Wikipedia. This level would allow users to cite and synthesize information from manuscripts and comments (as well as, initially, from outside sources) in discrete articles \u201cabout\u201d scientific topics. This level eliminates the need for independent external publishing sources, as all discrete information at this level could be linked directly to relevant manuscripts/comments discussing it, making \u201ctruth\u201d easily linked to primary sources. Again, users would be credited by the user algorithm for their contributions here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Underlying this process is an algorithm accounting for the spectrum of user contributions. A user\u2019s individual score would account for all of his historical contributions to the project, including scores for manuscripts provided, when/where/how often each manuscript is cited by other users, constructive comments left, and datasets submitted. Credentials (appointments, higher education, etc), similarly, could be accounted for in the individual user score. Value associated with comments he/she leaves on other manuscripts would take historical user score into account, weighting his/her comments fairly for historical contributions. Similarly, new manuscripts submitted by a user would receive higher/lower baseline ratings based on historical contribution. We envision this score being included on academic curricula vitae, replacing absurdly long lists of publications/abstracts that give no indication of the quality of individual manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this system is that it allows complete transparency while offering each user a historical rating assigned by his peers. It would include translation software, eliminating linguistic barriers. It would allow new literature to be targeted directly to user preferences, allowing users to customize lists of manuscripts they would like to read and review by key words, discipline, user score underlying a new manuscript, \u201chot\u2019 manuscripts receiving a lot of attention from readers/commenters, country/state/neighborhood of origin, etc. It would facilitate streamlined and effective literature searches, allowing users to search for key words across the entire body of scientific knowledge, including comments and datasets. It would force improvement of data quality by making data subject to inspection along with commentary on that data. It would facilitate high quality meta-analyses by allowing users to compile original data for processing, rather than processed data from &amp;quot;peer-reviewed&amp;quot; articles. It would eliminate siloed departmental research by opening commentary to all disciplines and encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations. And much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This system could be supported financially by grants, government funding or other charitable contributions. Alternatively, we envision this system having the potential to support itself (and be quite lucrative) through advertising revenue. Because a user\u2019s entire historical research archive would be posted, his/her search and review history would be available, his biographical sketch posted, his discipline noted, advertisers would have a wealth of information for targeting. For example, a device manufacturer selling pipette tips would know that user X recently posted a dataset in which 30,000 pipette tips were used. That company would also know that user X searched for manuscripts from users completing similar research. Consequently, it would be clear that user X purchased many, many pipette tips and advertising could reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, this is not a comprehensive characterization of the project.

Nothing more.  There's probably someone on the committee who feels that the programme isn't enough theory of computability and pure maths to just call it computer science or they want to emphasize the technology contribution in their programme or some other damn thing.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Countless hours have been wasted debating Computer versus Computing science etc.  \n\n\n&gt;Would this mean that the degree is weaker and less-skilled? If not, is there perhaps still that perception from an employer's side of things?\n\nUnlikely to matter much.  You can look at the syllabi for 3rd year courses and make sure you're getting a standard comp sci equivalent programme and go from there.  \n\n\n&gt;-We learned that all of us already enrolled in the program will be grandfathered in, and so by the time we earn the degree it will have changed to Computer Information Systems, but we'll all still have the option to have our degrees be in Computer Science Technology. What do you think is the better choice in this regard?\n\nPersonally I would choose CS technology, since CIS sounds more like its database focused but it's basically irrelevant in broader marketplace.  I say this with the place I did my CS undergrad being a \"CIS\" school though.  Grad schools don't care, employers in the local area don't care. \n\n&gt; (on accreditation) Is this an important distinction \n\nNot hugely, but it can't hurt.  \n\n&gt; Is this perception just flat-out incorrect\n\nThe perception the two are hugely different would be incorrect.  The perception that people would tend to think having the proper phrase \"computer science\" in it is preferable is true. \n\n&gt; I'm 29 now, so I've got to make sure I'll still be a competitive job candidate as I age.\n\nYou're not hugely disadvantaged then. \n\n\n\nHonestly, you're a bit too focused on the details for your own good.  It sounds weird to say you're asking too many questions when you're talking about 10's of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of your time.

Nothing more.  There&amp;#39;s probably someone on the committee who feels that the programme isn&amp;#39;t enough theory of computability and pure maths to just call it computer science or they want to emphasize the technology contribution in their programme or some other damn thing.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about it.  Countless hours have been wasted debating Computer versus Computing science etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would this mean that the degree is weaker and less-skilled? If not, is there perhaps still that perception from an employer&amp;#39;s side of things?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlikely to matter much.  You can look at the syllabi for 3rd year courses and make sure you&amp;#39;re getting a standard comp sci equivalent programme and go from there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;-We learned that all of us already enrolled in the program will be grandfathered in, and so by the time we earn the degree it will have changed to Computer Information Systems, but we&amp;#39;ll all still have the option to have our degrees be in Computer Science Technology. What do you think is the better choice in this regard?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I would choose CS technology, since CIS sounds more like its database focused but it&amp;#39;s basically irrelevant in broader marketplace.  I say this with the place I did my CS undergrad being a &amp;quot;CIS&amp;quot; school though.  Grad schools don&amp;#39;t care, employers in the local area don&amp;#39;t care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(on accreditation) Is this an important distinction &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not hugely, but it can&amp;#39;t hurt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is this perception just flat-out incorrect&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The perception the two are hugely different would be incorrect.

This could really pique their interest and help them realize that programming is not just for adults\n\n\nPersonally, for me my first interest in programming came about through video games. I got my hands on some level editors for the original Wolfenstein 3D and Doom games. This introduced me to gifs/sprites, textures, CAD design, triggers, sectors, sound FX, midi, etc.\n\nAs I customized each of these, I started becoming more and more interested in HOW games worked more than I did actually playing them. I got incredible joy out of sharing my creations with others and seeing them interact with it. This, IMO, cuts to the essential nature of what makes programming fun as explained by the famous Fred Brooks:\n\n&gt; Why is programming fun? What delights may its practioner expect as his reward?\n&gt;First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.\n\n&gt; Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil holder \"for Daddy's office.\"\n\n&gt;Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.\n\n&gt;Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.\n\n&gt;Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. (...)\n\n&gt;Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separately from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.\n\n&gt;Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.\n\nWith this familiarity with even the concept of programming, I was able to begin programming my TI calculators in Trig class to check my work. The teacher would teach the concept for the day and I'd write a program/function that'd do that type of problem.
