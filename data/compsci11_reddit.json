The biggest problem being that she has *no idea* what algorithm was used to generate it. There are dozens of symmetric encryption algorithms in use, and at least a few fairly popular ones.

(See: Bitcoin and other examples of using GPUs to compute hashes at ludicrously high speed.) But you&amp;#39;d notice that, probably -- it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a &lt;em&gt;dip&lt;/em&gt; in framerate, it&amp;#39;d be a &lt;em&gt;falling-off-a-cliff&lt;/em&gt; in framerate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s realistic, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong -- the more damage a botnet does to its hosts, the more likely it is the botnet will be discovered, investigated, and destroyed, or at least lose its best hosts as users take their computers in for repair. There are a few quiet, long-running botnets (that we know about) which are hard to kill partly because they don&amp;#39;t affect the host machine enough for the host to notice or care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also terrifying, because it makes you actually believe this could be your computer right now (even if you&amp;#39;ve been careful), and because it shows that this botnet author actually put a lot of work and care into making it capable of distributing compute-intensive jobs to an absurd number of nodes, horizontally-scaling well enough that each node doesn&amp;#39;t notice, presumably with appropriate caps built-in so that nodes never utilize enough to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you want this to be less terrifying, have the faceless users notice their machines slow to a crawl, visibly stutter, fans spin up producing a steady whine and an ever-increasing amount of heat... And then return to normal a few moments later. The users hopefully shrug it off as yet another bug in their game or browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5hzf7v", "flair_text": null, "created": 1343025654.0, "created_utc": 1343022054.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 0, "link_id": "t3_wyxxm", "children": [], "author": "BobHHowell", "id": "c5hy18o", "parent_id": "t3_wyxxm", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 1, "body": "**Potential Plot Point*\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\n\nWhile not directly related to your question, MD5 has a vulnerability you could exploit for your plot.  \n\nSay a character has an important list like the \"Knock List\" from the first Mission Impossible movie.

I would like to write one implementation of it (per target language), then be able to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the macro with the appropriate code snippets, and have the (host language) compiler write it out and inline it for me. The target language compiler would then be able to compile it as if I had written it by hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize that this can be faked to some extent with function pointers, but sometimes you want something to be entirely inlined. For example, if you are searching for a file recursively, it&amp;#39;s equivalent to graph traversal. It would be very nice if you could just say graphDepthFirstSearch(...) with a little code as arguments and then not have to write it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the more basic algorithms are automated and standardized (even if it&amp;#39;s just standardized to a particular programmer), the less code you have to debug. If you know that your implementation of A* works, and your code that uses it doesn&amp;#39;t work, the problem must be somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I would like to be able to add features to the target language. I would like to be able to use Matlab&amp;#39;s multiple return values in C++, or Python&amp;#39;s array slices in C, or C++&amp;#39;s operator overloading in Java. I would, of course, accept that my implementations would be far less efficient than they would be if they were built in to the target language&amp;#39;s compiler, but I would accept this in exchange for faster coding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) I&amp;#39;d like compile-time for loops and expansion of constant-sized arrays. This way you can define a Point class which has 3 or 4 coordinates, but you don&amp;#39;t have to write out getters and setters for each coordinate. But inside the Point class, you could just refer to &amp;quot;coordinates[2]&amp;quot; and have the macro compiler change that to &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not really interested in a base language which allows for these particular features, mainly because these are just examples.

This idea seems pretty simple, so I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m not the first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know of a good language which does this?

It would be very nice if you could just say graphDepthFirstSearch(...) with a little code as arguments and then not have to write it out.\n\nFurthermore, the more basic algorithms are automated and standardized (even if it's just standardized to a particular programmer), the less code you have to debug. If you know that your implementation of A* works, and your code that uses it doesn't work, the problem must be somewhere else.\n\n3) I would like to be able to add features to the target language. I would like to be able to use Matlab's multiple return values in C++, or Python's array slices in C, or C++'s operator overloading in Java. I would, of course, accept that my implementations would be far less efficient than they would be if they were built in to the target language's compiler, but I would accept this in exchange for faster coding.\n\n4) I'd like compile-time for loops and expansion of constant-sized arrays. This way you can define a Point class which has 3 or 4 coordinates, but you don't have to write out getters and setters for each coordinate. But inside the Point class, you could just refer to \"coordinates[2]\" and have the macro compiler change that to \"y\".\n\n---\n\nI am not really interested in a base language which allows for these particular features, mainly because these are just examples. I'd like something that can work for ANY target language. It does not have to work for every target language simultaneously: I'm ok with writing Dijkstra's algorithm once for each target language I'm going to use.\n\nI've done a little searching, but I haven't found anything that sounds quite like what I want. This idea seems pretty simple, so I'm sure I'm not the first.\n\nDoes anyone know of a good language which does this? Have you worked with it much?\n\nedit: Merged in a few things that I had in the comments.", "saved": false, "id": "wrrt4", "clicked": false, "title": "Macro Programming Language", "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 1, "link_id": "t3_wrrt4", "children": [], "author": "case-o-nuts", "id": "c5fvwlg", "parent_id": "t3_wrrt4", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 6, "body": "`cpp` is shipped with most C compilers, and allows you to run the C preprocessor over any source.

Processing human language is harder for computers than humans, great, but why should that be the touchstone of intelligence? Like Russel and Norvig say, defining AI as fooling humans into thinking you're human is like defining artificial flight as fooling pigeons into thinking you're a pigeon.\n\n&gt; Could a computer have determined a blog\u2019s political stance on its own? Unlikely.

Both of these guys play down the useful ability of the other to make themselves feel better (&amp;quot;bah, learning to code is easy, theory is the hard part&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bah, hes all book smarts, but can&amp;#39;t code for shit&amp;quot;), but really, you need experience AND theory if you want to stick out to employers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of a serious project now, one that you&amp;#39;ll be passionate about, forget making money on, and just code it. My first &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; project was a search engine when I was 14. I wanted to compete with Google, lol. Perhaps my naivety was a good thing because I did write my search engine, and it went on my resume, and being able to discuss the finer points of algorithms and theories while pointing to a project where you used them and built it entirely on your own is like a recruiters wet dream. Anyway, good luck. Hopefully my story helps you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "more_comments": "", "subreddit": "compsci", "flair_class": null, "has_more_comments": false, "name": "t1_c5c6kaq", "flair_text": null, "created": 1341962397.0, "created_utc": 1341958797.0, "num_reports": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhmr", "banned_by": null, "downvotes": 2, "link_id": "t3_wbvkb", "children": [], "author": "b1tsh1ft", "id": "c5c2jrt", "parent_id": "t3_wbvkb", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "upvotes": 10, "body": "All the talk you hear about people being successful in software development without a computer science or other related degree is the exception, not the norm.

I wired up networks and set up Netware servers, I debugged programs for students, I wrote network support programs in C and Assembly, I backed up the BBS system, I configured print servers and helped manage a IBM 370 Mainframe, and lots of other stuff. Not to mention tutoring students when they didn't have a clue and their teacher could not help them. Stuff that helped me land big paying jobs later and stuff not taught in college at that time.\n\nStay in college, you need your Bachelors degree just to get past HR, they discriminate against anyone who doesn't at least have a Bachelors degree. How to get past the rest, well don't write a form letter and don't copy paste stuff when you write a cover letter or email to HR. Write how you can help the company after doing some research on what they do and what they use, and then list your skills on the cover letter or email as well as your experience and things like that.

Keep that in mind in case you switch to part-time in order to get a part-time job to make ends meet. I had to do that myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did at one time quit college, and went to a junior college part-time while I worked part-time, as long as I stayed in college part-time I was able to go without paying off my loan. I earned an Associates and later on in life a Bachelors. If I had it to do all over again I&amp;#39;d attend the junior college/ community college and then transfer to a four year college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you see working part-time in the junior college computer lab I learned a lot for minimum wage. I wired up networks and set up Netware servers, I debugged programs for students, I wrote network support programs in C and Assembly, I backed up the BBS system, I configured print servers and helped manage a IBM 370 Mainframe, and lots of other stuff. Not to mention tutoring students when they didn&amp;#39;t have a clue and their teacher could not help them. Stuff that helped me land big paying jobs later and stuff not taught in college at that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay in college, you need your Bachelors degree just to get past HR, they discriminate against anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t at least have a Bachelors degree. How to get past the rest, well don&amp;#39;t write a form letter and don&amp;#39;t copy paste stuff when you write a cover letter or email to HR. Write how you can help the company after doing some research on what they do and what they use, and then list your skills on the cover letter or email as well as your experience and things like that. A human being reads them and throws out canned responses, and doesn&amp;#39;t take time to read resumes which is why you put your relevant info in the cover letter or email.
